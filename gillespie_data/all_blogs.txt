# Motto: Beverly Hills- that's where I want to be.

I'm going to keep this as short as possible. There is a LOT to cover if I want to cover everything, so I should keep rambling to a minimum if I can. Rambling. [Ram Bling](http://www.amazon.com/Bling-Jewelry-Sterling-Silver-Pendant/dp/B004I3NNFY). Weird. Minimum. [Mini Mum](http://www.amazon.com/Dimensions-Needlecrafts-Feltworks-Mini-Mums/dp/B0013AK8V2/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1346387797&sr=8-6&keywords=mini+mum). Strange. I can. [iCan](http://www.amazon.com/Progressive-International-Safety-I-Can-Opener/dp/B000T3L0R0/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1346388056&sr=1-1&keywords=iCan). Okay now you're just messing with me.

I already wrote up my Top 5. It's a photo edition Top 5. It's also a Top 15. I couldn't whittle down my trip into just 5 pictures. Even those 15 pictures don't begin to portray what a fun-packed adventure I had. I'll probably sneak a couple more here in the body of the column, just to be sneaky.

Side note: My Pandora is rocking pretty hard right now. My station named [The Greatest Station Ever](http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh750775290057158804&shareImp=true) is pretty much just that.

So. I went to California. The story, if you hadn't heard, begins with an invite from a good friend of the family, Sally Hanson. She was a bridesmaid at my sister's wedding in July. During this period she transitioned from being "friend of my family" to "a friend of mine". After the wedding, I confessed to Sally that I hadn't seen much of country and I needed to travel more. She told me she would gladly show me around California if I bought the tickets. I thought she was kidding. She wasn't.

Let me tell you two things to start this whole thing off:
1. I had an amazing time in California.
2. I had the world's greatest friend working hard to make sure that was true.

Now allow me to set the tone for the story:

![](assets/28-1.jpg)

Beautiful friends having a beautiful lunch on a beautiful beach on a beautiful day (Thesis: California is beautiful)

Rather than go through a long narrative of everything that happened during the trip, I'm going to take a barebones note structure approach (thanks education!):

Wednesday
I flew from Kansas City to Phoenix, and from Phoenix to Los Angeles. I got the seat with extra leg room again flying out of KCI. That's twice in a row.
Sally picked me up in her Prius. That car is awesome. Driving in LA looked horrible.
We went to Malibu beach. I walked in the ocean for the first time in at least 5 years.
We ate the best biscuits in the world. I'm fairly confident.
I saw Sally's neighborhood. It is cute. Where I would live if I lived in LA.
Thursday
We hiked to the Hollywood Sign. Pictures were taken from behind. Pesky fog put a slight damper on an otherwise amazing view from the top.
Life goal #1 accomplished thanks to Sally.
We met my cousin Sharon for Korean lunch. It honestly wasn't bad!
Sharon took us to Family Guy. I saw the office and what a few people do there. It was a fascinating look into a world of complexities I never even thought about.
I wish I could see Sharon more often.
Sally's friend and former coworker Auggie took us on a behind-the-scenes tour of CBS. I got a second look into the world that makes television go. An empty lot vs a fully built set. The difference is astonishing. 
Auggie was very funny and couldn't have been a better host.
Sally, her friend Huston, and I eat at a French place near her abode. 
Huston was very nice and I got to know him far less than I would have cared to. 
Sally and I went to a variety show at The Groundlings. I enjoyed it. I think Sally enjoyed it more.
Friday
I was on the phone for a good portion of the morning for a (potential, probable) work-related matter.
Sally took me paddleboarding.
I am good at balancing on a paddleboard, the thing most people have trouble with.
I am terrible at making a paddleboard go, the thing most people can do easily.
Paddleboarding absolutely destroyed my back. I spent the better portion of the evening taking it easy and taking anti-inflammitories. 
Sally's friend Ben invited her over to listen to an album on her record player.
That album turned out to be soon-to-be-released "Night Visions" by Imagine Dragons. I listened to to it with her and Ben and Dan, who just so happened to be two members of the band. No big deal.
Ben and Dan both made me laugh a lot. They, too, were good people.
I've since heard a song of theirs during the preview for "The Perks of Being a Wallflower".
Saturday
Saturday was spent mostly in the car. Sally drove us something like 10 hours up to northern California. The drive consisted of the ocean on our left, the mountains on our right. 
I got carsick cause I'm a huge wuss, noncolorfully speaking.
We talked a whoooole bunch. Luckily she is a great conversationalist.
She introduced me to "This American Life". I am now a big fan.
Italian dinner. The waiters were in formal attire. Very nice.
Sunday
Sally took me to meet her friend Greg in San Fransisco. Greg is a director, currently working on a project for the Discovery channel. We three got a spot of tea.
Soon Greg and Sally will be working together on a full-length feature film. I am fully excited for both of them.
Greg tells great stories and is was very entertaining.
I met Sally's friend Audrey and her husband Kyle. We went shopping for a dinner party.
We had said dinner party. There I met Sally's mother and sister.
All those involved made me feel right at home. The dinner was delicious and the party was one of my favorite nights, entirely thanks to the people.
Monday
I.
WENT.
TO.
GOOGLE.
I had lunch at Google with Sally and a designer named Michael. He introduced us to a few of his fellow Googlers and told Sally and I what to see on campus.
I'm glad Sally is a great people person. I was too stoked/overwhelmed/excited to do or say anything of actual value.
We went to the Google Store. I got $140 worth of Google swag. I call it swag cause that's what they called it. I paid for it using my Android phone and Google Wallet (naturally)
We also watched the movie Premium Rush. Google outshined the movie easily.
GOOGLE! THE GOOGLE!
Life goal #2 accomplished thanks to Sally
Tuesday
I ate breakfast with three Hansons. They are great people. I was glad I got to see them again. Can't wait for next time.
We went to a redwood forest. The trees there reminded me of myself. Tall and extremely good looking.
I saw a couple small towns where I could easily see myself settling down with a family.
I saw Sally's high school. It was strangely deserted for being in session.
We ate and hung out on the beaches of northern California for the better part of the day. It was a perfect cap on the perfect trip, to be cliched.
Wednesday #2
I swallowed sadness and flew home.
Don't get me wrong. I love the people here. I just don't love the +20 degree temperature difference and the lack of a certain very charismatic and enthusiastic friend.
The whole experience opened my eyes to not only the great ways of California, but the greatness of travel and new life experiences. As they say, I was blind, but now I see.


Tyler, I want you to really listen to me... My eyes are open.
That Fight Club reference didn't match the picture in mood or tone... but if I get an opportunity to reference Fight Club you should bet I'll do it.

Reoccurring themes from the trip:
Sally's friends and family are wonderful, treated me very nicely, and were generally fun to be around.
Sally impressed me in some new way.
I don't think I've ever owed anyone a bigger thank you in my entire life. I don't know how I could possibly begin to repay her. I will start by just saying it...

Thank you, Sally.


# Top 15: (my) pictures from this trip (in chronological order)
15. I arrived at the airport to leave an hour and half early due to eagerness. The terminal was empty.
![](assets/28-2.jpg)
14. The first place Sally took me was a beach in Malibu. It yielded one of my favorite pictures from the whole trip.
![](assets/28-3.jpg)
13. We hiked the Hollywood sign... ended up behind it somehow. The fog makes this picture not do justice for how beautiful Los Angeles is. Also worth noting: LA is more to the right.
![](assets/28-4.jpg)
12. We met with my cousin Sharon for Korean lunch. The stuff in those bowls was mostly edible food!
![](assets/28-5.jpg)
11. Sharon is a character designer at Family Guy (not pictured) also, sometimes American Dad (pictured!). Side note: The bottle I'm holding is carbonated water. Apparently that's a thing there. I don't get it.
![](assets/28-6.jpg)
10. Sally used to work at CBS. She pulled a few strings and I a one-man tour of their lot. I saw, among other awesome things, the Big Wheel!
![](assets/28-7.jpg)
9. This is the air of confidence of a man who thinks he can probably handle paddleboarding on the Pacfic.
![](assets/28-8.jpg)
8. This is the stubbornly defeated pose of a man who can make a paddleboard turn, but can't make it go forward.
![](assets/28-9.jpg)
7. San Fransisco has a hill or two.
![](assets/28-10.jpg)
6. This picture was taken just to prove Sally is a hippie hippie hippie.
![](assets/28-11.jpg)
5. I got some swag at Google. I WENT TO GOOGLE. AAAAAA!!!!!!!
![](assets/28-12.jpg)
4. 1 big goof and 3 wonderful wonderful people. Breakfast with the Hansons.
![](assets/28-13.jpg)
3. Amongst the redwoods I never felt more at home.
![](assets/28-14.jpg)
2. Northern California beaches are definitely my cup of tea. I had a cup of tea in San Fransisco, by the way. Not shown: the sequence of shots showing that I fell over backwards doing this handstand.

# Workout Routine

I’ve been doing the same *basic* routine for the past few years, for the most part. I don’t *think* I’ve ever shared it on here. It was New Year’s Resolutions time, so why not share a thing that I’ve enjoyed that I believe to be pretty alright.

## Aaron's Workout Routine Overview

Full body. No set “days per week”, but ideally at least 3. Each workout is built around three of the “big 6” compound exercises, one or two sets of accessory exercises, and takes around 45 minutes to complete. 

![[448-1.png]]

Compound exercises 1, 2, and 3 are dependent on the day.

| Day | 5x5 Lift | 4x7 Lift | 3x10 Lift | Accessory Focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Day A | Squat | Bench | Pull Up | Chest |
| Day B | Deadlift | Bent Over Row | Overhead Press | Biceps |
| Day C | Pull Up | Squat | Bench | Core |
| Day D | Overhead Press | Deadlift | Bent Over Row | Shoulders |
| Day E | Bench | Pull Up | Squat | Shoulders |
| Day F | Bent Over Row | Overhead Press | Deadlift | Triceps |

Proceed through the days A to F in order. Then start again at A. 

Miscellaneous notes:

- You can swap out similar variations for any given compound exercise (e.g. incline bench instead of bench).
- Weighted pull-ups and assisted pull-ups should be used to hit the rep ranges.
- Rest periods should be 1-3 minutes between sets

# Meta Routine

It’s not “optimal” to literally do **the same** routine for forever. Your body adapts to new loads and stressors, then you hit a plateau. This is the law of diminishing returns in action. To combat this, you have to change things up from time to time. **But** - if you’re constantly changing things up, you may not stay on any one thing long enough to *progress* it. So, the right approach is *something in between*. Many workout programs are scheduled to last for 8 to 12 weeks with this in mind. The approach to how you vary your routine up over time is something I’ve not paid enough attention to historically. That’s changing this year.

### Quarterly Routine Change

In 2024 I am going to do four different workout routines. Change things around and try to learn some. So for the next 3 months I’m **not** doing the routine from above that I’ve been using for years. Instead I’m doing a push/pull/legs routine, which plays nicely into my 3-2-1 goal[^1]. 

I haven’t planned the whole year out yet, but by the end of the year this table will be full.

| Jan, Feb, Mar | Apr, May, Jun | Jul, Aug, Sep | Oct, Nov, Dec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Push/Pull/Legs | Dunno yet | Dunno yet | Only curls all day |
| Eating slightly more | Dunno yet | Eating slightly less | Dunno yet |

## System Synergies

One neat thing about this approach is that it lines up with my [Generalized Fitness Benchmark tests](https://aarongilly.com/379/). I will be doing the same test at the end of each 3 month routine. In theory this should allow me to objectively observe results of each time span. 

Also, obviously, my Personal Data Warehouse keeps me honest. 

# Workout Apps

This post is too long. I switched weightlifting apps after 8 years with the Strong App. I now use [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com), which is essentially a clone of Strong, but with additional niceties. I recommend it.

Sadly, there isn’t a workout app that tracks *per lift* strength training progress **and** heart rate/pacing info during runs. So, my tools for fitness tracking are still an amalgamation of things.



# Top 5: Unrelated Things



## 5. Spotlight!

Spotlight is a feature of iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS. It is part search box, part command prompt, and **it’s the main way I do LOTS of things** on my iPad and Mac. It is single-handedly the main reason why I now get a little bit frustrated when I switch to my Windows machine or any of my Raspberry Pis (which run Linux).

The shortcut to pull up spotlight is `cmd + space`. I use it for:

- Opening new apps
- Running Siri Shortcuts (which I do multiple times/day)
- Adding new reminders
- Adding new events to my calendar
- Initiating Google Searches
- Doing math calculations & unit conversions
- Changing settings



## 4. Podcast!

I have one again. Same name. *“We Scene a Movie”* wherever you get your podcasts. Or [here](https://shows.acast.com/we-scene-a-movie).

![[448-2.png]]



## 3. Tools!

I updated [[Tools I Use|my public repo of tools I use]]. It’s current. Also it exists, if you didn’t know.



## 2. Notes!

I’ve written two Columns’ worth of material on accident. My next Column will come in a week and be about my notes, which I’ve recently figured out how to re-publish to the internet.



## 1. Life!

Despite the cold spell. Despite slow progress on some long-term projects. Despite the terrible 3s. Life is really good. I'm happy. In case you were wondering.

# Motto: Mottos are good for intros, but can be vague or confusing

This column is dedicated mostly to things I thought about during my Thailand trip that didn't necessarily really belong on the last post. When contemplating things, I almost always make mental pros and cons lists - so that is the theme for today's post.

## Delta Airlines:
For my travels to Thailand, I flew Delta. Normally I book travel through a Expedia or Kayak or some other 3rd party travel site; but for this trip I went directly through the airline's website. Here are some thoughts about that and about my experiences on this trip:

Pros:
Going directly through the airline's website makes flight switching and cancellations easier.
Delta in particular offers a spectacular in-flight experience for international travel. Each passenger has a ~8 inch touch screen built into the seat in front of him. This screen rotates up and down to accommodate different heights. Things available for FREE: Movies. Music. TV shows. Games. And the selection was actually really good; and YOU got to pick what YOU wanted to watch/do WHEN and IF you wanted. Here's a very incomplete list of what they had:
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
All four Pirates movies
All three Batman movies (the new ones)
500 Days of Summer 
Silver Linings Playbook
Star Trek (the new one)
All the Avengers movies (which I'm writing more about in my next column)
The Watch
Yes Man
Wreck it Ralph
The two most recent Bourne movies
Brave
Bridesmaides
Crazy, Stupid Love
The Departed
Horrible Bosses
How to Train Your Dragon
In Bruges
Les Miserable
All three Lord of the Rings
The Hobbit
And probably a hundred more.

Cons:
Delta is not impervious to delays. I had 6 total flights on this trip. 2 of them were delayed. I am so very fortunate that it happened to be the last leg of the journey both times (I didn't have subsequent flights to miss).

## The Metric System & Money:
Thailand uses the metric system. Thai money is called "Baht", and each baht is roughly 3 cents in American money. Here are my thoughts about both of those things:
Pros:
When pricing things in stores, baht makes more sense. You want a candy bar and a water? That's 30 baht. It's not "$1.98... but really $2.27 with tax". The system is easier and more logical. Another thing I came to appreciate is how the value of their coins and bills is weighted. In America, $1 doesn't get you much of anything. If you want a cheap meal, you usually need a $5 plus some additional bills or coins. Baht is different. Baht comes in coin form, then there are 20, 100, 500, and 1000 baht bills (that I saw). This translates to ~$0.66, ~$1.33, $16.67, and $33.33. Things over there are a little bit cheaper in general, so these amounts work out pretty well. A 20 baht bill gets you a snack. 100 baht bill gets you a meal. 500 baht gets you a new outfit. 1000 baht will feed you for a week at the grocery store. The value their bills are broken into makes paying for thing with physical money less of a hassle.
I like kilometers. They are more useful than miles. A mile is a loooong distance. Within a city, miles are almost useless. You have to say things like "half a mile", "quarter of a mile", etc. The precision you get with Kilometers is useful in urban environments. Also for speed.
Kilograms and grams make more sense to me than pounds and ounces. Why is there 16 ounces in a pound? Why is base 10 wrong all of the sudden? And why 16? If you're going to break base 10 for anything - choose base 12. Or base 2. The electrical engineer in me makes me have to include that (I'm neglecting to mention that base 16 is also important for EE work).

Cons:
Their bills are all different lengths. The higher value bills are longer than the smaller value bills. This makes sense, but it's not as convenient for bill storage.
Meters aren't as useful for measuring height. For me, it's easier to break down height into X feet and Y inches, instead of just Z centimeters. It's kind of the opposite of the money situation.
Celsius is only 5/9ths as precise as Fahrenheit. In my life, the relevant temperatures exist (except for the extreme cases) between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In Celsius this roughly corresponds to -18 and 38 degrees. Fahrenheit makes more sense in terms of daily life. I am not water.
I wish the whole world ran the same system... that I got to orchestrate. 

## EDC Bag:
Thailand marked the first time I got to use my Maxpedition Sitka the way I always envisioned it being used. It was an illuminating experience and it made me aware of some things I didn't know I liked about the bag and some things I didn't know I didn't like. My thoughts:
Pros:
My bag has some security features built in that I never really appreciated before. The zippers of all three main compartments can be pulled to a single point of the bag. At this point is a tie-down system that you can corral and cinch down all the zippers in. This system is subtle and its use is entirely optional. If you choose to use it, to get into any of the compartments, you have to uncinch the tie-down cord, loosen it, then do the zipping. This theft deterrent was much appreciated when I had a bag containing everything important in my life behind me on a very crowded bus or train. It adds some confidence that you'd notice if someone was trying to get into your bag.
The integrated water bottle holder is fantastic. Nalgenes fit like a glove and hold a LOT of water. There are two different places within the bag that perfectly accommodate my tablet. This allows for some flexibility with packing things.
The one-shoulder sling-around design is awesome. When sitting on public transportation I didn't have to stop and awkwardly flail my elbows around to remove my bag before sitting down. I just slung the bag around in front of me and plopped down with it on my chest. When I did that, I could easily get in to my stuff.
The Sitka is the perfect size for your "personal item" on an airplane. It is small enough to slide easily under the seat in front of you and leave some foot room, but big enough to carry entertainment for a 12 hour flight.
I think the bag looks kind of cool. In pictures it looks like it is meant to be there, at least moreso than a bookbag. It seems more of a "part of you/your outfit", and less of an afterthought.

Cons:
The one-shoulder design causes back pain and more shoulder fatigue than I expected. You can mitigate this by packing lightly, but it only helps to a point. Even with only the absolute bare essentials, your shoulder and back will hurt after a few hours of walking. This could be aided by a bag that allows you to switch shoulders... but the Sitka doesn't. Cinching the whole bag tighter to my torso and using the supplemental stabling strap helps... but not enough. I had to strap it on backwards or take it off and carry it like a briefcase to give my shoulder and back a break on a daily basis.
Originally I thought the Sitka was the perfect size for every occasion... but I was wrong. It's too small to pack for a 3 day trip (where something the size of a full bookbag would be perfect) and packing for a day of walking around leaves a ton of empty space (the main compartment was usually empty - all my storage needs were met by the smaller compartments). It sits at a kind of awkward in-between stage. It definitely excels more for "put your stuff in a bag to take to your friend's place for the night"-type situations.
Doing a bit more research into this area I find many of the same bags I considered originally almost a year ago. I even ran across a couple in Thailand:

![](assets/79-1.jpg)

5.11 Rush 6 - smaller & lighter but with and overall wonky appearance and without a waterbottle holder.
I am not going to get a new EDC Bag. All the ones I looked at were flawed. My Sitka is the least of all evils.

## A Week Without the Internet:
Preface
Pros:
I was a little more in the moment. The nagging thought "you should check your phone" subsided not too long after I removed my SIM card.
I had to make peace with "not knowing". This is something you don't have to do much when you have a fully functioning smartphone. How many fluid ounces are there in a cup? I didn't know. I couldn't know. I just had to be okay with not knowing.
I was more connected with nature and each of the environments I found myself in.

Cons:
I had no refuge for when things got overwhelming. If I get too stressed out by any given situation, I can usually look to my smartphone for a distracting and stress-reducing minute or two. Without it, when I was uncomfortable and Melissa wasn't available to chat, I had to sit there with my discomfort. This could be looked at as a good thing, a growing experience... but it certainly made a few occasions harder.  During the multiple occasions we were lost or hungry, I was completely unable to help. This was the cause of some of those stressful occasions I just mentioned.
I couldn't talk with anyone who wasn't directly in front of me. If I wanted to send a message to my parents that I was alive and doing fine, I had to go through Melissa. I did this on a couple of occasions - but it would have been nice to be able to send pictures and notifications when I so pleased.

The internet is home of some of the absolute greatest[^1] things that humanity has to offer. 

- [The index to all knowledge](https://www.google.com).
- [The worlds biggest and best encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org). 
- [The most advanced calculator ever conceived of](https://www.wolframalpha.com).
- [An unending font of entertainment and education](https://www.youtube.com).
- [The most dynamic organization tool ever made](https://www.notion.so).

Among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>those ranks, I believe /r/Place deserves to go down as one of humanity’s best artistic achievements.

# What is r/Place?

Reddit, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, is a social media network that likes to call itself 'the front page of the internet’. Unlike, say, Twitter or Facebook, in Reddit you don’t follow individual *people,* instead you follow *topics* which are are broken out into ‘**subreddits**’. Links are posted by the users in each subreddit and upvoted or downvoted depending on how much other users valued the content.

On April Fool’s day, 2017, the subreddit /r/Place was created. Unlike other subreddits, r/Place housed not only a never ending list of posts, but also a web application/distributed social art experiment.

## How it Worked

There was a canvas. Any logged-in user could choose to place a colored square *(aka ‘tile’)* somewhere on that canvas. After placing your tile, a cooldown timer counted down (typically 5 minutes) until you could place *another* tile. In theory, you could build your own little piece of art or write your name pixel-by-pixel slowly over time. But that’s not what happened. No tiles were safe. The canvas was a 1000 by 1000 grid. All one million places were filled within a couple hours. When you tried to build something by yourself, it was doomed to be covered over by a *group* of users who choose to work **together** to do something else.

Fun fact that doesn’t fit anywhere else in this post: r/Place was created by a guy named “Josh Wardle”... who also created “Wordle”.

# 2017

In 2017 I tried to make something myself, like I’m sure 90% of people who participated did. After 2 or 3 very quickly squashed attempts, I banded up with the users of /r/SHIELD to work together on a chunk of canvas that we dedicated to the then-ongoing “Agents of Hydra” subplot[^2] of Season 4 of the show “Agents of SHIELD”.

## The Final 2017 Image

This is what Reddit made, through a great and beautiful chaos, between 4/1/2017 and 4/4/2017:

![place final 2017](assets/419-2.jpg)

Here was the little chunk I helped with:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWDknhJaY85a0FGCEziII43KyMild6i1vmSsjz16z4Q9m02VclCLnJ9wEB9COKys8FP7jMidhxLRixnNFgzVI9y4OzP3G-2HBWYYc_1oMpw_1AHF2q1I6OOKj66sfWMeGSREpO_PWmKygx-hFLU9wbU3g=w662-h557-no?authuser=0](assets/419-3.jpg)

The Hydra logo is near the bottom right corner of the full image.

## Other Final Products

The final image is THE product of 2017 /r/Place... but it’s not the *only* interesting thing that came out of it. There were articles analyzing how the web app was made, how individual groups formed, and how well the content of the final image represented a cross section of internet culture at the time. There were two other big products worth mentioning.

### 2017 Timelapse

This is the entire 3 day experience packed into 46 seconds. This particular video gives you a chance to see the whole picture, but then focuses in on different sections of the board to see how the individual artworks formed, evolved, and died over time.

### 2017 Better Timelapse

[This is a scrollable, zoomable, scrubbable interactive timelapse of the whole 2017 r/Place](https://freestlr.github.io/place/). I had no idea this existed until just now. It is incredible. 

### Atlas

There’s even this wonderful [place-atlas project](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/) that shows you just how much was packed into the original r/Place. You can get lost exploring the atlas. Only the brave among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>us should dare enter.

### Legacy

The popularity of r/Place may have caught Reddit by surprise. Every single year there were plenty of users who called for a resurgence of r/Place. People asked for it to be an annual event. People reminisced about the 3 days they spent creating together. The internet, as a whole, regarded r/Place as a triumph of culture, art, community, and engineering.

# 2022

Several days in advance of April Fool’s day this year, Reddit announced they were reviving r/Place. I felt nostalgia crossed with excitement. We all knew what it was like last time. We knew to be excited. What we didn’t know, though, was that this year was going to be different. 

## Day 1

Day 1 worked **exactly** like the 2017 edition of r/Place worked. The canvas was 1000x1000. There were 16 colors. I allied up with a group of folks who were making an art piece dedicated to the long awaited sequel to my favorite game of all time - Hollow Knight. A group of subscribers to the /r/HollowKnight subreddit built a new sub specifically to coordinate the placement of HK art among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>the chaos. The new subreddit /r/hkplace spawned a Discord server, for more tactical and immediate communication, several templates were created, shared, voted on, and ultimately implemented by us 3000+ people on the Discord chat server. At the end of Day 1 we’d successfully built a 75x78 art piece in a prominent position.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUbLxHtUM-TMsTederCsxnPhJej4nB7IrBJIjzAdb988ogk98gfOxf8M3uKuya0u8keya77MAAVKceQvFp1R9ByxZ1G-QvTUxk47XMS2S6ZuM3SL_oFi3AkTogBCRTmXIdp2nCDx8txYw4xK8ZuqKfngg=w572-h569-no?authuser=0](assets/419-4.jpg)

That’s “the Hornet” from Hollow Knight, who will be the main character of the long awaited sequel “Silksong”. She was built, coincidentally, right next to the logo for the game “Elden Ring” (not pictured above). The two games share a lot of common elements and an overlapping fanbase, so the communities decided to partner up to help each other out.

## Day 2

Sometime shortly into Day 2, the canvas unexpectedly *doubled* in size to 1000x2000, and the color selection grew by 50% to 24 colors. People reformulated their plans. Groups that were already successful sometimes spawned entirely new works of art together. Groups that had previously failed tried again. We created a 2nd piece in collaboration with a dozen+ other indie game followings. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVN3kctSZoLoTkXHzJ61u8-qU0wvhhdlWDb7b_ROy1N5dAhzRPbqXFoAgrzqW7g-CKkafdnnf28vcQS79e8Mi0SdyMLL2nq_jEqreVrf0KdCIIeKkyC_UuqJhaZqQEfs-5mCL3rB4OlZeGDeR0jNjaE_A=w636-h551-no?authuser=0](assets/419-5.jpg)

The Knight from Hollow Knight is sitting with Ranni the witch, from Elden Ring, surrounded by characters from other games.

## Day 3

As most were predicting, Day 3 saw *another* expansion to both the canvas and color palette. When all was said and done, the canvas was 2000x2000, a full *four times* bigger than the original r/Place - and the color palette was *twice* as complex. Combining those factors the size, scope, and fidelity of 2022’s r/Place was completely unexpected.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVDu3xU-cu-GF2JK920_zI6ptPIN3tGsuxewzqrD5IPsWPf-WU_JWUFByUSq8epNPwvCx0hwVPqDTJwT-dVeX7uKpTZbKyzZp6arHZRdx2jGep6PzMJcrV03eFaD3bJYuTpVmSR-2G8U3dpfUffQiexjg=w831-h774-no?authuser=0](assets/419-6.jpg)

With the expanded canvas, the coordinated groups grew more and more ambitious. None moreso than the French, who claimed (and for the most part successfully defended) nearly 1/10th of the final section just by themselves.

My faction continued the collab with Elden Ring, placing yet another Hollow Knight character superimposed over a tree from the Elden Ring lore. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVYG07zxx5K9Yxt3Bp_Tt8GE0b3O28OpDPj3Oqv41PX00al7UdVGCKoaHTQQUPSOUE3RaIK_1lKik3-LvT6kI9AcKumlH3I7JvKd_ucz6N9QxMLe6ff14puxYf-3l1TdODu9h-C_m1a-HG6L4BJvKAhAQ=w640-h771-no?authuser=0](assets/419-7.jpg)

All said and done, the collaboration between r/Eldenring and /HKPlace represented 24500 pixels, aka 0.6% of the total surface area. Three thousand of us chatting, splitting into dedicated groups to serve specific roles, running democratic votes, and planning collaborations with factions representing entire *countries* managed to do something great, yet we represented less than 1 percent of the total space. If that’s not any indication of how big r/Place was, I don’t know what is.

## The End

I was there when it all disintegrated.

The original 2017 experiment ended when the site stopped letting you place new tiles. Suddenly the way things were at that moment were the way they would be **forever**. Everyone spent the past 4 days assuming that's what would happen *sometime* today. We jockeyed for position and held our territory, hoping it would look like what we wanted when time ran out. 

But that's not what happened. I was defending my chosen artwork when I noticed that the color palette went from 24 colors to **one** color: white. Reddit threw a switch and the only tiles *anyone* could place were white. So that’s what the people did. 

Everywhere, all at once, the canvas and all the collaborations amongst<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>millions of people began disintegrating at once. All we could do was watch, or help end things faster. Once the final pixel turned white, /r/Place was over.

So this is how the Place ends. Not with a bang, but with a whiter.

### The Final 2022 Image

### Interactive Timeline

Just before I posted this, Reddit publicly released everything from 2022’s r/Place - including [this scrollable, zoomable version of the Canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/?cx=1025&cy=1395&px=1225)!

### “Official” Final Image

This is the state of the canvas after the final colored tile was placed:

### Place Atlas 2

I can’t believe this got made already. [The Place Atlas 2](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/) currently has 7000 entries pointing out things in the final image and given them some context. If you were so inclined, you could waste an entire day looking around. 

Imagine if someone would do that. 
Can you imagine. 

🙄

### The Numbers

Total tiles placed: 160+ Million. Unique users who placed tiles: 10.4+ million.



# Top 5: Emergences



## 5. Better Flags

An immediate and enduring mainstay of both 2017 and 2022 was the presence of national flags... often highly elongated flags. 

In 2017 the overlapped area between the French and German flags was turned by both countries into the flag for the European Union.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLXQG45fr50rZkCb1kRxnxRHKJRsksrQ_3NbRyAyZInJUlPryunCR0w0KrVYwSjC8W0M2BvMG_krJNEbwa3y3MW6ATAfSiJW2GC4xfaJVBDcZlWeC2rvfMRHwhu1Lu91VHqaR66VIXzZ91_nLGiLNg6orQ=w505-h406-no?authuser=0](assets/419-10.jpg)

This year around, people didn’t settle for *just* a flag. Every nation that could hold the space turned their flag into a national work of art:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVEBn2KaW94cDSOwUHt73uoE22OnXDBUdoWp506TxAir7hWuXeltADnU9BE8PFNv_RAPTIEjqLojdTlIj80dLQPMEzLYPcff0q2Qkx-uLQKyjoP3fpU1RAzQC4jcWlH3sbpog0PoVNLOfC7w39bBomyEA=w961-h522-no?authuser=0](assets/419-11.jpg)



## 4. Alliance Hearts

Dotted all around the canvas between adjacent pieces of art you’ll find hearts that split in half . These came to mean the teams working on each art piece agreed to respect the border, or event to help each other out. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLXbmM90bRmNt_IyWPqbj3nFv5zlG4DRjtwkYBzK7SLl9vzm1MepROmtB7e8mxYm5RphYgZGFv9ICXnK5CRqeEtaFcWZN07ipRt1qXjwH8IryviEJ5l7LGd7W3xN3xSApNWYo1apMjqd_cqn2nT_d3FYlw=w413-h708-no?authuser=0](assets/419-12.jpg)



## 3. Memes, Video Game Characters, & Crossovers

The groups fell into four basic categories - people working in the name of a country, a video game (or video game streamer), a meme, and then everybody else. This was the pattern in 2017. It was the pattern again in 2022.



## 2. The Void

A so-called “cult” of 2017’s /r/Place was ‘The Void’. It popped up several times throughout the experiment, dragging down all surrounding art into a black spindly mass of horror. The Void came back time and time again around the canvas. It found an enduring home on Day 3’s expansion, until collectively, we reached out of the void.

Other similar factions included the Blue Corner, Rainbow Road, and the Green Lattice.



## 1. The “Amongi”<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>

Not around in 2017, the viral social game “Among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>Us” played the **biggest** role in 2022’s /r/Place. The colored Among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>Us characters with their signature backpacks and visors started popping up all over the canvas, invading every other art piece. Estimates of a single snapshot taken near the end placed the Amongi count in the mid-2000s. In every textured surface in the art we created, there would inevitably be someone hiding these characters among<span style="color:hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0)">ඞ</span>us.

Motto: the Fattening

The October Project is half over. Brief recap - I'm doing a month long project that can basically be summarized as "Eat more, workout more"; and it's half over. Although I've done a shakey-at-best job of meeting my goals, it has already revealed a couple of interesting things:

  
First off, I now weigh 227 lbs... meaning I've gained 7 pounds in 17 days. I think the majority of that weight has been in areas I wasn't hoping to gain weight in - but I think some of it went where I wanted. If I hit 235 lbs (another 7 pounds) before the end of October I'm going to **STOP**. Note that 235 lbs is _not_ my goal weight. I think 225 is probably where I'd like to be. Having said that, I'm 227 right now and still trying to gain weight because I'm stubborn and because I don't like to give up on projects.

  
The other, much more interesting thing that's happened is my macronutrient ratio has remained 99% constant. Macronutrients are basically groups of different nutrients your body needs. Some fitness folks/dietitians will tell you you should maintain certain ratios for optimal health, so I decided to track them. That's all I know about them really - other than I apparently CANNOT change my ratios! At all! I've been focusing on getting more fats and proteins... and the data shows that I absolutely cannot.  

  
Let's break it down:  

[![](assets/124-1.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--1ujkutCod4/UmCs4EN86QI/AAAAAAABBhg/vlKWAAbNuIM/s1600/Column+124+-+October+Half+Result+2.PNG)

Basically, despite an intentional change in eating habits I have only affected my macronutrient ratios by less than a percentage point.  
  
Like I said - weirdly consistent.  
  
Speaking of changes involving food -   

[![](assets/124-2.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8hD9r8725gs/UmCuY7JfZbI/AAAAAAABBho/gNsColmlU4Y/s1600/.Android+Kitkat.png)

There's still no official announcement for the Android 4.4 (Kitkat) or the Nexus 5\. I'm bummed. I ate a Kitkat today to console myself. I've eaten more Kitkats since they announced Android's upcoming "Kitkat" name than I have eaten in the past 3 years combined. I think Nestle owes Google a big thanks.  
  
Other odds & ends -  
  
I am listening to one of my favorite podcasts, [This Week in Google](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/220), and they just mentioned the _other_ podcast I always listen to, [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two). It was _awesome_.  
  
Last night I went with my good friend Nick to watch Bo Burnham do his new standup comedy routine "What". It was great. It was genius. It was probably the most entertained I've ever been by someone performing on a stage.  
  
Also - there's this picture.

Top 5: Things I'm Hoping for with the Nexus 5 (and am almost guaranteed)

5\. Your standard "faster processor, faster gpu, etc etc etc faster faster" stuff  
4\. At least a bit of a battery life bump over the Nexus 4 (keep the wireless charging, though)  
3\. Optical Image Stabilization  
2\. LTE Service  
1\. That I can get one

Motto: The Project Project is Projected to be a Success

  
I do projects. That's what I do.

  
This post will be written in a Buzzfeed-type fashion. A list of things with a picture to represent each thing. Basically I'm serving up Facebook sharing gold here.

  
**A list of the Medium-to-Long term projects I am working on (in some capacity):**  
  
[![](assets/175-1.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NXDsMIv6seQ/U5SgSchzHmI/AAAAAAABXkQ/BcDCDnsGyng/s1600/%23176+-+Don't+Panic.PNG)

  
**"Don't Panic"** \- a comprehensive review of education.   
  
Think of it as a personal wikipedia, written entirely by (and for) myself, covering the scope of things that I learned in academia. One day I realized that I wasn't going to retain everything I ever learned, but I was pretty good and taking what I learned, organizing it, and presenting it in such a way I could _relearn_ it quickly. The project is still in its early beginning stages even though I started it over 3 years ago. One day I'll pick it back up and keep going with it. Then I'll give it to my children, who will find it very helpful (provided they study Electrical Engineering).  
  
[![](assets/175-2.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6IpkV7pYL50/U5SkV8-eZvI/AAAAAAABXk8/%5Fmfj4ke-pDI/s1600/%23177+-+Website.PNG)

  
**http://aarongilly.com or http://wvz7x7.com or whatever** \- a legitimized website version of the Column with bonus whatever else I feel like putting up there.  
  
I have given a brief history of the Column several times throughout the Column (there's a whole "meta" tag for a reason). Basically, it all started with a geocities site. Then Xanga. Then a website. Then Tumblr. Then this Blogger. All previous instantiations of the Column are long gone. I'd like to go _back_ to a website now that I have an idea of what I'm doing. Incorporate videos, projects, blogs, pictures, whatever I feel like. Yup.  
  
[![](assets/175-3.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r4e3UrRNI00/U5SunCQ1zmI/AAAAAAABXls/fkfYyjpu3H0/s1600/%23176+-+Second-a-Day+Videos.PNG)

  
**"My Nth Year"** \- My running video-for-a-second-a-day project.  
  
I stole the idea for "[My 24th Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8%5FAwZQKjplc)" from a video called "What Madeline Did in 2011" that I found early on in 2012\. I'd link to her video, but it's pulled down. You can find re-uploads of it if you Google it, though. Either way. I successfully filmed every day last year and put together my favorite video I've ever made. I'm 54 days away from completing "My 25th Year". That means I"m 55 days away from starting "My 26th Year". I don't plan on stopping this project any time soon. Maybe at my funeral there will be a screening of a (hopefully) super long video where you can see snippets of my entire life. Maybe not.  
  
[![](assets/175-4.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AJc4yJtBNZM/U5SxcJaue7I/AAAAAAABXmA/nrtcDOATtbw/s1600/%23176+-+Life+Tracker.PNG)
  
  
**The Life Tracker** \- My running "track ALL the things!" project.  
  
A year and a couple of months back I had an idea for a huge project: a one-stop-shop for tracking everything in life that I was letting run away from me. Over the next few weeks I learned how to write scripts for Google Spreadsheets and Google Forms and threw together the Life Tracker. It has been expanded upon and improved for over a year now. I've managed to track about 75% of the weeks between its initial inception and today. In fact, today is marks the end of my 40th week Life Tracking. Thanks to this project I can tell you that I eat 2635 calories/day on average. Those calories are 34.5% from fat, 45.2% from carbohydrates, 19.9% from protein, and 0.4% from alcohol (I only know that one because of the process of elimination). I work out 2.4 times per week (not enough). I spend too much money. I am better at accomplishing managerial and social tasks than I am mental, physical, and work related ones.

**Build a Computer** \- from scratch ("scratch").  
  
I know phones pretty well. I am alright with tablets, too. I do _not_ know computers. This is pretty bad for a guy who studied Computer Engineering for a few weeks (in my defense, I _did_ change majors for a reason). I want a future-proof rig built around my personal tastes and needs. That is to say, one with a boatload of storage and the internals necessary for prosumer-level video editing. I think I'll be a videomaker for quite some time into the future.  
  
[![](assets/175-6.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BZBitWcJii4/U5S37Fcs2dI/AAAAAAABXmo/1L7ha%5FKUofc/s1600/%23176+-+Linux.png)

  
**Leave Windows** \- Microsoft, more like Microhard...ly interested.  
  
That was stretch. Anyway, I don't like Microsoft anymore. I don't want to depend on any of their products in my everyday life. While I do a hefty portion of my computing on my Chromebook nowadays, Chromebooks will probably never full encompass all my computing needs. I'm mostly interested in Linux at this point, but I haven't ruled out joining the legions of Apple users, either. I'm waiting for Elementary OS ISIS to come out and My 26th Year video to come to a close before I start considering the switch. A major limiting factor right now is the decrepit state of Video Editors on Linux. I will retain hope.

**Android Development** \- writing applications for Android.  
  
I am a huge fan of Android. I have coding experience. Why don't I write applications for Android? That's a great question. I've taken preliminary planning steps towards my ultimate goal of creating a _better_ Life Tracker as an Android application. I could write a whole post about my plans for this, but I'll just leave it off with the rough screen mockup from above. I'm waiting to set up a coding environment until after Google I/O at the end of this month... also maybe until I make the switch from Windows to something else. Maybe I'll develop on that Linux computer I'm going to build from scratch, eh?  
  
[![](assets/175-8.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z%5Ft1j6K0s7k/U5S6mS%5FlilI/AAAAAAABXm0/QZqa9ZizpA4/s1600/%23176+-+Media+Server.PNG)

  
**Set up a Home Media Server & combined digital library** \- I should be able to see my own content on all my stuff.  
  
Melissa and I have developed a respectable collection of photos, music, and videos. The problem is that those things exist in little silos on our computers. I can access her music. She can't access my photos. Neither of us can watch the dumb videos I make on our TV (unless we go through YouTube). I have digital copies of my entire DVD collection that do me no good. I want to set up a Home Media Server - likely using PLEX. I want to create higher-quality digital copies of my physical media. I want to buy all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Blu-Ray and digitize it. I'm not sure which type of implementation I'd like to pursue - Network Attached Storage or just running it off a computer. Maybe I'll run it off on that Linux computer I'm building from scratch to use for Android Development?  
  
[![](assets/175-9.gif)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XLhjnCXKOpY/U5TEsWQcrMI/AAAAAAABXuA/AAfGBgAJZQE/s1600/%23176+-+Music.gif)
  
  
**Learn to Music** \- I fully anticipate the .gif above will embarrass my wife.  
  
I am married to a Music Teacher/Therapist. My wife can play instruments I've never even seen before, my father-in-law plays in a band from time to time, and I can't keep a steady beat to save my life. I want to learn how to play enough music to actually enjoy my time with a guitar/piano/whatever. I'd _love_ to be able to record music with Melissa someday. Right now, I'd be about as useful as a goat in a recording studio. Maybe I'll be able to record and mix music on that Linux computer I'm building from scratch to use for Android Development and Home Media Serving?

Motto: Bro, do You Even Lift? (or run? or stretch?)

  
I've been working my new job position for a few months now. I see parts of it creeping into my regular life. I've begun thinking about some things in terms of "deliverables" and begun using terms like "baselining". Today's post was written to satisfy an idea I had earlier today. Also, the Top 5 is kind of interesting.

  
Melissa and I were talking about our medium-to-long term plans and goals. We touched on our 3-5 year plan. Nothing set in stone, but we've introduced each other to our desires and expectations. One of the things we agreed on was the a continuation of the _"healthy"_ focus we've had. In fact, we want to become even _more_ health-conscious. I told her that, even though I look a little better than I used to, I don't really _feel_ any better. I don't feel "fit". I wouldn't feel "fit" until...

  
Then I trailed off. 

  
Then I made this face:

  
[![](assets/186-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h8lcnkphug8/U83mEbqY8-I/AAAAAAABaKM/6NSQQv5NynQ/s1600/%23186+-+Face.jpg)

  
What is my definition of "fit"? I mean, what does that even mean? How would I know if I were there?

  
Looking up "fitness baseline testing" I've found some of the following:

  
* Pushup/pullup tests - as many as possible
* One-rep max for press, bench, squat, and deadlift - doing 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x your body weight, respectively.
* 1, 2, 3 mile run - 5, 12, and 19 minutes seem like common baselines
* CrossFit Baseline WOD - Row 500 M, 40 air squats, 30 sit ups, 20 pushups, 10 pullups for time

I found most of those things across a few different sources. There were a few more things, but it boiled down to the above + cruft. That's what other people tend to think a "fit" person could do.
  
  
I think it's fair to say that "Fit" is **subjective** and **ever-changing**. I've told my buddies that I want to be able to lift heavy things, run far distances, jump with agility, and still be able to touch my toes. My definition of fit is different from yours, theirs, or anyone else's - because I'm the one applying it.  
  
So, what should I be able to do before I consider myself "fit"?  
  
Here's what I'll consider a "rough draft" list:  
  
* Run 1 mile in 6 minutes
* Run 3 miles in 20 minutes
* Hold a plank for 2 minutes
* Do 50 pushups in a set
* Do 15 pullups in a set
* Press 75% my bodyweight
* Bench my bodyweight
* Squat 150% my bodyweight
* Deadlift 175% my bodyweight
* Mastery over some of the more common-yet-difficult yoga poses - crane, half moon, twisted half moon, warrior 3, tree, standing splits
  
Spoiler: I can't do all of those things. I don't think I can do _any_ of those things right now. And what's sad is I already adjusted all those goals downward to set myself up for actual success.  

  
Over this coming week I think I'm going to try to test myself with all of the above goals to establish a fitness baseline. Pending follow through, results will show up here in the form of a new post in about 6 days.

  
These aren't my long-term goals. Eventually, I'd like to be in the "1000 pound club" (combined bench, squat, deadlift total of over 1/2 ton)... but I've got several years worth of work to do, I think, before I could get to that. 

  
The Top 5 comes from a new summary view I added to my Life Tracker: Diet by day of the week. It's also the view that lets me see what my high scores are. High score calories: 4770 in a day. High score protein: 266 grams. High score on fats: 208 grams. High score on carbs: 583 grams. None of those figures came from the same day as any other.

  
Top 5: Days of the Week in which I Eat the Most

5\. Friday - 2582 cals on average (stdev = 684 cals)  
4\. Sunday - 2582 cals on average (stdev = 671 cals)  
3\. Saturday - 2710 cals on average (stdev = 584 cals)  
2\. Thursday - 2754 cals on average (stdev = 691 cals, highest standard deviation)  
1\. Tuesday - 2762 cals on average (stdev = 562 cals, lowest standard deviation)... the most interesting one. Why do I eat so much, so consistently on Tuesday?

Motto: Google Fit, Not Quite Fit for Duty (HEADLINES, SON)

  
This entire update is about Google fit. If you don't care, I suggest you skip it.  
  
[![](assets/217-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-naAn4sioyaI/VFrrDXPDijI/AAAAAAABgfI/vKSI1BR2zbI/s1600/Screenshot%5F2014-11-05-21-20-24.png)

  
I love Google Fit. It sits in the crux of things I really like. Seriously, if you threw some sort of Marvel superhero in there somehow I might explode. It shows amazing potential, but I think Google is doing a horrible job with the release.  
  
Google Fit is an aggregation platform/app for all of the health & fitness data from the various diet, workout, sleep apps available on the Play Store. It will shine when it aggregates all of that data.  
  
However.  
  
Right now, this is all you can get to integrate with Google Fit:  
  
* Strava (Beta) - a running/bicycling app
* MayMyRun - a running/bicycling app
* Runtastic - a running app
* Runkeeper - a running app

That's it... I think.

  
I say "I think" because there is NO WAY TO SEARCH FOR APPS INTEGRATED WITH GOOGLE FIT. They have NOT aggregated them in the Google Fit app. They have NOT aggregated them in the Google Play store. There is NO WAY to know what apps are available to use for data gathering. I found those four apps after looking online, looking at the developer site, and searching the Play Store for half an hour. I'm not happy about that. The killer app of Google Fit will be the integration... so why are you making it so difficult to find apps that play nicely? Even if there really is only 4 (which I doubt), SHOW ME THOSE FOUR! If I search for "Google Fit" on the Play Store, there are zero ZERO **ZERO** apps in the first 50 apps that integrate with Google Fit.

  
[![](assets/217-2.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i%5FOd8K7KT7A/VFrp0oUQWOI/AAAAAAABge4/H196A7cJ62Q/s1600/Screenshot%5F2014-11-05-17-48-47.png)

  
Seriously.

  
You're giving anyone who's not a fanatic Googler or a fanatic quantified-self advocate reason to look at the app, decide it's only a glorified pedometer app, and dismiss it. 

  
Also - the only apps I can find so far are 4 **runnings** apps. Where's the diet trackers? Where's the sleep trackers? Where's the weightlifting, interval training, and/or anything other than "steady state cardio" apps? What about some sort of happiness/mood/mental well being app? What about glucose, blood pressure, or other type trackers?

  
The app _itself_ also has room for some obvious improvements. What's the deal with the blue graphs here?

  
[![](assets/217-3.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fwrlGxgOsbU/VFrpTgaDGDI/AAAAAAABgew/KzevKkZMmlI/s1600/Screenshot%5F2014-11-05-21-21-02.png)

  
Those blue graphs are so **short**. The grey box showing me the average and range for each day is so short, it can't even display the text contained therein. There is no semblance of data resolution here. Why have a graph if you can't get information out of it?

  
Also, here's a _specific_ complaint. That grey box says my average heart rate was **114** beats per minute. If that were true, I'd be in a serious pickle. My resting heart rate is somewhere around 65 in actuality. My watch, which measures my heart rate every 5 minutes, does **NOT** report that data into Google Fit. Instead, it only reports instances where I _manually_ instigate a heart rate reading... which I generally only think to do when my heart rate is elevated for some reason. 

  
Google, I see SO MUCH POTENTIAL HERE ----- but I am disappoint.

  
On the plus side - integration with the "LifeSum" dietary tracker is coming... and that app is _beautiful_. Seriously. Look at this app:

  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6rd3MIsRzY0/VFrx-PtlSiI/AAAAAAABgf0/r4hRjXqdELw/s1600/14%2B-%2B1)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6rd3MIsRzY0/VFrx-PtlSiI/AAAAAAABgf0/r4hRjXqdELw/s1600/14%2B-%2B1)

  
Seriously. That's gorgeous.

  
Top 5: Things that Need to Happen to Achieve Google Fit Zen

5\. A greater number of apps to choose from for integration.  
4\. A greater variety of apps to choose from for integration. Heart rate. Diet. Weightlifting. Really ANY metric beyond some sort of step-based thing.  
3\. Integration with fitness _devices_. Even my Android Wear watch doesn't really do what I want.  
2\. Better data views.  
1\. A way to FIND all of these things. Why are they hiding this stuff?!? It's madness!?

Melissa and I spending lots of time at the pool.  
  
All of those are contributing factors to the lack of updates; but I think the biggest thing that's affecting\* my usual "Aaron projects" is the learning I'm doing on Udacity. It's made me realize that my projects could all be done in better ways. This makes me want to redo the projects again. Knowing that I'll redo them makes me less compelled to continue the effort of regular maintenance. Why write a lot if I anticipate changing the Blog over to my own website? Why do the Life Tracker if its format will soon change drastically? It's a stupid, artificial change that has had a measurable impact on my rate of productivity... and that's an effect\* I was not expecting.  
  
\*After 10+ minutes of Googling & reading, I'm 90% sure I used the right form of affect/effect in these two spots.  
  
The term "First World Problems" gained popularity around 4 years ago. It is typically used to denote trivial issues that really only effect privileged people (e.g. "My book ran out of batteries"). Today I thought about another, more real but less trivial issue that effects only those with with good means: destructive consumerism.  
  
I don't want to get super serious on this topic. The Column is not a place where I like to dump serious stuff. It strikes me, though, that the majority of the non-poor will never fully take advantage of the opportunities that are already available to them. When you get something new it comes with a certain novelty. After a bit, the novelty wears off. Once you've used up a certain percentage of the "goodness" that you can wring out of whatever toy you got, you just move onto the next one. You never really explore EVERY possibility because you didn't have to. I was seriously looking at an Android TV device the other day. A toy which accomplishes so little beyond what my current stuff already does, that you'd have to include tons of qualifiers like "slightly" or "technically" while listing them out. My Playstation is capable of doing so much more than I use it for. The Chromecast & my computer are capable of ridiculously cool things that I haven't been forced to explore. There is a bookshelf full of books next to our couch. I've read exactly 2 of them. I probably should, but I don't.  
  
Ostensibly, you already own everything you truly NEED to own.  
  
Speaking of First World Problems - plugging USB ports in the wrong way is a classic. Soon, that will be a thing of the past. USB-C is coming and it's going to be great.

  
Top 5: **Reasons I'm Looking Forward to the Coming USB-C Standard**  
5\. It will replace USB, HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, Firewire, Thunderbolt, Ethernet, and power cables.  
4\. It will replace your phone, tablet, laptop, and monitor's various cables.  
3\. When you have a single connector/cable to handle all of the above, your Laptop can suddenly have 4 USB ports instead of 2 USB ports, an HDMI port, and a port for power. The 2 USB-C cables in your bag can plug your laptop into the wall & your phone into your laptop. Or your phone into the wall & your laptop into a external monitor. Or your phone to an external hard drive and your laptop into your external battery pack.  
2\. The connector is completely reversible. You'll no longer plug things in the wrong way - or grab the wrong end of the cable. No matter how you grab it, it will work.  
1\. It's simple. It's clean. It will make the idea of using different cable standards for different things seem archaic in as few as 5 years. Kids won't understand that we used to have to care about WHICH cable we got. To them, plugging stuff in will be as simple as putting one of the wires from the drawer between the two things. That's it.

Motto: Think Outside the Box, but Color Inside the Lines  
  
The title of this post is not a reference to the Super Bowl. I didn't watch it. I have heard how it went, but I was too busy learning how to ski and spending the better part of my 3 hours on the slope flat on my back. The title of this post is a reference to the progress my aforementioned back has made since the end of January. It was really bugging me, as I mentioned in my previous post. In that post I didn't convey my real thoughts about how chronic pain sucks and how it affects you very well. It's the worst. It's a constant reminder that your body is limited, your time here is limited, the experiences you will have on this earth are limited by both of those factors. Rather than continue down that depressing path, I'll just say that I'm back to feeling good again! Anti-inflammatories work like a charm. As much as I hate relying on a prescription to be normal - I'd rather be on one and feeling normal than off one and gimping all over the place.  
  
Is "gimp" an offensive term in 2017?  
  
Anyway, my "Life Tracker" metrics have made MASSIVE improvements since my back started feeling better. I have already worked out more in February than I did in all of January. My macro ratios are back on track. Productivity is up. Everything has been going really well. It felt good enough to ski the other day. My back held up pretty well considering I spent 2 of the 3 hours we were out on the slope laying flat on it. Sometimes being 6'9" is hard.

I found out something pretty cool just now. Two of my drawings from my previous post show up in searches on Google Photos I make for the people depicted in the drawing. That is to say - I did a good enough job that Google facial recognition software realized who I was drawing.

I have been hard at work during this forced shut-in. Every minute I'm not with my wife and son, nor sleeping, nor eating, nor practicing guitar, nor working from home, nor doing standard chores[^one], I have been building a new system of permanent notes. 

This post is 100% about that. So bail out now if you're not interested.

# Why

It's been my ambition to never let what's important to me fall by the wayside. In a coincidence of events, one of those things I've deemed important *also* helps me arm myself with the tools and techniques to handle all the other things: **managing my knowledge**. 

When I graduated college I realized if I wasn't careful I would have already achieved my maximum level of knowledge. I was fresh off classes like *Partial Differential Equations* and *Electromagnetic Interference*. I didn't want to reach 45 and realize I was dumber than I was at 25. I set out to review & summarize everything I ever learned into a sort of pseudo study guide for every class ever. As I wrote about in [my previous post](https://aarongilly.com/389), I ultimately gave up on the idea (after doing a 50+ page outline, in fairness to myself).

![[390-1.png]]

Recently I've been reading a lot of books (again, wholly thanks to [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), [Axis 360](http://axis360.site.baker-taylor.com/), & [RbDigital](https://rbdigital.com/), and taking lots of notes. Each book had its own little summary page. Somewhere in the middle of my 24th book summary, I realized the the notes I was writing for *this* book that were incredibly similar to notes I'd previously written for other books... and that was happening a **lot**.

Enter [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/).[^two] It changed my goal. I didn't want a bunch of independent book summaries - I wanted *smart notes*.

# What

"Smart Notes" is a much less German term for the *Zettelkasten Notetaking Method*. In short, the Smart Notes system consists of a few basic concepts.

1. Atomic Notes - short notes that cover only one idea
2. Unique IDs - all notes are uniquely identified
3. Linked Notes - notes reference other notes by their IDs
4. Basic Tagging - notes are tagged with relevant topics or themes
5. No organizational hierarchy

The end result is a mass of small notes, linked together in a network via their natural relations to one-another... very much like how ideas work in your head. You keep this repository active, and add to it incrementally for the rest of your life. 

For waaay more information, check out the book, footnote 3, or [watch this video](https://vimeo.com/275530205).

# How

First, I gathered all my book summaries. Then, I jotted down a short list of (literally four) online articles that I've found very insightful. After humming and hawwing for literally 3+ months, I decided on an implementation strategy. It's based in Notion.

I am utilizing two linked Databases in Notion: one for **Sources** and one for **Notes**.

## Sources

My sources database contains book summaries, article summaries, names of & links to podcasts, and names of individual people. It does NOT contain "clippings" or any wholesale copy/paste content. This choice was made partially to prevent possible future plagiarization, but moreso because when I *did* have other people's writing in there all my searches for stuff I knew I'd written were returning results written by other people. It made the whole process of rediscovering what I already knew more difficult.

![[390-2.png]]

The sources each have properties for type (book/podcast/article/person), a relevant URL, a status (reading/atomized), a relation property to the Notes database for all the notes that source generated, then a rollup property counting the notes in the relation.

## Notes

My notes database has properties for tags (multiselect), source (Linked database to "Sources"), created (auto date), updated (auto date), a summary, and a "to do" checkbox. I'm not utilizing some sort of "UID" property, because their URL functions that way. Instead my notes are named with a few keywords describing them - such as "Known/Unknown Matrix" or "Naturals vs Strivers". 

![[390-3.png]]

The notes themselves are, thus far, a few paragraphs long each (on average). I utilize callouts, colors, bolding, italicizing, images, @mentions, and "links to page". I have a template that gives me a place to write the note, a horizontal rule, then a H1 header for "Related Notes". Under that header I'll manually create a series of "Link to Page" for any related notes. I also utilize @mention page links in the body of the note when I reference the concepts covered by that note (part of the reason why naming the notes something lexically useful is beneficial).

## A Final Note on How

Here is my [Notes database](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea?v=c957bb0ea6dd42e9a83df8338e11c786) and [Sources](https://www.notion.so/e301531cc1ee4ad7ae537d87f9681116?v=2136c19212174a24956154a130b78b1b) - if you really see how it's working. I intend to leave it open for viewing by anyone interested. I'm the the method isn't [perfect](https://www.notion.so/Perfection-is-Dangerous-ee2d6db59fef4d359e791c72328bbce5). It could be improved upon, but seems to be working well enough for me. I can open & search the entire thing from my phone or any browser. 

I can export the entire database to a .CSV with all my properties and individual markdown files whose links to other notes still function. Both methods of linking, @ links and "Links to Page", produce relative links that I can traverse between in VS Code. Images are stored in a folder per page, and in properly exclamation-mark-linked as you'd expect in Markdown. Those, too, can be traversed via clicking in VS Code (and, presumably, other tools more squarely aimed at creating a Zettelkasten).

# The Result - My Work in Progress

![[390-4.png]]

I finished atomizing all 24 of my book summaries over the course of about 12 days. I read my own summaries, broke them apart into their constituent components, and created Notes for those components. As I went, I linked new Notes to notes I'd already taken. Sometimes I'd go back to a note I'd already taken and add more to it, to cover information from a different source on the same topic. Concepts like how "Routine Frees the Mind" and the benefits of "Being Unavailable" were well-covered by multiple sources.

## The Numbers

These are all going to change *immediately*. This is a living database. Here's a snapshot circa this post.

![[390-6.png]]

I have **270** notes.  
Currently I have **19** categories.  
I've tagged notes 550 times, which means each note has **two** tags on average (not an important stat, but it was free).  

My two highest categories are **philosophy** and **productivity**. I've got >100 notes on both of those. The third highest category, **business** has less than 50. I guess I'm specializing in the philosophy of productivity.

![[390-7.png]]

In that chart, blue = books, orange = articles, and grey is for *other*.

The most-cited (i.e. most impactful?) books I've read are *Essentialism* and *Atomic Habits*. There's a bit of recency bias with *Essentialism* and the 3rd most-cited book *Stillness is the Key*. They are both very good, but also helped out by the fact that I was actively doing this project while reading them.

I wanted to do a network diagram to display how the notes were linked, but I don't really have the means to produce such a diagram without doing an amount of work that, frankly, I'm too tired to do. I'll figure that out someday, then put it on here in whatever post.

In other news - I'm bringing color back to my Top 5s & Quotes.

Motto: I'm Really Proud of the Title of this Post, Too 

  
On the first of this month I wrote about my experiences while on a Paleo diet. I mentioned that I felt better throughout the day. I slept better. I woke up easier. I no longer had any stomach issues. Now that I've been _off_ Paleo for a couple of weeks, I'm surprised at just how BAD it is going back to regular foods. I feel like I'm constantly nauseous or bloated. I am getting headaches. I can't fall asleep as quickly or easily. I don't sleep as well. Basically, things suck.  
  
What I'm saying is this, I'm more impressed with how _bad_ going back to normal food was than how good the diet made me feel. I'm talked with Melissa about this and she largely agrees - Paleo was great. It was also terrible and too restrictive, but going back to normal foods cold turkey has been rough. We have discussed a long-term dietary change. More whole foods, less boxed crap.

  
Speaking of Melissa -   
  
She's great. I generally shy away from writing about her because I always feel awkward when I read other people doing this stuff type of stuff, but sometimes it just needs to be said. She's been killing it lately with planning our wedding AND she's in her first year of teaching. That takes some sort of crazy ability I can only dream of having. I have a great fiance and I'm very happy that someday soon I'll have the honor of calling her my wife.

  
Speaking of dreams -

  
I've been having this recurring daydream for the past several months that I want to share with you:  
  
I put a couple of notebooks and a small Chromebook into my Timbuk2 bag. I sling that over my shoulder, and hop on a bike. I ride that bike to a coffee shop and fill a travel mug. Then I ride to the library. I sit down in the library for several hours over several days over several weeks, working away on a heavy project using my lightweight Chromebook running lightweight applications. I write and I write, and I create something awesome. Something that didn't exist before I sat down. Something I made using only my brain, a very simple computer, some caffeine, and the resources found at my local library.  
  
I want to make that a reality. It's startling how many things I've done lately in the pursuit of this dream. I upgraded Timbuk2 bags\*. I looked into the market of Chromebooks. I mapped out the route and distance to the nearest library to my soon-to-be place of residence. I opened up the long-term academic re-education project that I started 3 years ago, just to see what I'd have to do to get that updated and started again.  
  
You may have noticed the asterisk in the above paragraph. That's because the Timbuk2 bag upgrade isn't probably the upgrade you're thinking of... the one [I wrote about less than 3 weeks ago](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/01/136-chrome-in-all-its-forms.html). Less than 2 weeks after I wrote that Column, Timbuk2 announced and released an updated version of their Classic Messenger bag. It looked awesome and I was upset that I'd just bought the other one, until I realized Amazon has an awesome return policy. Long story short:

The top bag was my original. Melissa now uses that every day for school. The middle bag was the one I got to replace it about 3 weeks ago, it's on the way back to Amazon. The bottom bag is the one I got to replace the middle bag about 3 days ago.   
  
I'm using the bottom bag from now on as both my work bag _and_ my play bag - so it is my _true_ Every Day Carry. So - I got to re-re-re-re-rethink what I want to carry every day.  
  
I know I've written about this ad nauseum - so I'll just show you:

That's what I'm carrying every day.  
  
Two last things -  
  
1\. Bed Bath and Beyond doesn't literally sell beds or baths. I call shenanigans.  
  
2\. Life has been stressful lately. My body aches. My shoulder tried popping out of socket at a basketball game the other day. I'm not sleeping well. See below for why!

  
Top 5: Stressful Things Happening at Once

5\. My Body is Trying to Give Up on Me!  
4\. I'm Moving!  
3\. I'm Switching Job Roles!  
2\. I'm Planning a Wedding!  
1\. My First Real Pet just Died!

# Motto: A Bird in the Hand is Worth Several Hundred in the Bush. Birds are in Bushes All the Time, in Hands much less Often.


**Now we turn to this week in media expansion.**

Right now I'm watching "[This Week in Google](http://twit.tv/twig)" as it's being recorded. I listen to the podcast every week per the suggestion of my sister, Alissa. It's one of the several new ways I find myself killing time. Also on this list: This American Life, audiobooks, and TV On-Demand via Netflix or Hulu. 

That's the future. That's the way things will be. TV is slowly dying with it. [Olivia Wilde wrote an article](http://www.buzzfeed.com/oliviawilde/olivia-wilde-on-video-on-demand) championing Video On Demand on Buzzfeed. [Kevin Spacey talked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc) about the future of media at the Edinburgh TV Festival. If you're killing time, both of those links are worth clicking on (IMHO).

**Now we turn to this week in Life Tracking.**

One of the implicit goals of tracking which of a set of 25 daily tasks I complete was to see how doing one thing effected doing other things. Does completing a workout correspond to better eating? Is writing a Column correlated with not wasting time? 

So I did some spreadsheet work:

![big grid](assets/110-1.png)

The TL;DR of the spreadsheet is that there aren't any major correlations, outside of the "more likely to work while at work" block. In fact, there is almost a suspicious lack of correlation. I expected days including a workout to be more productive across the board. Not so much the case. The only thing that did pan out the way I expected - when I write columns and work on projects I am less likely to check off "Focused Less on Yourself". That makes sense.

For all you nerds out there - the units on that spreadsheet were left intentionally vague. The whole thing is normalized around 100%. Each data point shows the percent change from my usual likelihood of completion.

![comic](assets/110-2.png)

No matter the situation, there is a relevant XKCD. That's internet rule #35.

**Now we turn to this week in cyber security.**

For the longest time I've been one of those people who uses one or two passwords for everything. My small set of passwords were actually fairly strong, but rendered weak by the sheer number of services I used them on. I can tell you all this now because it has finally changed. I have committed to a password management solution and many, long, different passwords. One for each service. Exactly which service am I using? That... is... that's what I'm doing after I post this.

**Now we turn to this week in Linux.**

I pulled out my old computer last night on a whim and tinkered around for a bit. Long story short I completely wiped it clean and installed Linux on it (Ubuntu 12.04, specifically). I'm going to use it in-conjunction with my normal computer to ensure an elegant cross-platform cross-operating system digital playground. All of my documents, pictures, videos, and music I will convert to the most open-source, most generic possible filetypes. I want to have a dynamic mass of tightly controlled yet-open to anywhere file. That's my goal.

**Now we turn to this week in the rest of life.**

Other than that, life has been pretty uneventful as of late. Still not 100% sure on a wedding venue or date. Melissa has transitioned very gracefully into a full-blown working adult (she's a music teacher). She's doing very well and I'm very happy about that. The transitional phase is slowly coming to a close and things are starting to settle down some. Life is good.

Motto: Rambling for Rambling's Sake  
  
Yesterday I bought a brand new 28" 4K Samsung computer monitor.  
  
Today I am writing this Column on it.  
  
Tomorrow I'll be returning it to the store.   
  
I'm disappointed to have to do so... but it's necessary. If I were doing a single-monitor setup & the panel I bought was better quality & my graphics card were better, it would be make for a GREAT experience... however none of those things are true. For more information, check out the Top 5\. For _less_ information... uh... I don't know. I don't think I can do that for you. You've already read it. That's sorta on you.  
  
_Note:_ this Column was written over several days' time. The "day" references are all jacked up.  
  
Speaking of "jacked" - I was confronted the other day with a person who did not understand my usage of the word to convey excitement. "I'm jacked!" was met with "what do your muscles have to do with Deadpool?". Upon explaining that "jacked" can also mean "excited", I was met with skepticism. When asking around about people's perception of the definition, I met a person who completely agreed with me and another person who had an even _further_ reduced scope of definitions. To her, "jacked" was only a word that could be used in reference to vehicles being jacked up.  
  
I think that's jacked up.  
  
Deadpool was great.  
  
The new Hitman game has a beta out right now. It's alright. I'm pretty much done with Fallout 4\. I mean that both like "I've had enough" and "I think I've done all there is to do". Mostly, I'm really tired of writing "Fallout 4" in the Life Tracker's "what did you do today?" section. The Second-a-Day video has at _least_ a half dozen seconds that are just "here's me playing Fallout 4". I'm not happy with that fact.  
  
This Column has used a _ton_ of quotation marks.  
  
Okay - something I've been meaning to write about: I predict the future of consumer tech is augmented reality.  
  
We are nowhere near where we need to be before this can become reality, but this is what I'm predicting:  
  
Phones, computers, smartwatches, televisions - all of these things have screens. Particularly in the case of phones and smart wearables, we carry around little screens with us everywhere. They are bright, limited in size and scope, and overall somewhat limited. I think that someday we will develop some sort of Google Glass-like wearable that removes the need to carry around any other personal electronics. The interface will just appear in front of you. Interacting with it will be done accomplished via some sort of neural link.   
  
I could write a lot more about that, but I'm boring myself over here. Please accept this cat gif as my apology.  
  
[![](assets/281-1.gif)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jOLweY%5FrJS0/Vsn3yNy5YNI/AAAAAAACGRk/hQZkQ-DFfnM/s1600/Cat%2BNeeds%2BHelp.gif)
  
  
Top 5: Reasons I'm Returning My New 28" 4K Monitor  
5\. I want to keep my old 1080p monitor around. Running dual monitors with a difference in resolution that's _that_ stark is a bit rough.  
4\. Despite some genuinely impressive things Microsoft has done with Windows 10 to handle a dual-display setup (DPI scaling on a per-monitor basis and other such things), the programs I use don't necessarily handle that transition well. My video editing program's interface is _tiny_.  
3\. Give all the other reasons around this one - I could get a _cheaper_ monitor that suited my needs better.  
2\. Compared to my 5+ year old 1080p Samsung monitor, the new one appears **washed out.** The TN panel on the new one really doesn't cut it when it comes to color saturation.  
1\. Despite my initial belief, my GTX 750 TI OC graphics card does not appear to even have the necessary plugs to run a 4K monitor at 60Hz. I wasn't expecting to run 4K games, but I was expecting to at least be able to roll my mouse across the desktop without getting motion sick (this literally happened last night). Turns out 30Hz is the biggest deal-breaker of them all.

Motto: 7719836421125

  
Don't bother trying to decipher the motto. It's from Rick and Morty. Someone on the internet may stumble across the post trying to figure out if those numbers mean anything. If they do mean something, I don't know. I just wanted to waste a few seconds of this hypothetical person's time.

  
And I guess waste your time reading it. I'm a jerk.

  
I might be repeating myself with this next bit, but I'm not finding first time I wrote about it, if it exists... and let's be honest I repeat myself on here every time I write.

  
It's sort of a bummer that I have no real terrible habits.

  
I don't smoke.

I don't drink to excess.

I don't do drugs.

_Meanwhile..._

I **do** exercise.

I **do** use my brain.

  
I've heard so many stories about people who "finally quit smoking, quit drinking, and started exercising - and it feels _fantastic_". Basically I live that life every day. We are playing with different baselines & I feel like it's sometimes difficult to remember to appreciate the fact that I never smoked... or that I have a healthy relationship with food. It's like if you grow up with a mom who's a fantastic cook, but you don't realized or appreciate how fantastic the white chili was your whole life.

  
It doesn't feel to me like there's some obvious, glaring thing I could do that could make my life just so much better. I feel like I'm already operating near my life's "idyllic groove" and all the 30 Day Challenges, the self-improvement projects, and the analysis of life data are me just playing with the margins. It's hard to improve your score if you're already getting an A.

  
I guess I'll just continue enjoying my white chili and stop complaining that my life is good.

  
Speaking of complaining about things being good:

  
Having a bunch of stuff means you have to _maintain_ a bunch of stuff. This is the plight of the first world, upper-ish-depends-on-how-you-define-it-middle-class American family. 

  
I have 3 sinks. I have to do sink maintenance 3 times as often as someone with one sink. 

  
I have two crock pots. Two weed eaters. A seed spreader for some reason. A lawn mower for a lawn I don't even like owning. I can see 3 lamps from where I'm sitting and I can think of where another 5 are without trouble. I have kitchen stuff that I use once every 6 months then think to myself "man I should use this every _week"_ before putting it back in the cabinet and forgetting it exists for many months.

  
I own too much stuff. You buy things because you think they are going to be useful, or helpful, or make you happy - and some of the stuff genuinely accomplishes that - but 80 to 90% of it falls short... or falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. If I were hard-pressed, I could take 13 photos of myself on different devices simultaneously. That's a _real_ number. I just counted.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This was a pre-existing photo collage that illustrates less than 1/3rd of what I was talking about.                                                                                                                                                                  |

I wish I knew in advance how I'd come to regard a purchase 2 months after having made it. It's not something I've gotten better at - and I'm not saying I have a problem with holding onto money. I'm saying that I don't know why I own literally 5 lunchboxes - and I feel like I didn't learn anything from the experience because my 5th lunchbox is something I'm genuinely happy about every day. It's awesome... and it's the 5th iteration of a thing most people buy one of and call it good. What's the lesson from that? Know exactly what you want before you buy anything?

  
Actually that's probably the lesson. Damn.

  
**February's 30 Day Challenge:**

Updated personal inventory.

  
This Top 5 solidifies my nerd cred for this Column. I wish I put more time & thought into it, cause I know there are better things to write I"m just not thinking of right now.

  
Top 5: Things I Wish Microsoft Would Fix about Excel

5\. Phantom links between workbooks that no longer exist. If I click "Existing Connections" and see nothing after having just closed your "hey you have existing connections" dialog box, I get annoyed.  
4\. Array formulas should not be called using the weird Ctrl+Shift+Enter method. I imagine there's some technical reason for this - but why can't I just write "=array(...)" around my formulas so they aren't so prone to people breaking them if I dont' lock them.  
3\. I don't specifically know what causes this - but I've seen multiple workbooks where there's phantom data causing the file size to explode and the scroll bar to wig out. It's almost always fixable, but again you shouldn't have to be a pro to fix the scrollbar.   
2\. Vlookup should be updated to fix its limitations - or it should just autocomplete to an equivalent Index+Match function. Vlookup sucks.  
1\. Fix your number formatting. Don't treat a number in a contiguous range of pasted data as a number if the rest of the data are alphanumeric strings. If I tell you to switch a range from numbers to strings, apply that formatting change immediately to whole range. You've set up a trap that Excel novices fall into, get frustrated with, and decide they suck at using your program.

Motto: Well That's Disappointing

  
In 2014, when Google announced the Nexus 6 that was a huge personal disappointment, they announced a few other things that I passed on. My car isn't running "Android Auto" and my television isn't running Android TV... any more.  
  
I had read reviews for the NVIDIA SHIELD console (later rebranded as NVIDIA SHIELD TV, which seems like it's just screaming itself at you) for the past 5 months. It had been on my Amazon wish list since the first week it was available. On a lark, I decided to swing by the local Micro Center (electronics store) to see if they had one in stock. To my surprise/delight, they had exactly one in stock. I picked it up and took it home, filled with glee. I plugged it in, booted it up, logged in, and started playing around.  
  
Then the problems started.  
  
Nothing huge. Just... a bunch of little things. The Chromecast functionality was spotty. The audio cut out from time to time. The applications available on the Google Play Store were limited. I expected **all** of the Android Apps I know and love to be available; but instead there was only the "Android TV" apps. There are far fewer of those. I was able to find a Super Nintendo Emulator, but not an N64 emulator like I hoped. I looked for Android TV games, but literally reached the end of the sum-total list of all games available on the platform. Not much there. Nothing at all I was interested in, lots of "Freemium" games. Other things I wasn't interested in.  
  
The game _streaming_ feature worked well. I was able to play Hitman from my computer on my television in the living room. That was the highlight of my experience with the device. Battlefield 4 wasn't really doable. The small amount of lag induced by the stream killed any chance I had at being competitive. Also, keyboard + mouse >>> gamepads for first-person shooters.  
  
SO, there I was. With a $200 device that functioned slightly worse than the $35 Chromecast that had been there before, and didn't have much value-add (aside from being able to play _local_ videogames from my PC on the television)... It just didn't justify the cost.  
  
So I returned it. No sweat. Micro Center is great.  
  
While I was there - I decided to pick up a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry%5FPi). It's a $35 barebones computer-on-a-board. When I say "barebones", I really mean barebones:  
  
[![](assets/272-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e94O5ts7Aio/VjT0ha6jGmI/AAAAAAACAKI/s5zvWYd2OY0/s1600/%2523262%2B-%2BRaspberry%2BPi.jpg)

  
That picture is from [their Amazon page](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Project-Board/dp/B00T2U7R7I/ref=sr%5F1%5F2?ie=UTF8&qid=1446310831&sr=8-2&keywords=Raspberry+Pi). I suggest picking one up from a store, though. Two dollars cheaper there. Anyway, that's a whole computer. A $35 computer that you can do TONS of stuff with. I am very interested in exploring what I can build.  
  
I want to start putting my degree to use... in addition to the learning I've done since that time.  
  
Some day, I'm going to have a shop/gym/pool room. That's going to be sweet.

Motto: This Column was Meant to be about Many Topics  
  
I have been thinking some about how stupid our conventions are for times and dates. I wonder if I could come up with something better. This Column is basically a thought experiment, as it progresses.  
  
The year is (roughly) 365 and 1/4 days long. We break that up into 52 weeks, each 7 days long.   
  
52 x 7 = 364  
  
So inherently we've got a flaw there.   
  
The prime factorization of 365 is 73 x 5\. So we COULD do 73 weeks, each 5 days long. Of course, then our structure for "weekday" and "weekend" would be all messed up. People would either have to work 4 days a week _(8.6% more than a standard work week now)_ or 3 days a week _(11.4% less)_. Also any sort of social structure that's set up to operate "every other day" would have a weird time dealing with weekends.  
**BUT!** A year isn't 5 x 73 days long, either. It's more like 5 x 73 + 0.2422 days long.  
  
So, no set number of days would make a year whole without having to fudge around with concepts like "Leap Years". So maybe we could just embrace that concept, and give ourselves a dedicated _weird_ "Leap" portion of the year each year, to allow ourselves to have something that makes more sense for the rest of the year.  
  
**Date proposal:**  
* 6 days a week
* 5 weeks a month
* 12 months a year
* The remaining 5.2422 days aren't in a month - they are called "Leap week", which fluctuates between 5 and 6 days every 4-ish years and occurs at the end of the yearly cycle
  
This keeps our day-to-day in the realm of base 12, which we use for time. It also keeps us in the realm of our currently-existing time-frames. Weeks and months would be roughly the same length they already are. Benefits are - now each month begins on a Monday, it's possible to do "every other day" or "every 3rd day"-type recurring events and maintain days of the week. It makes date math much easier, provided you're not going over Leap week at the end of the year.  
  
In terms of _time_... I have fewer complaints. See the Top 5 for a few of them. But if I could change something, wouldn't it be nice if we just kept base 24? 24 hours a day, 24 minutes an hour 24 seconds a minute? Each second would be equal to 6 1/4 seconds in our current timing scheme. You could then enact thirds, which would be about 1/4 of our regular seconds.  
  
Fun fact, if you didn't already know "Seconds" are named "seconds" because they are the second division of the hour by 60\. Hence me mentioning thirds above.  
  
Alright, rather than talk about anything else with this - here's a picture to go out on of the calendar I made that fixes all the world's problems:

Top 5: Time and Date Conventions I Wish We Could Change  
5\. Each day of the week & each month of the year should start with a different, unique letter.  
4\. AM and PM should die, all time should be military time. 6AM and 6PM have nothing in common.  
3\. Dates & times should be written in a standard format; preferably something that starts general then gets specific - e.g. right now = "2019.02.24|09:51"  
2\. We should redo the structure of the year. 52 weeks, 12 months, each month has between 28 and 31 days in it. Each week is 7 days. Each day is made of 24 hours, each of which is divided into 60 seconds. Our date & time structure is reminiscent of Harry Potter money.  
1\. Daylight saving time shouldn't exist

Motto: This Turned Out Longer than I Expected

  
Conventions that make no sense bug me.

  
10 pm

11 **pm**

**12 am**

**1** am

2 am

  
Why does am/pm switch over before the numbers switch over? Why not simultaneously? Why do we _start_ the day with an hour named "12", then go to 1? I'll tell you why. It's because people are dumb, and dumb people wouldn't understand a "0" hour. 

  
Here's another, very confusing convention:  
  
**2/25/2015**  
  
It's the 25th of February in the year 2015.  
  
Why do we go (medium length), (short) (long)? That makes no sense. You can't sort by year. It's hard to parse out the _day_ on which something happens. Why is it not 25/2/2015? Or, better yet, 2015/2/25?  
  
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a convention for date and time:  
  
**2015-02-25 T21:00-06**  
  
2015, February 25th, at 9pm, 6 hours behind UTC. It's a perfectly self-contained, absolute time reference. Why can't we use this? It's sortable. It's easily understood. It's makes _sense_ (except for the "T", which seems worthless).  
  
Add on GPS coordinates and you have an absolute date, time, and location for whatever you're doing in one line. That's so much easier than saying the event is "on March 13th at 6pm, in the Jose Peppers on Johnson Avenue in Mission, KS." It removes all ambiguity, wasted "filler" words. Why couldn't we just say:  
  
"Meet me 2015-03-12.15:00:00@38.9717N,95.2353W. Bring an umbrella and fresh underwear."  
  
Zero uncertainty.  
  
And now for a couple of other things before I sign off:  
  
**First - I made Battlefield highlight video for February**   
  
(again, which I expect nobody will be interested in).  
  
  
**Second - the sad state of Android phones**  
  
Today is the start of Mobile World Congress, one of the two biggest tech shows that happen each year. Today's announcements include the next HTC One and the next Samsung Galaxy flagship phones. Given that my Nexus 5 is actively trying to die on me, I had a vested interest in how this would all play out.  
  
The HTC One leaks looked really good:  
  
[![](assets/233-1.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0%5FJb4oZExTw/VPNR9L7cuuI/AAAAAAABpJo/HQ6pmQJxiSQ/s1600/%23233%2B-%2BHTC%2BOne%2BM9%2BGood.png)

  
Two models - one with a finger print scanner and one without.  
  
The HTC One reality, however, looks like this:  
  
[![](assets/233-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w5XtqolRenY/VPNTCRNJXsI/AAAAAAABpJw/RXiyKjEmrns/s1600/%23233%2B-%2BHTC%2BOne%2BM9%2BBad.png)

  
Two models - neither with a finger print scanner, both with the disappointing "HTC" black bar between the screen and the bottom speaker.  
  
Only, **there isn't two models**. That's the HTC One M8 _(last year's phone)_ next to an HTC One M9 _(this year's phone)_. Can you tell me which one is the new one?  
  
Don't get me wrong, the HTC One design was pretty stellar. There wasn't much room for improvement, aside from the obvious "HTC" bar and the famously ~~poor~~ unique camera. The M9 does not remove the HTC bar and gives a new camera whose performance is being rated in the initial reviews as "mediocre".  
  
Samsung is Samsung. Their new phone looks better than their old ones, but that might just be because the bar was set ridiculously low. They have moved away from "plasticy pieces of junk" and towards "super angular, metallic pieces of junk".  
  
That's maybe too harsh. They are actually mid-announcement as we speak. The problem I have with Samsung goes beyond the plastic, though. It's their need to recreate their own version of every core Google service. There's the Samsung browser and chrome, the Samsung calendar and Google calendar, the Samsung mail client and Gmail, and the list goes on. I can't stand having stuff on my phone that I don't use. I can't stand junkware.  
  
Unless I hear Samsung has a total change of heart, does a 180 and starts behaving like Motorola, I'm never buying another Samsung phone/tablet again.  
  
So then, I've got a failing Nexus 5 and my "most likely candidate" to supersede it just stumbled out of the gate. I've already shown the HTC One - which I'm not getting. I've already talked about Samsung - which I'm not getting. I wish I could say something about Sony, but they signed a deal with the devil and are not available on any US carrier with respectable coverage in this area. Where does that leave me? What are my options?

**The Moto X (2014)**  
  
This was the strongest contender right out of the gate. I like my Moto 360, so a phone by Motorola would surely be just as appealing.  
  
Pros:  
  
* I like the design
* Motorola has some nifty add-ins on top of stock Android
* Other than that, Motorola doesn't really mess with the zen that is stock Android
* Updates from Motorola are really very fast
* It's a fairly cheap off-contract option
Cons:  
  
* The 2014 Moto X and my Nexus 5 have virtually identical specs
* The Moto X doesn't have wireless charging, which I've invested in pretty heavily and used almost exclusively
* Why pay for a lateral move?

**Nexus 6**  
  
The logical successor to the Nexus 5\. I like my Nexus 5, so its big brother would surely be just as appealing.  
  
Pros:  
  
* It's a Nexus - first in line for updates and an 100% zen-mode stock Android experience
* It's a solid spec-bump over my current phone
* It DOES have wireless charging, unlike the Moto X which it is similar to
Cons:  
  
* It's a 6 inch screen
* Its screen is 6 inches
* Its closer to the size of a Nexus 7 than it is my Nexus 5
* The screen is huge
* The screens resolution is 1440p - way WAY more than could possibly be considered "necessary" for a phone. If someone tells you "you really need 1440p to get crisp images" - they are lying. The 1440p trend is a stupid spec war that stopped being beneficial to the user with the advent of full 1080p screens (even 720p was fine, really). Anything beyond 1080p is a waste of precious phone resources (both battery and processing power). This bullet alone is actually more troubling than the physical size of the screen.

**LG G3**  
  
I didn't really consider it, but it's about the only other option out there.  
  
Pros:  
  
* That screen/bezel ratio is phenomenal
* The specs are a solid bump

Cons:

* The screen on this is _also_ 1440p, which I again will refuse to put money toward
* LG is becoming more and more like Samsung with their bloatware
* "Meh"

  
So... what's left?  

[![](assets/233-6.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vrfYsegVzCc/VPNfp1o2NdI/AAAAAAABpLE/FeYUenKCFf8/s1600/%23233%2B-%2BiPhones.jpg)

  
**The iPhone 6 (plus?)**  
  
Honestly, probably the best option there is left.  
  
Pros:  
  
* Probably the best phone camera there is
* The actual phone is quite pretty
* Compatibility with my wife's tech setup

Cons:

* My Moto 360 is completely incompatible
* As is my wireless charging stations
* ...and my NFC tags
* ...and all of the Android apps/content I've ever paid for (quite a bit)
* I would then be a Google-guy who uses an iPhone and owns a Microsoft desktop... an intermixing technological ecosystems is by far and away the least appealing idea I can think of. If I got an iPhone, it would be the start of a long-road of full-blown Apple replacements to my tech setup... most of which is very new and not worth replacing for years to come.

You know the situation is bad when I start barking up that tree (not the "Apple" tree, but the "reset everything" tree).  
  
Top 5: Most Likely Outcomes of All This

5\. I quit owning a phone and retire into the woods to live the lift of the yeti.  
4\. I deal with the disappointing HTC One release and buy it anyways.  
3\. I buy a Moto X (2014).  
2\. I buy an iPhone 6 (or 6 plus) and begin a massive ecosystem shift with a terrible hodge-podge of products by the three big manufacturers.  
1\. I put up with my Nexus 5 until it full-blown dies, then I switch back to the Nexus 4 until something decent comes out.

Motto: Keep It Simple, Stupid

  
I suck at what I'm about to write about.

  
An overarching theme for most of my posts lately (and because my writing so closely relates to my thinking, an overarching theme of most of my thinking lately), is how perfection is **truly** unattainable. Not only personal perfection/perfection of the self, but the perfect tool, the perfect photo, the perfect _anything._ None if it doesn't really exists... but nearly everything I deal with on a day-to-day basis is **good enough**. I need to learn to live with good enough (in moderation).

  
_Example given:_

I love containers. It's kind of an embarrassing or stupid thing to even admit; but I love them. I love how they organize the things we need and how they make those things easier to move around. 

I love backpacks and messenger bags. 

I love waterbottles and lunchboxes. 

To stick with one example for the sake of argument, let's look at containers meant for drinking out of - I'll loosely call them **waterbottles**. 

  
I own a _lot_. They generally fall into a few different types.

  
**Large, uninsulated Nalgene bottle**

They hold a lot. They are dishwashable. They can be stored in the refrigerator to insure you've always got cold water. They are tough as nails.

_...but..._

They don't maintain temperature. They sweat a lot. They don't really fit _in_ anything. They are heavy when they're full. They can't be used for hot liquids.

  
**Small, insulated Hydroflask**

They are small enough to fit anywhere. They don't sweat. They are very portable. They maintain temperature. They aren't terribly heavy when full.

_...but..._

They constantly need refilled. They are a bit of a pain to drink out of unless you get a fancy lid. They aren't dishwasher safe and therefore difficult to clean. Also they hold so little that if you _do_ put something in them that requires you to clean them out afterwards you're getting a full amount of hassle for a partial amount of benefit. They are prone to dings.

  
**Large, insulated Hydroflask**

They hold a lot. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature. 

_...but..._

They are a bit of a pain to drink out of unless you get a fancy lid. They aren't dishwasher safe. They don't fit most places & are heavy. They are prone to dings.

  
**Large, insulated tumbler**

They hold a lot. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature. They are easy to drink out of. They fit in nearly all cup holders.  

_...but..._

They aren't dishwasher safe. Their lids aren't water-tight, therefore they can't be packed away and forgotten about.

  
**Tervis insulated tumblers**

They come in two sizes. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature. They are easy to drink out of. They fit in nearly all cup holders. They are dishwasher safe.  

_...but..._

Even their big size doesn't hold all that much. Their lids aren't water-tight, therefore they can't be packed away and forgotten about. Some how I manage to always dribble or spill a bit of whatever I'm drinking.

  
**Small, uninsulated Blender Bottle**

The blender ball makes protein drinks easy. They usually fit in most cup holders. Their lids are usually safe enough to not worry about leaks.  

_...but..._

They don't maintain temperature. They are annoying to clean. They generally are pretty small. They make a rattling sound if they're empty. They break too easily (in my experience). 

  
In matrix form:

[![](assets/373-1.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-om1vAwZYHDs/XRF4Ace68EI/AAAAAAAD-xU/Ljr%5FJAVxNos4Mb4FPw%5F6JSDZ9G1pwz7-gCLcBGAs/s1600/%2523373%2B-%2BGood%2Benough.PNG)

  
But here's the deal - **every single one** of those options _work_. They are all _fine_. Each of them could _easily_ be my "main" option that I use for everything. I could learn to live with and work around whatever flaws any given option has. They don't even have to be viewed as flaws. They are only flaws because I choose to think of them that way.

  
The same thing can be said about any of my backpacks or messenger bags. The same thing could be said about my Chromebook vs an iPad. The same thing could be said about the iPhone and any of the various Android phones I've drooled over. The same thing could be said about Google Sheets and Airtable. The same thing could be said about Google Sites or Google Drive or Notion as a host for Gillespedia.com. The same thing could be said about todoist, Things 3, Google Tasks, Microsoft Todo, Wunderlist, or Google Keep. The same thing could be said about **most things** I've spent days and weeks and months thinking about.

  
Do I regret that time? No, not really. Maybe some of it. Mostly I regret the _anxiety_. I've spent unnecessary effort trying curtail imaginary situations in which not having feature X causes me serious harm. I've spent more time in my life than I care to admit looking at options for which liquid vessel I wanted to take to work for a given day. Do I want portability? Do I want to bring the blender bottle?

  
Moreover, I own more crap than I need. Seriously. I have 6 Nalgene bottles, 2 HydroFlasks, one of those Yeti tumblers (mine's a knockoff cause who cares), 2 Tervis Tumblers, and 2 Blender Bottles. My cabinet overfloweth with cups. I own 3 backpacks and 4 messenger bags. I've owned 6 lunchboxes in the past 5 years... and not one of them was "ruined", they all just "could have been better". I own a Chromebook that is an incredible piece of technology, and yet I found myself looking at iPads the other day because my Chromebook is 2 years old. That's _insane_. That the behavior of a rampant consumerist sheep.

  
Unrelated to the above.

  
Sleep. Deep sleep, specifically. It's a precious thing. I've been having trouble with it lately due to having a sick kid. It makes things difficult. If "having a thrown-off biorhythm" is a real thing, it does that. I went two nights with no single span of sleep lasting longer than probably \~2 hours, and on that 3rd day I think I dropped more pens, water bottles, cell phones, pieces of paper, and whatever else you pick up on a daily basis than I did in all of the month of May. A lack of sleep shows you how fragile a well-working brain is. I still am operating at \~70% capacity, if it's not clear from this writing.

  
Top 5: Flaws in apps I called "Flawless" in [Column #371](http://www.aarongilly.com/371)'s Top 5

5\. Apple's Clock App - Active alarms are not highlighted well. Given their standard huge list of alarms at slightly different times-approach to an alarm app, I shouldn't have to scroll the list to be sure there is an alarm on. They should put the active alarms at the top of the list.  
4\. Google Photos - I'd like the ability to have my Google Photos backed up to my local machine automatically. Of all my digital files, photos are the most precious, most irreplaceable... as much as I trust Google, I don't trust that something terrible couldn't happen to them. So I'm manually downloading them. It's a pain.  
3\. Pocket Casts - Podcast transcripts would be great. Also having to pay for the web interface keeps me from widely recommending the app. It didn't support CarPlay.  
2\. LastPass - This one is tougher. LastPass is pretty stellar. It's organization scheme is a bit unnecessary. My website logins don't need to be in folders. It's a bit unclear to me how sharing passwords works, too.  
1\. Pocket - There are other apps that can do the core of what Pocket does that also do a _looot_ of other stuff. Pocket allows you to save articles for later and notate them. So does Evernote, Notion, and other .

Motto: Cross another off the movie bucket list

  
I want a tablet, but...

  
Tablets are the most fun pieces of computing tech out there - even if they may be the least _useful._ Their use IS "fun". They are THE BEST general browsing experience you can find. If you have tons of time to kill and nothing to do, nothing beats a tablet. They provide a more compelling user experience than phones. They aren't as cumbersome as laptops. They are portable in ways that televisions and videogame consoles can't be. They are the **perfect** form factor.

  
... but they _suck_ for input-intensive applications (which is a basic requirement for most "productive" uses of technology). They aren't portable enough to replace a phone. They usually aren't capable enough to replace your computer. Tablets are perfect in theory... In reality, though, their usage case sits in a narrow window.

  
I will say, though, tablets are PERFECT for kids. Long-ish battery life. More games than you could ever play. Movies and music on the go. Your own little world. Who cares if it's a pain to manage email on one? I wish I had a Nexus 7 when I was ten years old. That would have rocked.

  
Segways were a terrible invention... And this is a terrible segway.

  
I like movies - moreso than I think most people realize. (I _did_ major in film for a bit.) I'm working on a bucket list of movies I need to watch. If you have suggestions for this list, let me know:

* Star Wars (all - I'm currently rectifying this huge hole in my movie history)
* Back to the Future (all)
* The Godfather (all)
* Goodfellas
* Scarface (there's a theme here)
* Alien
* Total Recall (the original one)
* For some reason - I really want to watch GATTACCA

Speaking of movies - I wish Hollywood didn't use established actors for every big-production they make. I don't like going to see newest Tom Cruise movie where Tom Cruise plays the character you'll later refer to as "Tom Cruise's character". You never learned the character's name because it wasn't important. It was Tom Cruise. That's just not the way stories should be told. I wish actors and characters were married more heavily. Big name celebrities shouldn't be a thing. If you star in Guardians of the Galaxy, you shouldn't _also_ be the guy in Jurassic World [10 months and 11 days](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=release+date+of+Guardians+of+the+Galaxy+-+release+date+of+Jurassic+World) later... even if I love Chris Pratt just as much as everyone else.

  
The following contains "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" spoilers. Fair warning.

  
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo introduced Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. She absolutely dominated the screen. I bought into her character 100%, because her performance was great and also it wasn't marred by 4 other roles I recognized her from. She was new. She was fresh. I believed her _character_.

  
In that same movie, however, we see a great example of what **not** to do. We follow around the protagonist (played by Daniel Craig) while he investigates this murder than happened a long time ago. During this investigation, we are introduced to a whole host of no-name side characters... and Stellan Skarsgård. Immediately I thought to myself "Oh, well, he did it. He's the famous guy." 

  
I was right. 

  
He was obviously the bad guy because he was the only celebrity (other than the protagonist) that I recognized immediately. For a mystery/thriller, that's a pretty big misstep to make. Imagine if Stellan Skasgård's character (see, I never learned his name) was played by a nobody? Then each person you met had an equal chance of being the murderer. Giving a character to a well-established actor immediately makes you aware that that character is important... which _can_ be a good thing, but is usually better accomplished naturally through plot development.

  
Besides, admit you want more of this from your movies:

That picture is one of my almost 400 movie-themed desktop wallpapers. I'm really proud of my curation with those.

  
Related to my coming Top 5 - a 4k monitor, a good digital microphone, a DSLR...  

  
Top 5: Googley purchases I'd love to justify

2\. The NVIDIA Shield console  
1\. The next Nexus (this one is "above the line")

Motto: DC, KC, ABQ, and stuff  
  
Part of the reason I don't write "Features" all that much anymore is that they take me a LONG time, and they push out other things I'd normally write about. I have an MCU update coming sometime.  
  
Also, I've just been too busy for Aaron Projects. I'm writing this after retroactively filling out two full weeks of "Life Tracker" data. You might wonder "How good is that data if he's filling it out after two weeks?". The answer is: not much. I basically just look at my photo reel and try to piece together what I did each day. Thankfully I take a video every day, so I can at least remember one bit, usually.  
  
Alright - here's some stuff I wrote down to write on here...  
  
**FIXING SPORTS**  
Basketball:  
\- Two 10 minute halves  
\- Each team gets two 30 second time outs (per game)  
\- Shot clock is 30 seconds  
\- Fouls NEVER give an advantage to the fouling team  
\- More clearly defined rules for blocking/charging fouls  
\- More clearly defined (or universally applied) travelling rules  
\- A sliding "run rule" where the game ends if one team clearly won't win  
  
Football:  
\- I don't know enough about football to fix it  
  
Baseball:  
\- 5 innings or 2 hours, whichever comes first  
\- Introducing delay-of-game rules  
\- Computerized calling of balls & strikes  
\- You can get a player out by hitting them with the ball (baseballs would be made a bit softer)  
  
Soccer:  
\- Two 10 minute halves  
\- Each team gets two 30 seconds time outs (per game)  
\- All soccer is now indoor soccer  
\- Courts are sized between a tennis court and a basketball court  
\- 5 players to a team  
\- Nets are slightly bigger - for more goals overall  
\- Fouls are verified by instant replay, if you fake a foul you're ejected from the premises  
  
Volleyball:  
\- All volleyball is beach volleyball  
  
Boxing:  
\- Just turn boxing into MMA fighting  
  
Golf:  
\- Less expensive  
\- Less formal  
  
Tennis:  
\- Scores go by 1, games are played to 5 (still gotta win by 2)  
\- Matches consist of 3 games  
\- No do-overs for bad serves  
  
Pool:  
\- Everyone plays by the same set of rules... the ones I prefer to use  
  
....And that concludes my segment on how to fix sports.  
  
By the way, pool is definitely not a "sport". Golf probably isn't either, to me. Those are games. Sports involve running, in my mind. If you consider pool a sport, then you have to consider darts and bowling sports. Then, if you're going to do that, you gotta do poker. Then if you're going to do that, you gotta do other card games and stuff. What I'm saying here is there should be a commonly agreed upon definition for "sports" and it should be distinct from "games".  
  
Speaking of commonly agreed upon definitions, here are some other ones I've been wanting to write about for a month.  
  
**AARON DEFINES VAGUE THINGS**  
"Tall"  
\- For girls, 5'10" to 6'1"  
\- For guys, 6'3" to 6'6"  
\- Anything over that is worthy of the "very" qualifier, or other more colorful descriptions (such as "Sasquatchian")  
  
"Weekend"  
\- Friday after business hours until Sunday at bed time  
  
"Bed time"  
\- when you normally go to sleep, I'm not so presumptuous that I think my bedtime should apply to everyone  
  
"Next weekend"  
\- This cannot be any time within the next 7 days, Saturday and Sunday within the next 7 days are called "This weekend"  
  
"Literally"  
\- Literally means literally  
  
....and there were supposed to be more, but I've forgotten them.  
  
**ANOTHER THOUGHT AARON WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT**  
I re-watched a Bo Burnham special on Netflix the other day. He looks like me. Maybe me mixed with Nick G. Maybe not.  
  
ALRIGHT!  
  
I went to Washington DC to visit my friends up there. It was a perfect vacation. I got to see and do stuff without having to worry about logistics. It was like a cruise, but without the ship bits. I could talk at length about what we did and how awesome it was, but I'd rather just tell you in person. Ask me about it if you're curious.  
  
I will show you some pictures, though. HERE GOES  
  
Top 5: Pictures from Last Week (in Random Order)  
5\. This is what the eclipse looked like for us.

I just now realized how few pictures I take nowadays. I have a ton of videos, but not a lot of stills. That's okay. I had a great time.

Hi!  
  
Right out the gate - my cousins were in town & here's this awesome continuation our traditional "Crackers" photo:

If anyone knows of a hardware store with a sign denoting where they sell their studs, please let us know.  
  
Lately I've been changed my attitude about several things. I'm not sure what's driven it, but I have fallen into a zen mode. I want fewer distractions. I want to do life things. Let's buy a house. Let's have a kid (JK NOT YET I'M SO YOUNG). For real, though, I feel like I'm in a period of great mental clarity. I don't know what's brought it on, but I hope it stays for a while. I have uninstalled Fallout 4\. I'm not watching a TV show while I'm writing this. I'm not wanting to do 8 things at once. I want to do one thing that I'm 8 times more passionate about. Here's a depiction of the transformation I'd like to make:

In other news...  
  
The biggest news from Google I/O after the fact was the coming of Android apps to ChromeOS. One common (and mostly unnecessary) complaint about Chromebooks is their lack of ability to install programs. My next Chromebook will be home to a Google Play Store that has 2.2 million applications to explore, and I couldn't be more excited. It's got me looking ahead to the holiday season this year when I can hopefully upgrade this couple-year-old model.   
  
This Android/ChromeOS news has implications on my goals. It's been my ambition for years to create a portable, shareable version of [the Life Tracker](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/feature-life-tracker.html) (which I'm considering renaming "Captain's Log", by the way). For a long time I've been stuck with analysis paralysis about whether or not I wanted to just convert the Google Apps Script-based version I wrote originally over three years ago or if I wanted to start from scratch with an Android version. My thoughts on the subject were summarized as so:  
  
**Reasons to use Google Apps Script:**  
  
* Coding is easier. I can already do it.
* The final product is spreadsheet-based, which allows for incredible flexibility for the end user.
* It's platform independent. Available to anyone of any operating system and any form factor.
* There's basically zero competition.
**Reasons to use Android:**  
  
  
* Nobody in the normal world things "I'm going to use a Google Apps Scripts solution!" when they are searching for a tool to solve their tracking-related problems. An Android app from the Google Play Store is much much more approachable.
* Android is probably in the first 10 words someone would put in a word cloud around a picture of me.
* It would be more challenging, which makes it better.
* I've always wanted to call myself an Android developer. People understand "he makes apps" a lot better than "he's got this crazy spreadsheet with a JavaScript backend that ties into various RESTful APIs.

There's extremely solid arguments to be made on both sides... but knowing that I could create an Android app that could also then be accessed from my laptop is the thing that pushes it over the edge for me.

  
One last thing I've been wanting to write about. Here goes.

  
I feel like many of the major problems people have in their lives that they've struggled to control have well-known, simple, yet extremely unsexy solutions. People want a pill or a trick that will burn off the fat. They want to find a fortune on the street or win the lottery to solve their money woes. They want to be faster, stronger, healthier, and better looking. They want to finally stop smoking. All day these people have trendy and new-age "solutions" advertised at them, promising to help them achiever their goals and fix their problems with no effort or suffering on their part (other than 3 easy payments of $9.99).

There are already solutions for all of those things that work great... and they've been around long enough that you could read about them at your local library - in the 1940's. 

  
Want to lose weight? Track your food. See how much you eat. Aim to eat less. Adjust your intake to move that average while continuing to track food. 

Want more money? Track your expenses. See where you're spending your money and cut out some of the less necessary expenses.

Want to be faster, stronger, healthier, and better-looking? Go running. Do simple lifts. Sweat more often. Buy healthier stuff and eat what you buy. Health follows those things. Better-looking follows health.

Want to stop smoking? Just stop smoking. Don't buy cigarettes.

  
Simple solutions. Effective solutions.
  
  
Top 5: Things I'd Like to Do More of, but Would Require More Free Time  
5\. Noodle more guitar. I cannot really _play_ guitar... but I may have achieved "noodling" status.   
4\. Film and edit more videos. I have ideas written down from literally years ago I haven't ever tried.  
3\. Pushups. Planks. Pullups. Runs. Bikes.   
2\. Finish that Udacity curriculum I got halfway through. Continue learning to code in a semistructured way. Make a sharable version of the Life Tracker.  
1\. Write more. Write more abstract.

# Motto: Things are Crazy, and Crazy is Good

It's been a long time since I've had a legitimate column update. There's a good reason for that - everything has changed:
* Melissa's back.
* My room is all different.
* My free time is spent in a new, different, much less lonesome manner.
* Work started taking more of my time, resources, and mental faculties. 
* Wedding plans are in the early stages.
* Workouts have been two-tiered & double-sided.
* My diet has changed.
* I have to deal with a cat more often than I would like.
* I've spent time with family; not so much my now family, but more of my soon family.
* Many projects have been temporarily shelved.
* Big plans are being formulated.
* The amount of live music I listen to skyrocketed.
* Google.
* One of my best friends tied the knot.
* I saw a group of some of my favorite people on the planet.
* This is the 100th Column (on Blogger, at least).
* There are still tons of things I want to write about.
* I made this video:

Motto: It's not what you say or how you say it; it's what it looks like.

  
This Column is mostly a list of related definitions. It started out as a paragraph exhausting my knowledge of fonts, but wound up being an entire research project. Learning something new about what I see and use every day was interesting and a little fun. Hopefully it's half as good as a second hand experience. I wrote this yesterday, but wasn't able to post it. Without further ado, let's get started! "Typeface" is what people usually think of when they think of the word "Font". "Times" is a typeface, not a font. "Font" refers only to the size, weight, and style of a particular typeface. "Italic, 10-point Times" is a different font than "bold 11-point Times", despite sharing a common typeface. The word "glyph", when referred to in the context of typography, refers to any given character. Technically speaking, I think keyboards are full of glyphs, not characters. However, I will use the two interchangeably, "Weight" refers to the thickness of a glyph. **Bold = heavy weight**. "Point" is a unit of measure supposedly equal to 1/72nd of an inch. In theory, if you were to measure the distance between the top of an "h" and the bottom of a "p" of a printed off 12-point font, it should be 1/6th inch. There are two main typographical categories: serif and sans serif.   

  
"Serif" refers to the small design elements at the end of the strokes making up each glyph. Sometimes serif typefaces are referred to as "Roman"; and I don't generally prefer them.  
  
"Sans serif" fonts don't have any fanciness at their points - they are literally without serif. They are sometimes referred to as "Gothic"; and I think they look cleaner.  
  
"Serif/sans serif" is not my favorite typographical distinction, though. My favorite distinction revolves around character width.  
  
Typefaces using glyphs of varying widths are referred to as being "proportional". Since most typefaces are proportional, the distinction is usually not explicitly stated.  
  
On the other side of that coin are "monospace" typefaces. In a monospace typeface, such as Courier, the "w" and "i" characters are the same width. This can be awkward, though, because "i" and "w" shouldn't take up the same amount of space. What's cool about monospace typefaces is that characters on different rows of text will always vertically line up with each other. Any given string of 10 characters will be the same length, and that can be useful.  
  
  
Nobody likes Comic Sans.

  
Top 5: My Favorite Typefaces

5\. Bookman Old Style - the only serif font on this list (I cannot reproduce this typeface for the column)  
4\. Lucida Console (again, cannot reproduce)  
3\. Eurostile (again, cannot reproduce)2\. Trebuchet MS  
1\. Verdana - the default typeface of the Column

It's been a while since I've written. I have had a lot of heavy trains of thought in that time. Daunting ones that would take a lot of time and energy to write about. Stuff like "time" and "energy". Instead of doing that, I'm going to make a simple, little list of good habits I wish I could do better.

# Good Habits I Suck At

- Break a sweat every day
- Meditate frequently
- Go for a walk
- Get out of bed early, and never snooze
- Making your bed in the morning
- Exercising in the morning
- Shutting off screens at least 2 hours before bed time
- Having a good, firm bedtime
- Eat vegetables every meal
- Practice an instrument
- Go for a bike ride
- Practice intentional gratitude
- Sketch things
- Follow a budget
- Read physical books
- Take online classes (and finish them)
- Go for a jog
- Get out of your comfort zone frequently
- Volunteering
- Engage in polite conversation with strangers
- Call your mom, ask her how her day is going
- Pray
- Leave your phone in a specific spot in your house, only use it if you go to that spot
- Clean up after yourself every place you go, everything you do, every time
- Take pride in your vehicle
- Always sleep on big purchase decisions
- Practice mental math

By the way - that picture is from the website [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com), which is a really *really* neat website. It's basically a really great repository of actually *good* photos with a reuse license that basically just says "go nuts". Carte Blanche. I really get behind it, as a concept. It's a bit like open-source photography. Makes me want to get more into photography, actually. Seems like a good habit to get into... WAIT CONTINUATION OF MY LIST FROM ABOVE!

# Top 5: Good Habits I'm Actually Don't Suck At

1. Cable cutting... I just never had it to begin with. So this is cheating.
2. Keeping track of habits. I just fell into this one with my more broad goal to "keep track of life". Also it's not a perfect, exhaustive list of habits.
3. Doing something creative every so often. Like this. Even if it's not much.
4. Sleeping consistently enough hours. The hours I do move around a lot, but I do usually get 7 contiguous hours, provided my child sleeps well enough.
5. Talking with my spouse. A lot. About everything... I mean.... I think I'm good. I haven't asked her opinion on the matter.

Motto: Hello! My Name is... Mr. Complainer

I'm in a good mood. I've switched NSAIDs and my back feels great. I've had some great times over the past week and everything is going really well.  
  
Now prepare for me to dump on stuff for the rest of the Column. First up, healthcare. Then, Google. Afterward I'll slide into a more fun Top 5 and leave you with several quotes.  
  
As I've written about fairly recently - I have a disease. Not the kind of disease you can avoid by washing your hands or eating healthy. I have the kind that you just... get. At least that's the best science really has to say about the issue. It's nobody's fault. There's nothing I could have done to prevent it. But it's here and it's permanent. I will be on some form of medication for the rest of my life.  
  
I was going to write a ton here about our current healthcare system and insurance and how everything is woefully hamstrung, but this is the last part of the Column I'm writing and I don't want to get into it all, cause it's a big topic that I'm too passionate about to just give it "a portion" of a Column. It could be an entire blog of its own. We should have a single-payer healthcare system. But that's a topic for another time.  
  
I switched NSAIDs. Think of it like I switched from asprin to ibuprofen. Those aren't them, but it's pretty close. **THANK GOD** my new NSAID is working right now, because the next step down the line is a "Biologic" drug, such as Humira. Humira, according to my insurance's "estimate the out-of-pocket cost of your drugs" would cost me **$3,106.04** for a **30-day supply**. That's just a complete non-starter. That would be the equivalent of me buying [this incredibly nice house,](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/12306-Granada-Ln-Leawood-KS-66209/75608375%5Fzpid/?fullpage=true) on top of my current one... and also an buying a new iPad every month. And what would I get for that cost? A normal life.  
  
Leaving it at that could be a bit disingenuous. There _are_ payment plans & rumors of "programs" I might be able to explore. Also my insurance also has an annual out-of-pocket maximum that _in theory_ should apply after I spend roughly all of the money I make in January and February on it on 4 syringes. But, even if I only spent that amount - I'd have to sell my house. Or one of the cars. Or maybe quit the job I love to find another job whose health insurance is more consumer-friendly. Or take another job on top of my current one. Or just live in constant pain forever.  
  
What I have is _**insurance**_, what I want is _**assurance**_... I don't think it should be that hard.

Switching topics now - I'm going to complain about Google. I write about Google a lot. It used to be about how cool of a company they are, and what great things they do... and I still think those things. But the rose-colored glasses have come off. I'm going to title this segment **"WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE, GOOGLE?"**

**Google Fit**

Google Fit was announced three years ago. Seeing the Google Fit logo for the first time during Google I/O was one of the most exciting things I can recall for me from ANY I/O. There they promised a single set of APIs, showing a complete picture of the user's fitness, blending data from multiple apps and devices. Their announcement was a little vague on how that would work, but my mind was instantly thinking of what sorts of things they would obviously include. When the app debuted, it was missing a few things from my list. Now that it's been 3 years - let's look at the list of things it seems like Google Fit should have:  
\- Weight - good job with this one, Googs!  
\- Running - good job here, too!  
\- Sports - sports are sort of handled, that's not too bad!  
\- Food tracking - technically supported, but you can't see it in the Google Fit app  
\- Sleep tracking - technically supported, but you can't see it in the Google Fit app  
\- Water - technically supported, but only by niche apps whose only purpose is that  
\- Weightlifting - after 3 years it's technically supported... but only by using Android Wear, and there's a zero percent chance it would show in the app.  
I thought Google Fit was going to render the health & fitness portion of my Life Tracker unnecessary with this service. They didn't give me a fish, nor did they teach me how to fish. They just gave me a hook and some string and said "good luck!"  
**Google Home**

The Google Home is my every day reminder that somebody over there has the priorities backwards. The Google Home is capable of some truly AMAZING things - but it's incapable of some truly OBVIOUS things. It's actually a _worse_ product now than I was when I bought it 6 months ago. It used to work with the Shopping List that Melissa and I want to use. Now it only works with the shopping list Google wants us to use. Nice. There goes 15% of the reason we use it every day. Also, I'm sick of saying "Okay Google" and "Hey Google" is only slightly better. Why I can't I choose my own wake word? Beyond that, there's just some really surface-level, obvious things it doesn't do.

  
_Here's an example conversation_:

Okay Google... where's my phone?

_I'm sorry I don't know how to find devices yet_

Okay Google... remind me to find workarounds to your shortcomings.

_I'm sorry I can't do reminders yet_

Okay Google... add an Amazon Echo to my shopping list.

_I'll add an Amazon Echo to your shopping list_

Oh yeah, I won't see that because I don't want to use "Google Express" to list the things I'll buy when I go to the store. So that's worthless. Literally without worth. It does me no good.  
  
If it weren't for the Chromecast integration, I would have returned the Google Home for an Amazon Echo by now.

  
**Google Messaging**

This is maybe the crown jewel of frustrations maybe people have with Google (aside from them just cancelling services that people use all the time). Their scatterbrained approach to messaging, in just the past 5 years, has been mind-blowing.

You want to send a message to your friend? You should use Google Chat. 

No wait - Google Voice. 

No wait - Hangouts in Google+.

No wait - Android Messenger.

No wait - Hangouts outside of Google+.

No wait - Allo for text-based messaging and Duo for video chats... we've added AI to your messenger, but removed useful features like a web interface, consistent chats between devices, or multi-person video chatting. 

  
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE, GOOGLE?

  
Ugh.

  
ALRIGHT HAPPY FUN TIME PICTURE TO GO OUT ON!

Motto: Google's Indexing the Internet, Alphabetically  
  
I'm embarrassed by that motto.  
  
Trebuchet is my favorite font. Presuming your browser didn't hijack my typeface, you should be reading this in Trebuchet. Isn't it great?  
  
I wrote a whole post about my height and relationship to basketball. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, I have lost that post. Literally, I lost the USB drive that I had the post on. My current theory is that it was on Oceanic Flight 815.  
  
**_LOST_**  
A few days back, I was shocked to read that Google's founders were creating a _new_ company, under which Google would fall. The new company: Alphabet. I thought it was going to be huge news. Then, I figured out it really doesn't change anything. THEN, I realized it's changing _everything_... eventually. This move is not immediately interesting, but could eventually be a very large headline in a "History of Consumer Technology" book.  
  
Google Hangouts is perhaps finally getting the love & attention it has deserved from day one. [This link](http://hangouts.google.com/) is what I'm referring to.  
  
Android "M" now has an official name and version number. The name: "Marshmallow"... which was fairly well expected. The version number: 6.0\. This was not expected for what appeared to be a fairly small release. Seriously, there's not too much there from what I can see (which is admittedly very little, from this chair). See the Top 5 for the new features of Android Marshmallow. Spoiler alert - I'm skeptical/underwhelmed.  
  
[![](assets/256-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cRF0ZFIj3vs/VdPlSA9JV8I/AAAAAAAB62w/buVISUqbr3k/s1600/%2523256%2B-%2BAndroid%2BMarshmallow.jpg)

  
I added a new feature to the Life Tracker. First one in quite some time. Basically, now it gets a weather _forecast_ for the upcoming day. It used to only get the weather _history_ for the previous day. This new change will give me a glimpse at the upcoming weather for the day & will prevent holes in the data when OpenWeatherMap's API honks up.  
  
Top 5: Android Marshmallow Features  
5\. Android Pay - because Google Wallet has been a terrible flop in the real world, Google is reworking the system and rebranding under the Android moniker. Worked for Android TV, didn't it? (didn't it?... _didn't it?!_)  
4\. Fingerprints - a good payment system needs a way to authenticate your payments that isn't obtrusive to the user. Fingerprints are not good ways to authenticate... but I am 100% sure that despite that well-founded opinion I am going to use mine this way anyways.  
3\. App Permissions - the new permissions system pops up only when the app _needs_ them. This is the way it should have been all along.  
2\. USB-C. Android phones are moving to the USB Type C (USB-C) standard. NOTE THIS IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS LIST THAT ISN'T JUST AN iOS FEATURE PARITY UPGRADE... and even _this_ could be argued to be a move closer to the iPhone. We're getting a reversible connector.   
1\. Now on Tap - supposedly this is "huge". It's basically a way to run Google search magic on whatever's on your screen. It's a vaguely defined feature that will probably be underwhelming at first but get better over time. This is the only truly _new_ thing I really remember from the Google I/O announcement.

Motto: Optimism Meets Realism Meets Writing  
  
Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand minutes!

Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand moments so dear!

Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand minutes!

How do you measure, measure 30 years?

  
I measured 5 years using the Life Tracker. I know that doesn't account for the other 5/6ths of the data you asked about. Sorry I don't know what to tell you.  
  
That's right. I started a retrospective of the past 30 years of my life with a R.E.N.T. joke. Clearly I'm going **deep** with this Column.  
  
[Five Years ago I wrote a Column](https://www.aarongilly.com/103) talking about how awesome turning 25 is and how awesome the next 25 years were going to be. I wrote how I was excited to relive every day I had already been alive, but with "_at least my current level of understanding and faculty, my current level of independence and capability_". Looking back I see what I was getting at... but I might take a slightly less "everything is great" approach. In the last five years I've struggled with things I never had before. I'm forgetting things I learned in college. I'm hurt myself while exercising. I've hurt myself while _warming up_ to exercise.   
  
BUT!  
  
I've gotten married. I've also switched jobs to one I enjoy. I've been fairly successful with maintaining my health. I've become a homeowner. And soon... a father.   
  
I guess what I'm saying is at 25, I thought I was going to live to see another 25 years worth of days exactly like those around my 25th birthday.... but the next 25 years aren't going to be like the past 30\. They're going to be different. Different isn't better, nor worse. It's just what's next.  
  
In that same Column from 2013 I debuted my first Second-A-Day-For-A-Year video - My 24th Year. In the following 4 years I added to [the continuous story of my mid-to-late 20s](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw). There's not a "My 29th Year" Second-A-Day video attached to this Column or in that playlist. There will be one soon, but there won't be a "My 30th Year". I'm moving to something better.  
  
My numbering was off by one the whole time anyway. This wasn't my 29th year, it was my 30th. When you turn an age, that's the number of years you've already lived. You weren't born at -1\. Idiot.  
  
Meh. I'm not infallible. I'm just old.

Top 5: Best, Most Succinct Self-Realizations I've Ever Had  
5\. I'd rather not have something I want, than have something I don't want.  
4\. I'm both extremely driven by my interests and completely incapable of choosing them.  
3\. I'm a very competitive person who doesn't like serious competitions.  
2\. My train of thought carries a lot of momentum.  
1\. I've been incredibly lucky in every way that matters in my life.

Motto: The Quantified Masses, The Hunt for Ripped October, The Yes Man Cometh, All Other Potential Names

  
I wrote this big huge long piece about the quantified self, but posting it now seems like beating a dead horse. There was one particularly important bit that I don't want to kill, so here's my "one last thing":   

[![](assets/207-1.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5imSNqRWe84/VCt2KepEquI/AAAAAAABeUI/RbNQaDcHSoY/s1600/%23207%2B-%2BHealthKit%2Bvs%2BGoogle%2BFit.png)

The quantified self movement has been edging in on "mainstream" for years now thanks to Fitbit, Jawbone, and Nike. I think it is about to get a violent shove into the limelight by both Apple and Google. Apple's HealthKit (the heart on the right) and Google Fit (the heart on the left) are two platforms for health and fitness being built into the two dominant Operating Systems of the day. Apple's introduction of iOS 8 earlier this week gave the world the Health app - a central repository for all of your quantified health and fitness data. The Apple Watch will be a member of a large category of devices that feed data into this platform. As soon as Apple addresses a bug, applications will start feeding data into the Health app. Meanwhile, Google's next version of Android (rumored to come out in about a month) will be introducing a similar \*\*\*concept, but not a similar \*\*\*application. Google is \*\*\*not believed to be working on its own fitness application, but instead merely providing a framework for developers to build their own 3rd party solutions. Whereas Apple's health app will store your fitness data on your phone, Google will be storing it in the cloud. This plus a RESTful API will allow web developers to use the Google Fit platform. I was very impressed with Apple's Health App in the 3 minute overview my wife game me. It looked awesome. I can only hope I have such strong feelings with my own OS of choice someday. **---
-------------------- and that's the end of that** **---
-------------------** I had several hundred words down here, but I'm not going to make you read any of it. I write because I enjoy writing. Not necessarily because I feel the need to have tons of people read my stuff. There's a reason I don't evangelicalize this blog. Mystery 30 Day Challenge! Today marks the transition between months, and thus the transition between 30 day challenges. On September 2nd I wrote about the August challenge and announced that this month's challenge was a secret. That was not meant to drum up interest, it was mostly meant to show that I WAS in fact keeping up this running New Year's resolution, but telling everyone would ruin the challenge.  
  
  
For the past 30 days, I've been a Yes Man. I knew when I started these 30 Day Challenges that I wanted to do a month of saying "yes", I just couldn't let anyone know that, because that's when people start saying "hey, you should, like, uh, see how long you can stand on the roof of my car as I drive around town!". 

  
[![](assets/207-2.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hEoM3chZjOg/VCt4NtC-zKI/AAAAAAABeUQ/wljWF1yG2wU/s1600/%23207%2B-%2BYes%2BMan.jpg)

I saw the movie "Yes Man" for the first time 8 years ago when it was out in theaters. Although critics did NOT like the movie, I really enjoyed it. I've seen it probably a dozen times now - not because it's hilarious or because it's a good movie or anything, but just because it's got a really upbeat vibe and a positive message. I even checked out and read the book "Yes Man" that inspired the movie. The book is very, very, very different. The main character isn't the same dude. He takes on the challenge voluntarily. He describes how his life changed in a few hundred hilarious pages. It's definitely worth the read. Anyway. Here's what 30 Days of saying "yes" to everything was like: Not that different! For several reasons - I don't say "no" all that often, I don't get invited to do things I'd likely say "no" to all that often, and because this month was so busy I didn't have much time to do anything anyways. There were some differences, though. I made a list: Things I said "Yes" to that proved interesting: Watching football at my buddies house with a ton of his friends. Made a fantasy football trade that I wouldn't have otherwise made - that has ended up benefiting me in the long run. Sweeping the floor at First Watch. Waking up at the same time as Melissa, even though I really could sleep in for another hour. Watching football at my other buddies house. Waking up at the same time as Melissa, even though I really could sleep in for another hour... again. Going to the gym when I didn't really want to, finding an art show instead. Waking up with Melissa... I just stopped writing this down. Learned the "Thriller" dance. Drank a shot of 2 liquors, 2 mixers, and a wine all combined. Watched "Oldboy" thanks to the lid of my Jones Soda. Went to Chuy's for happy hour. Note that I wouldn't have said "no" to all of the above things... I definitely would have done a few of them voluntarily. However, not having the option to say "no" made some of those things much, much easier. Even without the option to say "no", I think I probably cheated on several occasions. If I had two offers in conflict with one another, I could pick between them. I managed to stay in bed a few mornings because Melissa didn't phrase her "you should get up!" in a direct manner. Really, I could have done a better job. Overall, though, it was a very fun and successful month. I'm going to continue to say "Yes" more. Next month's challenge: The same as [last year's October Challenge](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/10/127-october-project-ended-4-days-shy.html) \- eat a lot. Lift a lot.

Motto: I Just Want to Play What I Have on What I Have

  
There was a time when your movie collection and your music collection were both stored on magnetic strips inside of little tape cartridges.Then, sometime in the late 90's/early 2000's people started transitioning their music collection over to some weird circular mirror discs with finger-sized holes in the middle of them. A few years later, your movie collection started to make that transition too. Right around the same time that you started keeping your movie collection on weird circular mirror discs, you started transitioning your music collection to digital "MP3" files. These weren't physical objects at all. Your entire music collection could then be stored on one computer instead of in a bunch of racks & shelves. Then, the movies never really followed. What gives? Why don't all of my DVDs get stored at Mom & Dad's place in the basement with my CDs? Why are the DVDs so special? It's safe to say that we, as a society, have largely transitioned away from the physical medium when it comes to purchasing, storing, and playing music. Why have movies lagged behind in this transition? - I actually have a pretty decent, but long-winded theory as to why this happened the way it did, but I'll save my breath. The thesis is this: I want to buy, store, and play my movies the same way I do my music... and I can. Google Play has movies. So does iTunes... but those movies are locked into the ecosystem. You can't really download the file and take it with you where you go. You can't open up a folder on your computer called "movies" and start watching. Your library is just a library of links into their library. They control the actual content and how and where you can view it. I don't like that. I want to have a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device full of all of my music, movies, pictures, whatever. I want a true library. One where I can see the files. And I want to be able to access those files from my television, computer, and phone. Figuring that out is going to be one of the first projects I tackle after the wedding. On a kinda-sorta-if-you-think-about-it related note: I want an authentic Captain America shield. A heavy, colorful, circular, convex, ridid shield that may or may not be made from Wakandan Vibranium. Or perhaps a Mjolnir of my own - an engraved stone hammer that may or may not be forged in the heart of a dying star. Is that too much to ask? I'd be willing to settle for a stainless steel shield and hammer. I'm a perfectly reasonable guy. I just want a pair of ridiculous weapons because I saw some really buff superheroes throw them around in some movies and I'm pretty sure the only thing keeping me from being just like them is the proper equipment. Anybody know anyone with the proper equipment and knowhow to blacksmith such objects? If so, tell them I will pay them in gold coins\* to produce for me said objects. \*Filled with chocolate.  
  
This one one of those posts that I don't have a great picture for. So here's a random one I saved for just this type of occasion.

Motto: Mod podge

  
I keep a backlog of ideas for the column. Every time I write, I draw from the backlog... but I don't always get through everything. Slowly the backlog fills. Right now, I have several Top 5's stacked up and a couple other random topics to talk about. 

  
This is post is a menagerie of goodness.

  
First...

  
Over the holidays I got to play the board game Telestrations with my family. While playing, we discovered that my father and I have eerily similar thought processes when it comes to playing Pictionary. Check it out:  
  
  
[![](assets/134-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6JckjKgsUI8/Us7rkC41WwI/AAAAAAABGe8/Gynj4Ej0WXU/s1600/DadVsMe.png)
  
  
Which of those did I draw, and which did my dad draw? (Dad's were the better ones.)

  
Next subject...  
  
I think people don't understand the Incredible Hulk as a character. At the climax of the Avengers movie, Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk and works with the rest of the Avengers to save New York. Now, I've heard several people point out how "convenient" it is that was able to control his rage at the end of the movie, but when he Hulked out on the helicarrier he was a monster.   
  
What I don't think they get is that _the nature of his transformation determines how the Hulk behaves_. In the helicarrier, he was simultaneously injured and startled, turning him into a Hulk trying to defend itself from everything. At the end of the 2008's "The Incredible Hulk" that Bruce Banner (who looks way different back then) is seen meditating alone. Then, the audience sees that he has started the transformation into the Hulk voluntarily:  
  
  
[![](assets/134-2.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QvhpyF2qxcE/Us7tPVyvSMI/AAAAAAABGfI/6%5FvMWmuXYSY/s1600/%23134+-+Hulk+in+Control.PNG)

  
I believe that smile at the end is supposed to imply two things. One, that he is in control. Because is turning into the Hulk voluntarily, he is in control. Two, that he's accepted that the Hulk is a part of him. The second one doesn't have anything to do with my argument, but it does tie a nice little bow around the movie (in which he spends the whole time trying to fix himself and remove the Hulk).  
  
Thus, when he transforms in the streets of New York, he's doing so on purpose. He is (mostly) in control as the Hulk. Also it helped that there were hundreds of Alien targets around for him to smash.  
  
Next subject - which is actually somewhat related...  
  
I very terribly photoshopped Loki's trademark helmet onto my cat, Loki.  
  
  
[![](assets/134-3.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-43kQQ44yy1w/Us7ukElblVI/AAAAAAABGfQ/%5FhGMgovtFzQ/s1600/Loki.jpg)

  
Last subject...  
  
The following is a short list of objects nobody seems to appreciate as much as I do... or maybe it's just a list of things I over appreciate:  
  
**Waterbottles**   
Water is the elixir of life. Water is all important and I like to always have some with me; that's why I like a good waterbottle.  
  
**Bags**   
I love tools. Tools give you the ability to perform functions you couldn't otherwise do. To adapt an old adage from photography, the best tools are the ones you have on you. Bags let you keep more tools around and available. Pockets can only go so far. Also, bags give you a place to put the crap that you collect throughout the day. If manpurses were accepted as a part of Western society, I'd have one.  
  
**Smartphones**  
I've harped on this before. I'm not going to revisit it.

Top 5: High-Level Benefits of Exercise (a.k.a. Why You Need to Exercise)

5\. Exercise improves your quality of sleep. You fall asleep easier and wake up more rested. Basically, exercise does what bed commercials tell you their beds will do.  
4\. Exercise makes you look good. Although diet is much more important, exercise is still a vital component. This leads to better self-confidence and self-esteem.  
3\. Exercising gives you more energy throughout the day.  
2\. Exercise helps boost your mood!  
1\. Exercise helps prevent disease. Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, certain cancers, and much more.  
  
  
Top 5: Companies I Won't Buy from because of Their Stupid Ads

5\. Old Navy used to be on this list. Their commercials in the mid-2000's were horrible.  
4\. GoDaddy - domain registry has never before so heavily leaned on the "sex sells" mantra. It makes no sense and, more importantly, the ads are annoying.  
3\. The first two are weak because I had to come up with them off the top of my head. The next two are the _reason_ I wanted to write this.  
2\. Geico - Those commercials with the talking paintings. They are atrocious. They are on Hulu and I see them every day. Every day I tell Hulu they are not relevant to me. Every day I mute it. I've been subjected to them enough. Thus I refuse to save 15% or more.  
1\. Jared Galleria of Jewelry - "He went to Jared". No, I didn't and no I won't.  
  
  
Top 5: Battles in Tech

  
5\. Facebook vs. Twitter  
4\. AT&T vs. Verizon  
3\. Google vs. Apple  
2\. Samsung vs. Everyone  
1\. Microsoft vs. Microsoft  
  
  
**Top 5: Things I Want in My Future House** 5\. An awesome Battlestation work desk. This was my first priority when I started buying my own furniture, and I'm sitting at mine right now. Positively no regrets. I love it. 4\. A woodshop and gym in the garage or barn. I've already got a pretty solid outline of how it would be laid out and what components each of them would have. 3\. A really nice and small media room. One couch. One large TV. Surround sound. Everything run through one internet connected blu-ray player with Chromecast capabilities (Chromecast capability is going to be built into things in the not-too-distant future). 2\. A shower I can stand up in. Stand all the way up. I want the water to hit me in the top of the head, not the throat. 1\. Melissa, 2-3 kids, a dog, and maybe a cat.

# Motto: Why yes, I can Engineer that for you...

I walked across the floor of Allen Fieldhouse. I walked down the hill. I walked out of The University of Kansas with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering; thus ending my streak of 18 straight years in a formal education institution. If I had just listened to my gifted teacher in high school I would have been done in 17 years. Film was a mistake... but I'm glad I made it. Things would have been different if I hadn't, and I like the way things turned out.

This is not to say I wouldn't change some things if I could go back. I could have taught myself how to study. How to do homework. How to work with my peers. How to have a fun life.

Brief overview of college (the way it was):

I studied film for a year and a half
I switched to (after many changes in a two week span) Electrical Engineer
I met many of what I now consider to be my best friends
I lived to two of the best friends I've ever had
I met a special lady
I RA'd for over 120 people, liked many of them! Will miss a lot of them dearly
I went to the Orange Bowl and watched KU win over Virginia Tech in a nail-biter
I watched 2 National Championship games in Allen Fieldhouse, one of which we won
I quit blogging
I started blogging again (hopefully for good this time)
I got my first Android phone (for those of you who know me, you know how big this is)
I learned calculus, embraced the inner nerd
I watched Hot Rod, The Boondock Saints 2, and all the Avengers movies in theaters
I worked for and with some great people both in the summers and during the year
I grew about 2 inches
I gained about 50 pounds
There really is no way to list everything that should be listed. I'm going to leave it there. This post has been dogging me. I know it's a big post. The first post after the close of me undergraduate career. What's next?

# Top 5: Things I learned in college
5. Computer coding
4. Circuit design
3. Calculus
2. How the engineering design process works
1. How to twirl my pen around my thumb.

# Scott Pilgrim vs the World
![WSPvtWaM](assets/409-1.jpg)

The title of this Column is a reference to Scott Pilgrim vs the World, which my podcast covered in our latest episode. I love this movie. I don't love Scott Pilgrim the character, nor really do I love all of the choices that were made in Michael Cera's portrayal of the titular character, but the movie as a whole package is phenomenal. It's funny, fast paced, well written, well shot, with great characters and a bunch of very famous people before they made it big. If you're under 35 and haven't seen it, I reckon Scott Pilgrim is a good old time.  
Also I am reading the comic it's based on. Turns out that is also great. Highly recommended as well.
# The Intermediate Future
There are a LOT of things I'm looking forward to packed into the second half of 2021. Here it's an incomplete chronologically ordered-ish list of things for which I am quite excited.
## June
9th - The Loki series will debut on Disney+ - it's the first of a theme of MCU releases you'll see in this list.  
20th - Rock and Morty session 5 debuts, which I hope to enjoy more than I did most of season 4 *(which I found disappointing)*.  
I am aiming to have my first legitimate use of the newly released Notion API. Not sure yet if I want to pull data FROM Notion or push data TO Notion to begin with. Ultimately both will happen.  
We have a couple of much needed vacations lined up. A parents only vacation and a whole family one.  
## July 
9th - Black Widow release date simultaneously on Disney+ and theaters.  
## August
I get to eat cake and feel no guilt for a day.  
6th - The Suicide Squad releases on HBO Max.  
My first born turns 3.  
Melissa and I take possession of a lovely house in Lawrence, Kansas where we went to college, met, and fell in love.  
Marvels "What If...?" series comes out sometime this month.  
## September
3rd - Shang Chi come out - one I'm **very** excited for
Hopefully we sell our current house for a decent price and without any hiccups.  
## October
1st - Dune releases in theaters.  
My younger dude turns 1.  
## November
5th - The Eternals comes out - the second new Marvel property in just over two months.  
## December
17th - the FOURTH MCU movie in the back half of this year debuts- and it is looking to be the biggest Spiderman movie of all time.  
## "Sometime"
Both the Hawkeye and Ms Marvel series are expected to debut this year, but the month is not yet announced.  
Bennett, my younger son, will be crawling very soon, and crawling leads to walking.  
We'll sell our current house and hopefully have some money to throw at whatever needs it most.  
# Life Lessons You Learn Repeatedly
Do you have any things your brain simply refuses to learn? It happens to me from time to time. One thing that has cropped up a few times here in the recent few months is this lesson:
When you have a problem, and you can't find the solution, and you've Googled potential solutions and found them to be unworkable... make sure you also *Google the problem itself*.
This is a pattern that's hit over and over in my life. I have a problem. I think of possible solutions and try to implement them one by one. Each time I hit a snag in implementing the solution, I Google my solution idea. If that doesn't work I move onto my next idea for solving the problem. Do this a few times, find no solutions that work, and eventually give up on solving the problem... come back to the problem months *(or even **years**, in one case)* later, and decide "you know, I should just type the problem into Google rather than solutions. Lo and behold, there's some simple 2 minute fix I spent hours looking for, and months living without.  
The example of this that just happened. My wife and I want to be able to see each other's Google Calendars in the built-in Apple Calendars app on the iPhone. No matter how much we tried, though, the other person's calendar just wasn't showing up as an option. I investigated the obvious answers. I looked into sharing settings from both the Apple side and the Google side. I started thinking about workaround options, using a calendar forwarding system, or signing into each other's phones. Eventually, I gave up. Nothing was seamless enough to use while being easy enough to implement.  
Today, I thought to try again. Rather than Googling something like "Apple Calendar Shared Google settings" or "iPhone multiple Google Calendar accounts", I just Googled:  
`"shared google calendar on iPhone not showing up"`  
Literally the first Google result pointed me to this page, which allows you to tick a box to enable sync on a per-calendar basis. Ugh. 
# New Gillespedia Article Posted
I just published this article about the concepts of "Analog" and "Digital". It's the first in a series of somewhat interconnected articles I've been adding to over the past many months. 
# Top 5: Gillespedia Articles I've Started, but Not Finished (Yet)

## 5. Triangles

All about three sided polygons and trigonometry.
## 4. Information Encoding

An extension onto #3 below, wherein I talk about some data structures and the bridge between data & the real world and whatnot.
## 3. Intro to Data

A basic overview of "data". What it is. What it isn't. 
## 2. Databases

All about different types of databases and related concepts. Primary keys. Foreign keys. Facts vs Dimensions.
## 1. The Internet

Spoilers: not a series of tubes. I know enough about a lot of things to be dangerous. My application of the Feynman Technique, though, makes me want to dive further into the internet to wrap up an explanation in one awesome metaphor (about a library).

# Motto: Today was a two-fer

I was thinking recently about some of my favorite things I've ever created. This list includes (but is not exhausted by) the checklist of things a good person does every week, the old video scavenger hunts I put on with my friends in high school, the time log that I used to track every half hour of 6 straight weeks, and, most recently, the second-a-day video that has been a time capsule of my life for the past 7 months. 

These were all fantastical projects that took many, many weeks of preparation and execution. They took lots of energy and focus. The yielded some of the best results and the most fun experiences I've ever had in my life. They are all things I would suggest for anyone to do at some point in their life. There is also something else all of these projects and ideas have in common - they were all directly and blatantly **stolen**.

Well, adapted, maybe.

The list of things a good person does in a week - adapted from an [idea by Demetri Martin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=NzsEtafv-FA#t=346s) (who probably adapted it from [Benjamin Franklin](http://artofmanliness.com/2008/02/24/lessons-in-manliness-benjamin-franklins-pursuit-of-the-virtuous-life/).
The video scavenger hunt - adapted from an episode of Viva La Bam (I'm embarrassed to admit I watched that).
The time log - adapted from an assignment that was given to Melissa in college.
The second-a-day video - adapted from the video "[This is what Madeline did](http://vimeo.com/34874881)".

You could look at this as a bad thing - "Aaron, why don't you come up with an original idea every once in a while?". I would argue, though, that I have the capability to recognize good ideas and the courage to implement them in my own life.

I used to carry around a quotepad (play on "notepad"). That was a stolen idea from someone at some point in time. Forgot who. Now I just write down quotes on my phone.

If you see something someone is doing and you like it, maybe you should give it a shot.

Here's a picture, unrelated to the rest of this column:

![](assets/69-1.jpg)

# Top 5: Results from things I've adapted
5. I have been doing the Demetri List for 15 weeks. I average 98.25/175 tasks. There are way more results, but that's probably the big one.
4. The Scavenger Hunt Highlight Film - the best moments from all three years
3. The Time Log - I spent twice as much time doing the things I want to do and half as much doing the things I should be doing. Also, I spend about the right amount of time sleeping, but its distribution and consistency was horrible.
2. The first half of my 24th year (it has kept going, but I refuse to show a video that's over half done)
1. I'm awesome.

Posts about the current state of the Column 1) are not interesting, and 2) do not age well... but here's one anyway!

> [!warning]- Multiple Emails
> In transitioning to a new code base it may take me a bit to figure out how to **prevent** emails from going out... or having formatting issues. Who knows! Please bare with as I settle in.
# New Column
Hey! Things look different! 

Things actually probably look *worse*, if I had to guess what my average reader would think. But my previous codebase was essentially just a template I used verbatim. The new blog is *also* a template, sort of, but it's one that I can (and have) change to suit my fancy.
## Why
The move to the new code base allows me a ==less tedious== writing & posting process.
### Old Posting Process
![[458-3.png]]
### New Posting Process
![[458-1.png]]
## Why *Really*
I wanted *even more* ownership over my content & how it is presented. This new approach allows me to use [Obsidian](https://gillespedia.com/Obsidian), which has really started to replace Notion as my go-to app for where I want to spend a lot of my time. The new setup is essentially just a rehosting of my Obsidian Vault to the web + some customizations... but they are *my* customizations. I can actually get under the hood on this one.

Also the old method made images particularly tedious to include in my posts. This disincentivized me to using many images. The new method makes images no big deal and therefore more likely to be included, which I want.

# Analysis Analysis
To quote the first five words of my green notebook[^1]:

> [!quote] I love flowcharts and lists

That pretty well sums up my particular flavor of nerdom. But it’s not that I love those particular tools & techniques, it’s what they are used for that I love - climbing up the [Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom](https://gillespedia.com/Data%2C+Information%2C+Knowledge%2C+Wisdom+Pyramid#Wisdom) pyramid.

You take raw data, analyze it, and learn information. You encode that information into a digestible form and in the process it becomes knowledge. You do this often enough in a particular realm, and you grow wisdom[^2].

The tools of this trade are anything that helps you analyze, synthesize, represent, and generally play with data/information. **Lists** and **flowcharts**, though, awesome as they are, are not the *totality* of things in this arena. 
## Techniques & Tooling
When it comes to analyzing data, synthesizing information, and encoding knowledge, there are a wide variety of tools & techniques that I use. Here's a cross section of my current go-tos[^3].

| Technique             | Main Tool         | Prospective |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Tabular data          | Excel             | SQL         |
| Charts & plots        | Excel PivotCharts | Tableau     |
| Textual data          | Obsidian          | Python      |
| Freeform drawing      | So many.          |             |
| Flowcharts & diagrams | DrawIO            |             |
| Systems modeling      | No “Main”         |             |
| Ontology editing      |                   | Protégé     |
| Graph data creation   |                   | Python      |

## A Tool’s Errand
I'd love something that could do a nominal job at each of these things. Or figure out a process that goes between them fairly seamlessly. I think I might just be re-inventing Jupyter notebooks in my thought experiment.

> [!tip] An Omni-tool
> A pipe dream.

Basically Notion's "Block with Properties" approach, but not strictly hierarchical. With a very robust visualization engine that supports two-way binding of properties to graphical elements in the rendered diagrams. My "[[Semantic Canvas]]" Obsidian Plug-in is probably approaching the very *beginnings* of this sort of thing, but Obsidian is wholly inept at tabular data - which is a huge aspect of my imagined system.

![[458-4.png]]

A key feature that I think would tank this whole idea is[^4] my desire to mimic Obsidian's *"everything is just plaintext file in a folder on your computer"* approach. Making a system that enables *that* while also adding in all sorts of features on top of it is trying to shove "fancy but rigid" into a "simple and flexible" framework. Doesn't work. Also blocks would be individual files, and that would cause an absolute **explosion** of tiny files on your computer. Databases are a thing for a reason. 
# Top 5: Current Coding Projects
## 5. Omni-tool
See the section right above the Top 5. I'm not seriously looking at building this, but I needed a 5th thing to round out a "top 5".
## 4. Obsidian + PDW Connector
My [[PDW]] migrated from a particular *thing*, to be more of a modular *framework of things*. Obsidian could very easily be the data storage & presentation layers. I've not started actually writing this code, but I've figured out how I think it would work.
## 3. This Blog Move
This one is sort of *done* as of this posting. I did lots of massaging of data and built a couple of custom components for this blog move. 
## 2. Semantic Canvas 1.2
My Obsidian Plugin “Semantic Canvas” has been downloaded > 2000 times as of this writing. Some folks reached out and suggested new features, which spurred me to start developing them. 
## 1. Brief Mystery
My 2024 Holiday Puzzle box is titled “Brief Mystery”. It is coming along! The most fun to work on of the list, but also the one I’ve been touching the least.

# Motto: The ultimate Nexus of software and hardware.

Today, I write you two columns. A Windows flavor (below) and a Google flavor (here). This is the Google edition. If you are only interested in me as a person (mom) you might as well skip both of these columns, they are sparse on details about my life.


Google was supposed to have a grand unveiling event today in New York, New York; but hurricane Sandy decided for them that it wasn’t going to happen. When I heard the news, I was upset. That is why today, during my lunch break at work when I pulled up The Verge (as I do on a multiple-times-per-day basis) and read the headline “Google’s future now: LG Nexus 4, Samsung Nexus 10, and Android 4.2” I literally yelled a bit with excitedness.  The next hour, I read every single piece of literature on that website, on Google’s own Play Store (where I’ll be visiting soon, more about that later), and any other 3rdparty source I could find. Here’s the news and my impressions:

## Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean: Part Deux)
The upgrade from 4.0 to 4.1 brought a solid set of new features. Nothing like the jump from 2.3 to 4.0 – mind you, but still enough that I rooted my Verizon Galaxy Nexus to upgrade it the day of the announcement (more on this later). The jump from 4.1 to 4.2 brings to the table a slightly larger set of improvements IMHO. The highlights, from what I’ve gathered, are as follows:
·         “Miracast” – probably the most exciting of all the new feature sets is the one that you won’t be able to use right away. “Miracast” is the native ability to send video and audio to a remote client (read: TV) without wires. Here’s what this means: queue up a video on your phone or tablet, send it to your television wirelessly. Open up a game on your phone, the phone then becomes only a controller – the TV gets the picture and sound (basically, The Wii-U). This feature is like Apple’s “AirPlay” and Microsoft’s Xbox media extender – but better. It is an open standard. All third-party vendors can (and soon will) start supporting Miracast.
·         “Gesture Typing” – Think “Swype keyboard” meets “SwiftKey”. The NATIVE keyboard will now support the best features from both of the two best replacement keyboards currently available (read: the two keyboards that I alternate between). The video showing their implementation colored me very impressed.
·         “Photo Sphere” – you know on Google Map’s Street View how you can look in a full circle – up, down, left, and right the full 360 degrees? Android’s camera will allow you to take your own pictures using the very same effect.  The file format for these photos, btw, is plain old .jpg. Android is again showing us that proprietary technologies are not the only way to live.
·         Multiple user support  – Android tablets will now support multiple users, each having their own settings and their own applications. This is great news for families sharing a single tablet. Kids can have their own profile full of games and bright colors and pictures of unicorns, and their parents can have a separate profile for boring applications and pictures of a clean house.
·         Daydream, Lockscreen, and notable app improvements – “Daydream” is the feature I understand the least about, not having yet seen a video or read a solid review on just exactly what it does. It has been likened to a screen-saver that may or may not allow for some additional functionality. The Lockscreen (lock screen is officially one word, btw) now allows one to enter the camera or access widgets directly. I’m curious to see the logistics behind how this is implemented without sacrificing device security. Gmail and Google Now have both seen improvements as well. Gmail now allows for zooming (which it hadn’t yet done, for some reason) and Google Now will now (if you want it to) pull information such as flight number’s and package tracking numbers from your email to let you know information that’s relevant to you before you even ask for it.
All three of the new Nexus devices will have 4.2.

The three musketeers must-get-ers. [Photo Cred](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html). 

## The Nexus 4
The LG Nexus 4 is the successor the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (a.k.a. the phone I’ve had for the past year). It will ship with 4.2 and a list of impressive specifications, despite one glaring omission (read on) I am getting one as soon as possible. The specs & my impressions:

·         4.7” 720p screen – Android phones are big and getting bigger. This trend I am a huge advocate for because I am a huge advocate. I’m a big fan because I’m a big fan. I am larger than most individuals. My hands, too. This screen has been reviewed very positively by the only 3rd party individuals who have had the chance to see it in person, which is good enough for me.
·         1.5 GHz Quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor & 2 gigabytes RAM – “really really fast processor”. Faster is better. Nothing more to say.
·         8 and 1.3 megapixel cameras – the camera is reportedly an upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus’s lackluster offering. Admittedly, that’s not hard to do. I haven’t seen any first-hand shots from the camera, but I’m optimistic. Of course, for me, cell phone cameras have realistically gotten about as good as I foresee them needing to get.
·         Inductive Charging – Charging without wires? Cool! You still can charge with a wire, if you prefer.
·         Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, GPS – All standards across the mobile ecosystem, save for NFC. Apple hated all over NFC and set the mobile wallet revolution back several months by electing to forgo it with their most recent iPhone. This angered me. I’m a big fan of the technology.
·         2100 mAh battery – this is slightly larger than your average battery for smartphones these days. That’s good, but not excellent. There are definitely phones with larger batteries. But, this battery should fair a bit better than expected based of the next stat…
·         NO LTE & Limited local storage w/ no MicroSD – these are the catch, the “got ya”, the only things about this phone that leave sore spots anywhere in this announcement. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the true standard of 4G (at least in America). This phone’s fasted mobile connection technology is HSPA+ (that thing AT&T says is 4G but Verizon says isn’t, the reason they both claim to have the ‘biggest 4G network in America’). This seems like a completely bone-headed move on the part of Google, and maybe it is. But… maybe it isn’t. LTE is fast. It helps burn you through your allotment of data much quicker than any other cell standard. It also diminishes battery life. LTE is so fast that, for many people, it is overkill. I find myself switching off LTE on my Galaxy Nexus on a semi-daily basis to maintain battery and because, unless I’m streaming video over the mobile internet (which I rarely ever do), 3G is definitely fast enough for me. Google forwent LTE for 2 reasons: First, to keep the cost down (more on that next). Second, to keep the carriers out of the way. When Android 4.1 was released, I had to wait MONTHS before I saw an official update from Verizon. By removing LTE, Google is taking the power to delay this release away from Verizon or anyone else who seeks it. I would have gladly given up LTE for that update during those 3ish months. The relatively low local storage is a shame. It is worth mentioning, however, that I have 32GB of storage with my Galaxy Nexus and I am currently using less than 3GB thanks to Google’s excellent cloud integration. The lack of expandable storage is a bummer for which I offer no justification or marginalization.
·         $299 (8GB) or $349 (16BG), unlocked – this phone will sell unlocked for the same price that I paid for a Verizon-subsidized Galaxy Nexus. For those of you who don’t know phones, that means you can make this phone your primary phone for $300 without having to wait for an “eligible upgrade”. This also means that you can buy it with no cell service at all and use it strictly as an overly-fancy  Android-flavored iPod-touch-like device. This price is shocking, I don’t understand how it can be so low. Seriously.

## The Nexus 7
The Nexus 7 is no-longer new, but today, there were announced 2 new variants: 32 gigabyte and the 32 gigabyte+mobile data. I’m not going to do a spec-analysis of the Nexus 7 because I have already done that on a couple occasions. Despite already having the original $200 8 gigabyte variant, I will be getting (a new) one as soon as possible (more on why later). The Nexus 7 is still an unbelievably cheap, unbelievably great tablet. The 16 gigabyte version: $200. The 32 gigabyte version: $250. The 32 gigabyte+mobile connection version: $300 (brief reminder: The lesser-impressively speced iPad Mini is debuting at $330).

## The Nexus 10
The last major announcement of the day was the first full-sized (read: about 10 inches) tablet in Google’s Nexus program. It does away with the Android 3.0-like arrangement of the notifications bar and app drawer; and with that, gone are the days of a phone and a tablet looking any different. The Nexus 10 has a back-facing camera, ultra-super-dooper high resolution screen, and is thinner and lighter than the most recent full-sized iPad. The Nexus 10 has impressive specifications all the way around. I will not be buying one, however, because I’m not crazy and I don’t need 7 inch and10 inch tablets. If I were to buy a 10 inch tablet today, though, it would definitely be this one. I am going to skip out on the detailed specifications for now, because I’ll likely do a head-to-head someday soon that will go down that path and this column is mega-long as-is.

Now, you might ask, “Why are you replacing a LTE phone that’s less than a year old with one that doesn’t support LTE?” which is a valid question. More obviously you might ask “WHY ARE YOU REPLACING YOUR NEXUS 7 WITH A NEXUS 7?!? THAT’S LIKE, THE SAME THING, BRAH.” Let me tell you why:

When you have the hookups, you use them. Back when I worked at a movie theater, I saw movies for $1. I watched a ton of movies that summer. Back when I worked at Blockbuster, I rented a ton of movies. I have a new hookup.

Soon I am going to do my end-all (at least temporarily) review of the technological offerings from Apple, Microsoft, and Google. They will be put head-to-head-to-head as an overall technological ecosystem solution. Mobile, miniature tablet, regular tablet, laptop, and desktop offerings will be directly compared, along with some additional thoughts and other things to consider. This will be the ultimate comparison, and will likely one of the longest columns I’ve ever written (a record previously held by either the California visit or THIS one).

With that, I am off.

# Motto: What Would Clint Eastwood Do?

Randall Munroe is the newest addition to my list of heroes. He is a former roboticist for NASA and programmer. More notably, he is the soul creator and writer of the webcomic XKCD. The comic frequently focuses on math, science, engineering, language, and general nerdiness. He puts out three new comics a week, every week, and has done so for almost 7 years. I have been a huge fan since I stumbled across XKCD three years ago. He is brilliant. If I could have any job in the world, I'd pick MythBusting. But if I got stuck writing my own webcomic like him, I'd consider that a solid second place finish. I doodle. I make jokes. They are even funny sometimes. I should give it a shot.

One tiny tiny tiny example of his insight I just stumbled across: back when the original Droid came out, he made [THIS](http://xkcd.com/662/) comic. It's a criticism of gadget obsession on the surface, but that's not the part that intrigues me. The part that intrigues me is the alt-text, where he comments on the Droid's 265 pixels-per-inch screen density and how important that metric was. He did this during a time when pixel density was not a common selling point in phones. This specification has only been advertised since the debut of the iPhone 4 and its "Retina Display". He realized, before any of the advertisers (and probably many of the engineers) that pixel density is EXTREMELY important for displays that we commonly look at from less than an arm's length away. Seems obvious, but a lot of people missed it (kind of like how, right after the original iPhone came out, companies tried making competing phones with smallerdisplays. Seriously, there were quite a few. Seemed obvious to me at the time that that was a dumb plan).

If anyone was looking to get my a present for any sort of anniversary of my being born sometime soon, I might suggest starting [here](http://store.xkcd.com/).

Anyways, beyond XKCD...

I have done some thinking about digital rights management (DRM) and technological patents lately. First off, tech patents are completely out of hand. The fact that apple got the sale of my phone temporarily banned because my phone had a same basic functionality is entirely ridiculous. Patents, in my very non-professional opinion, are there to keep people from stealing your hard work and hours upon hours of tinkering to make something function by swooping in at the last moment and copying the final design. They are NOT for preventing someone from doing their OWN hard work and tinkering to create something similar. What is going on in the tech industry right now is insane. It would be like if Bayer said, "okay, we patented a pain reliever in a pill; so we own that. It's our thing now" and then every other company who makes any sort of pain relievers has to pay them. It's stupid.

Moving on to DRM and the way things SHOULD be done (this isn't specifically about DRM I suppose, but it is related):

In a better world, media content would bought by the story - not by the item. If you bought a physical book off Amazon.com you would also have instant access to the Kindle digital version of that same book. If you bought a DVD or Blu-Ray movie, you'd have instant access to a version of that movie in the cloud. Unfortunately the standard is, "if you want it like that, you gotta pay for that version of it". Even the "DVD with Digital Copy" thing they tried doing (still are doing?) is usually bogged down to one service or a limited number of devices. When the zombie Apocalypse happens and I'm one of the only people left to reclaim the earth, I will see to it this system gets implemented. Then all will be right.

Closing notes: The new Spiderman movie was better than the first Spiderman movie (if not for the main actor alone)... and I am well on my way to accomplishing some of my fitness goals. Huzzah!

Welcome back one of my favorite recurring topics!

# Tech Ecosystems: 2023

Technology is integrated almost every aspect of everything we do in our everyday lives. It's everywhere around us, physically attached to us[^1]. Technology is supposed to make our lives better and easier. Sometimes it succeeds at that, sometimes it’s completely overwhelming. 

A recurring topic I have covered over the past ten years on here is the technology ecosystems of the day. I find it fascinating how these behemoth companies grow and evolve over time. What they decide to put energy towards and what they decide to avoid.

Here’s my thoughts on where we are at in 2023.

Image [Credit](https://learninginvestmentwithjasoncai.com/2022/01/23/fundamental-analysis-technical-analysis-on-mega-cap-faamg-stocks-facebook-amazon-apple-microsoft-google/)

## Facebook

It’s amazing to me that Facebook is where it is today on the world’s stage. This huge thing that billions of people are using, but also in the most trouble of fully imploding of anything I’m writing about today. If you told me 10 years ago that Facebook would have just shy of 3 **************billion************** people on it, *and* that it was struggling to maintain relevance… I would not have believed you. 

Facebook isn’t even the most relevant thing *at* ~~Facebook~~ Meta, it seems. Even if you, like me, are not be a “monthly active user” of Facebook, chances are good you regularly interact with *something* they own - Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and/or Oculus. 



**Facebook wants to be there when you are hanging out with your friends.** 

## Amazon

Amazon is synonymous with buying things on the internet. I have had 4 orders from Amazon over the last 4 weeks. Meanwhile the last time I bought something online that wasn't from Amazon was… I don't even remember. Amazon made a name for themselves being “the worlds most customer-focused company” and it paid off. Their “Prime” membership is, for many (most?) sort of like paying taxes. It’s become just a part of living. 

Amazon is more than just shopping, though. They’ve got the obvious side hustles: Alexa and Prime Video. What’s more, they’ve got their servers running a surprisingly large proportion of the internet. When Amazon Web Services go down, there’s a pretty solid chance it will seem like everything around you just stops working. [See this pretty entertaining article](https://qz.com/2099940/the-aws-outage-shows-the-internet-relies-too-much-on-amazon). The reason for that is that they were among the first to realize they could take the hassle out of managing web servers and databases, and decided to make that easy.



**Amazon wants to handle all the tedious logistics of your business, so you don't have to.**

## Apple

Apple is winning, both on the global scale and on a personal level. They are the largest company in the world, and they won me over after a number of annoyances perpetrated by Google. I just got my first Mac computer (more on that later) and it’s already *awesome*.

With the **very successful** transition to utilizing Apple-designed & Apple-fabricated chips in their laptops & desktops, they are just absolutely *dunking* on the competition. Apple is what every other company on this list wants to be: wildly successful across multiple markets and loved by its users. 



**Apple wants you to have the best, and to pay them for it.**

## Microsoft

The prodigal son. The first company I was consciously aware of for making technology stuff. Microsoft made its money on licensing its operating system, then ensured that its operating system was the de facto standard operating system by churning out the absolute king of office application suites. I think it’s not exaggerating to say that Microsoft Excel is in no small part responsible for the overall success of Microsoft.

They very nearly lost everything they were capable of losing during the Steve Balmer era. If you don’t know what that is, think about it as the “Windows Phone, Windows 8, Zune” era. When they replaced Balmer with their current CEO, things suddenly started looking up. Excel was now available on the Mac and in the cloud. They were happy to go where their customers were, rather than forcing them onto a new platform. This ensures their survival.



**Microsoft wants to be the lynchpin of your business.**

## Google

Google is *nearly* synonymous with “the internet”, and they don't seem positioned to lose that status at any point in the near future. It was my favorite company for the better part of the past 15 years. They had such an incredible mission, and an incredible business model. They gave everyone super human abilities, essentially for free. You suddenly have easy and ready access to the answer to any general-knowledge question. You’re never lost again. You have the ability to collaborate on a document in real time. 

Google is *also*, however, so incredibly afflicted with whatever the business equivalent is to ADHD. They get excited about an idea. They say “HEY EVERYONE! GOOGLE PLUS!” then give up on it. “HEY EVERYONE! GAMING IN THE CLOOOOUUUUUD!” then decide Stadia isn’t worth maintaining. Other things they never actually gave up on, but haven’t put any effort into - like their Google Health platform that’s roughly 3% as good as Apple Health. 



**Google wants to give you everything it can, for free.**

# The Radar Chart

These non-scientific radar charts illustrate my subject view of how involved each company is trying to make its money. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8A6R9UTJ6wteT0AYLqDJ2FUHDi2YpCB9-aOnPEq75naBnTildSXISwQBvxp_Yn0FC1QUtGDtWHxfgS6WuTSdWC6x4K5UImQUxRBg7Gqb-BZUyGCloU7dLUg46g56_ANPEd-FwlW2rpg1fkokKWWctT9Ag=w555-h456-no?authuser=0](assets/429-1.jpg)

Making this chart was the primary reason I wanted to write this Column, actually. It’s completely made up and somewhat arbitrary, but represents how it seems to me each company is spending its energy in hopes to move their bottom line. 

There are some fascinating combinations here - like, for example, Microsoft. They are heavily invested in running your business on-premise software, they want to run your business’s cloud, AND they want to be the gaming console you use to pwn noobs. Facebook has always been depended on advertising, but is moving into the consumer hardware and gaming spaces with the “Quest” VR headsets. Amazon wants to make a killing being the backbone of every transaction you make online, but also they’re cool giving you some side-hustle-ish benefits like Prime Video. Apple wants to sell everything you want to buy to run your technology on. Google has no idea what it wants. 

Here it is in table form:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8Cij50KDxnPJeS3xHq_4wLeu_AkgrYQwNigPmiLGPJU1RZU37_SjaVT608_ETft9lR6ThxMmMcWpy6ALgHwy6SatPHcxNttfW2zd4Zc-JDV-HAFzJZrK7zKkpqp9EJHwIU_JnCAgXbp8JWrvDnAeZioCw=w818-h553-no?authuser=0](assets/429-2.jpg)

Note: I left some blanks where technically I shouldn’t have, like Amazon’s “Prime Gaming”, because… well… it’s not competitive.

# Gaps in the Ecosystem

## YouTube

Why is there no real competitor to YouTube? How weird is it that Apple’s announcement videos are hosted on YouTube? Facebook hosts short form videos, but there isn’t really a general “browse”, or the ability to perform general searches for things like “how to change the oil on a 2011 Ford Escape”.

## Facebook’s IAAS

IAAS is “Infrastructure as a Service”. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all will happily let you build web applications and host them in their datacenters. Apple hosts the App Store and enables developers to create and publish apps utilizing consumer devices… but it sure seems like Facebook should offer developers some form of paid product. Maybe they do and I’m just ignorant.

# Mac Mini

I got an M2 Mac Mini. This is my first Apple-made traditional computer; and it completes my full transition to the Apple Ecosystem[^2]. It’s brand new. This is literally one of the very first things I’m doing with the machine, so my perspective on it will evolve over time.

Its incredible how *different* everything feels on the Mac. Also how the Mac does **NOT** feel like *“the simple computer”*. MacOS exposes so much more in-depth stuff than Windows 10 does. I wanted a context menu option to open a folder in my code editor. To do that, I created a script in the Automator app and added it manually. 



# Top 5: Things I Can't Make (yet)



## 5. Vector Art

I have all the necessary equipment, I just haven't wrapped my brain around using the applications to make art.



## 4. Games Development

Proper video games, that is. I've never played with Unity, Unreal, or whatever else there is. 



## 3. 3D Animations

This is interesting, but holy cow it's intimidating to get started. Seems like the kind of thing you could spend 3 weeks on to make something that looks like it was made by a 5 year old in an hour.



## 2. Fine Art

I've never been good at painting. My drawing skills are amateurish (and sometimes not even that good), and I've never even been aware of an opportunity to make a sculpture.



## 1. Music

This takes talents I simply don't have.

# Motto: Nerds rule the world.

The other day I hopped on the elevator at my apartment/condo complex and something statistically unlikely happened. Two more gentlemen followed me in, both of which were going to my floor, neither of which was accompanied by the other. First off, I would estimate that I ride the elevator by myself 80% of the time, with 1 other person 10%, with 2 other people 5%, with more than 2 for the remaining 5%. So, already, we are sitting at a one-out-of-twenty circumstance. No big deal. I won’t get into the fact that all of us were guys (12.5% chance of that; or possibly 25% depending upon definitions). I was going to the 5th floor of a 16 floor building. The bottom 2 floors don’t have housing. The top floor only has one or two high-rollers on it, so I’ll count them out. Assuming an even distribution of residents within the building, the chance of the first passenger following me living on my floor is 1/13, or ~7.7%. The chance of the second passenger going to the same floor is the same. To combine multiple independent instances of a statistical trail, you multiply them. So, it was a 1/13/13 (0.6% chance) occurrence. Multiply that by the original 5% estimate for the number of fellow passengers and you wind up with a 0.03% likelihood of said event. That’s 1 out of 3330 elevator rides. If I rode the elevator 6 times per day (a decent estimate), this would happen once every year and a half. You might say, “why write about something like that?” Well, people with personal blogs nearly always write about their birthdays, and those happen more often than my elevator scenario. So. Why not?
It’s still not quite as weird as the time I got on the bus at KU with 24 females and 3 males. Using a binomial coefficient, that happens once out of 45886 bus rides. That was ZANY.   Today I grew 3 additional chest hairs (chest hairs, if you didn’t know, are my standard unit of manliness). I cooked bacon for the first time. It brings me great shame to admit that I made it through life for 24.34 years without cooking bacon… but I can now proudly claim that streak has been struck down.   This is another weird column. This one is nerdier, though.   Speaking of nerdy and bacon – here’s a relevant XKCD:   

![](assets/49-1.png)
XKCD: Stove Ownership
I worked out this morning. So, I don’t consider that graph exactly accurate in my case.   Today I watched 45 minutes of Ron Swanson monologues. He’s a character in the TV show “Parks and Recreation”, if you didn’t know, and he’s awesome. I’m a bit late to the “I love Ron Swanson” game, but I’m here now and I do.   The next thing I want to talk about to round-out this nerd column: Videogames.   Since my recent videogame acquisitions (PlayStation 3 & Android console emulators), I have had a recent resurgence of appreciation for them. My girlfriend is going to be gone for ~6 months here pretty soon. So, it’s time for videogames.

Google (or at least a small sub-division of it) has made its first foray into the world of gaming with a really interesting game called "Ingress." The word "Ingress" is defined as "a place or means of access, an entrance." Given my (admittedly limited) knowledge of the game and the situation surrounding the game, this works on at LEAST three different levels. I'm definitely all for words or phrases or symbols that work on multiple levels... it's one of my "things". Beyond the brilliant name, it is a brilliant and new concept for a game. It takes videogames from something you do alone in your room to something you team up with strangers to do in the real physical world. The more I learn about it, the more it intrigues me. For those who are interested: [The Ingress Introduction Video](http://youtu.be/92rYjlxqypM). It also has a nifty symbol and some really interesting user-made artwork, surrounding said symbol(s) and the two factions in the game... like so:

(this image is lost to time)

The overall symbol and the symbols of the two factions... As symbolic metaphors, I prefer eyes to keys, personally.
Lastly, looking at a few different “Top {whatever number} videogames of all time!” lists, I have put together the following Top 5(s).

# Top 5: Videogames I’m looking forward to playing through 
5. Bioshock – PlayStation 
4. Earthbound – Super Nintendo 
3. Portal 1 - PC 
2. Drake’s Uncharted (the whole series) - PlayStation 
1. Chrono Trigger – Super Nintendo

# Top 5: Videogames I have played through and suggest
5. Hitman: Absolution (I liked it) 
4. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 
3. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (call of duty 4) 
2. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past 
1. Portal 2

The quote today is pulled from a backlog of my favorite friend quotes of all time that I have saved on my computer.

Motto: :-(  
  
21 hours ago I walked into a theater to watch one of the most anticipated movies... ever. The levels of hype varied from source to source - but all were looking forward to seeing it.   
  
I was going to write a big long review of Batman V Superman, but honestly, there are so many reviews all over the internet that I couldn't possibly contribute anything _new_ to the conversation. Instead, I'm mostly going to focus on the trailers, then have a Top 5 disappointing things & Top 5 not disappointing things.  
  
The following video will contain all the spoilers for Batman vs. Superman:  
  
  
That's the 2nd trailer Warner Bros released for Batman V Supes. It's essentially a 3 minute version of the entire movie, presented basically in the order in which it happened, missing only small amounts of action one, arguably two plot points.  
  
While we are talking about trailers getting people excited at the expense of them enjoying the movie later on...  
  
Here's the 3rd trailer they released:  
  
  
This trailer is slightly less spoiler-ey, but commits the second-worst cardinal sin a trailer can commit: it shows the climax of the movie. In this case, it shows Batman's awesome fight sequence. When I saw this trailer I thought "oh sweet! Batman is going to kick butt the whole movie!" Little did I know that the first 20 seconds of this trailer are basically just _all of the cool parts_ of the only sequence Batman has like this... and it's at the very end of the movie.   
  
Trailers should give you a feel for the tone of the movie, and optionally tease the plot. They should leave you wondering "gee, what happens in the rest of this movie!" Basically, they serve the same purpose as the first act of a story... so they should be composed primarily of the first act of a movie. What they should absolutely _not_ do is show you not only the climax, but ALL of the COOLEST parts of the climax. They shouldn't say "okay, so this happens, then this happens, then this happens, then this happens, then the movie is over. If you enjoyed this trailer, there's a longer version at your local cinema!"  
  
The trailers for Batman V Superman _really_ did the movie a disservice. I don't think it would be a "good" movie for anyone who hadn't seen the trailers, but not seeing them certainly would have helped.   
  
That's just my opinion.  
  
Regarding the #3 disappointing thing in the upcoming Top 5 - here's the picture to go out on:

Side note - you may notice the quotes in my posts are higher in quality now. That's side benefit #73 of my new job. Funny people saying funny things.  
  
Top 5: Not Disappointing Things about Batman V Superman  
5\. This movie addressed the chief complaints of Man of Steel head on  
4\. The fight sequences were pretty cool, on the whole  
3\. There were some very great visuals  
2\. The opening scene, following Bruce Wayne during the events at the climax of Man of Steel, was fantastic  
1\. Like everyone else, I think that Ben Affleck was a great Bruce Wayne & Batman... and Henry Cavill could be a great Superman, given some better writing   
  
Top 5: Disappointing Things about Batman V Superman (ACTUAL SPOILERS AHEAD)  
5\. Batman V Superman was 2 1/2 hours long, the Batman versus Superman fight scene was 2 1/2 minutes long. Batman's fight scene was great, but I'd already seen it.   
4\. Lex Luthor was interesting, but not really _Lex Luther_. No other characterization of Lex Luthor I've ever seen has he acted so... crazy. He was a very Joker-y Lex Luthor. That's not his character.  
3\. The movie feels like a setup for the Justice League moreso than a movie. The introduction of the other Justice League superheroes was awkwardly presented, and really _really_ weirdly placed in the movie. Marvel's "after the credits teaser" is great, DC should have done that.   
2\. Batman and Superman both kill people. That's a huge deal to some people.  
1\. They crammed a TON of otherwise great storylines together, presenting terrible, half-baked versions of each. Given that this movie is supposed to be setup for a long-running DC canon, they have to play in the world that this movie lives in. They can no longer use Doomsday. They can't do a proper "death of Superman" storyline. They can't give us a Batman V Superman fight with more meaning & substance. They have to deal with a crazy Lex Luthor. They killed off Superman's best friend without even mentioning his name. This one movie kinda sucking has implications that will last for years (or until they reboot the franchise again).

# Motto: Change is Necessary for Growth


I got tired of white text on a black background. What you see now is what I'm going to go with for the time being. It's not perfect. It's not what I had envisioned; but what I had envisioned is either not possible in Blogger or possible but really really difficult to pull off.

All the old posts I've ever written are on the left. I have a link to my YouTube channel up above. This change is only somewhat halfway done. I wanted to take the blog and make it a little more multi-faceted. Give a page for drawings. A page for poetry and prose. 

I don't actually know what "prose" constitutes. I wouldn't know what prose was if I read it. I wouldn't stop and say "oh, this must be prose". It's one of those words you use that you only know via its context.

Just Googled the definition of "prose". Turns out I've been writing prose all along... so I guess it wouldn't get it's own page. 

All in all, I'm interested in expanding the scope of this blog into something that's more "website" like than "blog" like. The problem is that's not what ***Blog**ger* is good for; and I like Blogger. 

Maybe I'll get a Squarespace domain. It's $8/month. I don't know if I can justify that cost in my head... yet.

I am now using AIO Wireless as my wireless service provider. AIO is a new provider, a subsidiary of AT&T with a unique focus on simplicity. There are no contracts. There are no overages. There are no fees. So far, I'm liking the service and I'm very optimistic about my continued experience with them.

# Thoughts on Apple's WWDC Announcements  
Apple's annual software developer's conference happened recently. Historically I'd be a *little* excited about their conference, but, since I switched teams roughly two years ago, this event has become **very** exciting. This year it did not disappoint - especially as someone who came from Android not too long ago, and would consider getting a Mac to replace my 6 year old desktop whenever it finally explodes.

## Android and iOS are the Same  
Most of the headline features of the forthcoming iOS 14 are *straight* out of the Android playbook.  
- We're getting home screen widgets.  
- We're getting the ability to hide apps we don't use.  
- We're getting the ability to set a default mail client and browser.  
Honestly, these were the only meaningful differences between the standard, day-to-day operations between running Android and iOS.  

Android die-hards will argue with me that the lack of the "back" button is a meaningful difference, but I  don't miss it. **Every case** in which "back" was actually *useful* on Android you will find one on iOS - usually as a button in the top-left corner. The "back" button on Android existed as a crutch to try to "get out of" screens your phone got into that you weren't really sure what else to do with. Sometimes pressing it would help, sometimes it would do nothing - which leads to a bad user experience. The other use for the "back" button was as a means to take out your frustration when the phone got slow and laggy - and that's just not a thing that happens on iPhones. Again, this is coming from an Android enthusiast.

![[394-1.png]]
## Things I'm Excited For
I'm extremely excited by the return-to-widgets. Hopefully this greater focus and emphasis on widgets will spur a more "first class" approach to widgets by developers. They have been a second-class citizen of the iOS ecosystem, and they never graduated past that on Android. Apple have the chance to correct some of the bad behaviors that crept into Android widgets (constant refreshing drains battery, and the refresh process usually was a visual distraction). I am 100% committed to figuring out a way to have a widget displaying my Data Journal events.  

The Siri Shortcuts (a.k.a. just "Shortcuts") app is getting new and expanded capabilities. Additional actions and, more importantly, additional automation triggers are going to revolutionize the ability to use your phone as a self-tracking, goal-killing modern human.

## Where Apple Slam Dunks on the Competition
The biggest announcement of the day was Apple's commitment to transitioning to their own silicon for MacOS. The iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch have been using Apple-built chips for years now. This is in large part why those devices get **so much performance** out of such a small package for such a long time. Apple tunes the hardware to meet the needs of the software - and it builds the software to intentionally exploit the  capacities of the hardware. This means that future MacBooks will have literal all-day batteries - and much better performance. Also - the common architecture will lead to a better, more consistent ecosystem of apps.

## What's Stopping "All in on Apple"  
- I still use Gmail. iCloud email is likely never going to supplant my Google email that's 10+ years old.
- I still use Google calendar. It works fine for my calendary needs. Although the lack of integration into Shortcuts is annoying... it does integrate with IFTTT.
- I use Todoist for tasks. The Reminders app seems pretty legit... but I need easy access to my tasks from a Chrome window.
- I use Notion for notes. Notion is incredible. Apple Notes isn't anywhere close to what Notion does.
- I primarily use Chrome for browsing, but honestly Safari doesn't bother me any more. 
- I use a Nintendo Switch for gaming. The App Store has a lot of great games, I'm sure - but I like Smash Bros. 
- I use Windows for my most heavy-duty computing needs, which is basically just video editing and heavy multitasking.  
Honestly, the thing that's stopping me from going "all in on apple" is primarily the fact that I have no access to anything Apple for 40 hours a week.

# Unrelated Thoughts
## Breakfast
Let's set the record straight: Breakfast is the *least* important meal of the day. You can easily skip it without causing yourself major problems. As a matter of fact, the "standard" breakfast foods are usually high in carbs and low in nutritional value. They may give you a temporary boost of energy, but will leave you with less energy than if you'd just eaten *nothing at all*. "Intermittent fasting" is essentially just[^1] a fancy name skipping breakfast, by the way. I'm not saying I skip breakfasts and I'm not saying that you should. I'm saying it's not important - it just has a good publicist.

## Time Blocking
My 30 Day Challenge this month was to institute Time Blocking. Supposedly, it's one of the **best, most useful** productivity techniques that exist, according to a lot of sources I've read. The basic idea is that you block out a slot of time on your calendar to work on a given task. You do *nothing* other than work on that task during this time. You also are meant to have the task finished by the end of the block. This means that you're not distracted, you're working deeply, and you're not able to let a task that should be done in 60 minutes take all day because you're being a perfectionist.  

**It turns out I suck at it.** I have not really had a single successful time block. I haven't figured out how to make it work. I just... I still get distracted. Or I don't start on time because I'm in the middle of something. Or the circumstance of the day supplant my ability to focus elsewhere. I want to try that again.

Motto: This Line Doesn't _Really_ Need to Be Here.

  
I was going to preface this post with an explanation of "thought experiments", but why reexplain the wheel?   
  
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought%5Fexperiment):  
  
_A **thought experiment** or **Gedankenexperiment** (from [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%5Flanguage "German language") considers some [hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"), [theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory"),[\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought%5Fexperiment#cite%5Fnote-1) or [principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle "Principle") for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. Given the structure of the experiment, it may or may not be possible to actually perform it, and, in the case that it is possible for it to be performed, there need be no intention of any kind to actually perform the experiment in question. The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question._  

Before I get into the content of my experiment - I want to give you a bit of background:   
  
I recently moved. Everytime you move, no matter how much stuff you have, you will inevitably think **"_why do I need all this crap?!?_"**.   
  
That question fits in line with a ton of themes from my life (see the quotes for a brief list) that combine to form a much more fundamental question:  
  
**"What are the bare essentials that you would actually have to have to live a comfortable, happy life."**   
  
Answering that question is my experiment. Note that the question is not "what are the bare essentials to _live._ This isn't a survival scenario-type question. What do you need to live out _your version_ of a happy life? Here's a brief version of my answer:

| A quick diagram I made, not representative of the list, but something to look at.                                                                                            |

  
* 1 small studio-type house, about the size of a railroad car
* 1 motor vehicle, parked in your house with everything else
* 1 toilet
   * Toilet paper & plunger
* 1 shower
   * Body and 2-in-1 hair soaps
   * 2 bath towels (I don't like using damp bath towels)
* 1 sink
   * Hand soap & towel
   * Dish soap & brush
* 1 oven/stove, one or two burners would be enough
* 1 refrigerator
   * 2 Nalgene bottles (so you can always have one in the fridge)
* 1 couch, on which you can sit _and_ sleep
* 1 desk, on which you can work _and_ eat
* 1 ottoman, to use for leg propping, sitting, and storage
* 1 small and 1 large version of the following:
   * Bowls, plates, glasses, Tupperware
* 1 large pan, pot, and baking tin
* 1 spoon, 1 fork, 1 knife
* 1 bicycle
* 1 messenger bag
* 2 pairs of pants
* 3 pairs of shorts
* 7 pairs of underwear
* 7 shirts
* 1 pair of boots
* 1 pair of running shoes
* 1 medium-to-high end laptop
* 1 external monitor, which doubles as your television
* 1 smartphone
* 1 multitool
* 1 box of GoPro-related stuff
* 1 box of medical supplies & toiletries
* 1 tool box
* 1 box of camping equipment (I like camping more than I let on)
* Ongoing gas, electric, water, internet, and smartphone connections

That is a slightly condensed version of the full list (which goes down into exact medical supplies and toiletries, tool box components, camping box components). It contains several things nobody really _needs_, but I'm confident it isn't missing anything I couldn't live without.
  
  
So, what are the things _you_ need to live the kind of life you want? Why do you have anything else?  
  
Top 5: Obvious Things I Could Leave Off My List

5\. One of the Nalgene bottles or bath towels  
4\. The bicycle or motor vehicle, depending upon where I'd live  
3\. The GoPro stuff. Nobody _needs_ a GoPro. But I really like making videos and I really like my GoPro.  
2\. The External Monitor.  
1\. Really, everything but the camping stuff. I could get by with that for a while.

Motto: You can probably just stop reading.  
  
This post is not for anyone. I wanted to write it, though. TL;DR - I read two books, one was good, one was not. Also - you should look to see if your local library has an app that you can get audiobooks from. Ours uses an app called Axis 360, and since I've discovered that my reading has skyrocketed. It's really really great.   
  
I recently read Broken Angels by Richard K. Morgan, the sequel to his first novel Altered Carbon. This Column is a review of that book... spoiler free-ish until the bold warning line. The Top 5 and quote are spoiler-free.  
  
I came to it by way of watching the Netflix series Altered Carbon. It opened my eyes to strong scifi, which I didn't know I liked. I've always been a fan of superhero stuff, which in a way is science fiction; but I've never been more than a casual fan of Star Wars, and I find Star Trek pretty unapproachable on the whole.   
  
Altered Carbon introduces a couple of pieces of new technology, and then sets the story in a world that deals with their implications. Those pieces of tech mostly boil down to the ability to digitize human consciousness & put into a little storage chip. This chip can be implanted into an unoccupied body, and suddenly the person on the chip now is alive again with a new body. This is the main concept of this world. There are a few other developments, such as human-like Androids, cybernetic enhancements, and a mode of faster-than-light travel capable of sending small payloads incredible distances by slipping into some dimension we can't perceive. Also there's mention that aliens exist and have surpassed our technology millennia ago, but for the most part aren't around anymore from what we can tell. That bit doesn't get much traction, though. Again, the main concept is the ability to pull the mind/consciousness/soul out of the body and the ability to make copies of it.  
  
Both Altered Carbon and Broken Angels follow the life of Takeshi Kovacs, a former member of an elite Navy SEAL/Green Beret-like fighting force called "Envoys". Takeshi's Envoy life is only a pretext to these novels. Neither of them take place during span of time.  
  
Altered Carbon is a story where Takeshi Kovacs is brought back to life in a new body on a planet he'd never been to before (Earth), to solve a murder mystery of an extremely powerful 400+ year old man. The man who hired him was the man who was murdered. He was brought back to life via a remote backup of his consciousness & clone of his body. The story is about Takeshi figuring out who killed the man. It's entertaining. It's interesting. The show and the book are similar enough to say if you've experienced one there's not much reason to experience the other. I enjoyed them both and I'm glad I watched and read them, respectively.   
  
Given the fact they are making a second season of the show I liked, I figured it might be fun to read the second novel in the trilogy before the show came out before I watched The Falcon take over for Rick Flag.  
  
Broken Angels takes place 30 years after Altered Carbon, but that doesn't really matter. Takeshi Kovacs is in a new body, but that doesn't really matter. Without getting into spoilers (yet) the story takes place during a war being fought with great corporate influence on a remote planet. Takeshi is told about a great archaeological discovery, and enlists to go help recover the discovery in the name of one of these corporations. That's the basic story.  
  
I would go so far as to say that's almost the _whole_ story, though.   
  
Nothing happens in this book. Not really, at least.   
  
The things that DO happen seem dull and unimportant. There are scenes in the book that seem like they were put there just to tick a box saying "yep we have that now", but have no implications to the overall plot.  
  
It's weird because I like the setting so much. I like the style. I like the main character. I like the world they're in. I like the little details here and there... I just don't think it was a good story.  
  
It was like if a bad script was given to a good screenwriter. Stepping back from the pages to look at the overarching narrative... it's just boring. I got 3/4ths the way through the book before I realized what I was reading just WAS the book, and not a setup for the book yet-to-come. I can't say much more without getting into spoilers, which I do briefly want to talk about.  
  
I hate to say I can't recommend Broken Angels to anyone. Reading reviews online, I'm not in the majority... but I do agree with the one other person I know in real life who read the book. It's just... not great. See the Top 5 for some GOOD things about it.  
  
**SPOILERS FOR BROKEN ANGELS BELOW THIS LINE**  
Alight. So specifically, here's THE entire book, boiled down into a \~3 minute read.  
  
Takeshi Kovacs is fighting as a mercenary on a planet he has no ties to in a war he doesn't really care about. Some guy he once knew tells him about an archaeological discovery of a Martian portal that leads into deep space, where there's a Martian spaceship, full of Martian tech. Takeshi goes AWOL from the war, rescues an archaeologist who opened the portal before, and teams up with a dude from one of the corporations so he can hire a band of (now dead) soldiers to help him go dig up the site. At this point we're about a quarter into the book.  
  
They go to the site. **The archaeologist spends the second and third quarters of the book trying to open a portal while everyone else just sort of waits around.** SOME things happen, but none of them are really of any consequence.  
A nuclear weapon goes off in a nearby city... but we don't have any connection to that city and the bomb's effects are mostly just a slow radiation poisoning of everyone.  
A grey mass of nanotech weaponry is discovered... but it's mostly inert.  
Some dead bodies are discovered... but who cares because an A-bomb just went off so of course there are dead people around.  
This half of the book sandwiched in between the first and final quarters is incredibly boring and slow.  
  
The last quarter of the book they open the portal and go through it. They then do a chapter's worth of exploration around the Martian ship, which was cool. The ship has a sort of self-defense mechanism that makes people want to kill themselves, Bird Box-style. Takeshi knocks most people out before they kill themselves. The merry band is rescued by Takeshi's old war troupe... but they decide they want to torture to death one of Takeshi's new friends. For some reason Takeshi decides this isn't cool and decides to kill literally 100+ military elite soldiers in span of about 3 underwhelming pages.  
  
That seems like the end of the book. But _then_ there's a chapter at the end that is reminiscent of the "HERE'S WHAT WAS GOING ON THE WHOLE TIME!" chapter in Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban... but the loose ends it ties up were all so uninteresting I forgot they even happened. Basically we find out the archaeologist realized killed everyone in her first expedition to the site after she realized the Martian ship was a war ship and the weapons tech on it would be used to create new superweapons. Takeshi realizes it right at the end, and decides "meh who cares." I couldn't agree more. That's the book.  
  
There are almost no new concepts introduced in this book. The only ones I can think of are the portal to outerspace... but they already have faster-than-light travel for small things. So that doesn't seem significant. Also the nanotech weaponry... but it doesn't do anything in the book aside from being vaguely threatening.  
  
Very underwhelming.  
  
Top 5: Things I DID appreciate about Broken Angels  
5\. The book is very different from its predecessor. We aren't getting a Dan Brown same-novel-every-time-but-with-different-details situation.  
4\. I still like the world-building.   
3\. I still like Takeshi as a character.  
2\. ...  
1\. ... :-(

Motto: Liberty and Monarchy, that's my Free King Motto

  
Because I sorta work in the industry, I feel the need to say the following contains information sourced only from public news and my opinions garnered from public news. My job does not afford me overwhelming insight on the future of consumer-facing television landscape. This will all be wild speculation using made up numbers to illustrate a point I would like you, the reader, to consider your stance on. The economics of television work out like this:  
Millions of customers subscribe to a basic cable package that gives them 100 channels for $50/month. Let's say that consumer XYZ watches somewhere around 10 of those channels in any given month. So, that she is wasting 85-90% of the money she's paying, right?   

[![](assets/227-1.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3fGAob9H6Fk/VLCb2XYxAbI/AAAAAAABlLg/9ZjCC3cF2Go/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-01-09%2Bat%2B9.20.06%2BPM.png)

Couldn't she just choose to pay for only the channels she watches and save \~$45/month? 

[![](assets/227-2.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n3WNthkgkpc/VLCb2Xhtd9I/AAAAAAABlLY/8O6CGJzKJrI/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-01-09%2Bat%2B9.20.11%2BPM.png)

Ms. XYZ is saving $45! Huzzah!  
Wrong. Wrong for the simple fact that channels are not equally "valuable". You can't just say "well, I pay $50 for 100 channels, so that's 50 cents a channel. I only want to pay $5.00 for these 10 channels I actually watch". You can't say that for a couple of reasons - 1) that's not how TV plans are offered (as of right now), and 2) that's not how TV plans WOULD work if they WERE offered that way - not all channels would cost the same.  
What you'd end up with is a pricing structure based off per-channel demand. Channels like ESPN that receive MASSIVE viewership could afford to charge way above and beyond their 50 cents. You'd end up paying something closer to $15-$20/month, just for the ESPN network, if not more. They can afford to do that because there's millions and millions of people that would gladly pay that amount to get their 24/7 sports fix. Less popular channels couldn't get away with that, so you'd see Fox News for $10/month, Comedy Central for $5/month, and Discovery come out for $2.50/month. The pricing structure would range from \~$20/month down to around $0.10/month for some of the lesser-watched channels, like Cspan. So, let's look at consumer XYZ's cable bill:   

[![](assets/227-3.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ArQtizqpx5c/VLCb2XW7FxI/AAAAAAABlLc/1J8WqOlDjR0/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-01-09%2Bat%2B9.20.14%2BPM.png)

 Ms. XYZ is still saving $5! Huzzah!  
Only, that's not true either. Let's take a closer look at a pretend world where the TV model is "pay for only what you want to watch & watch everything you pay for". Channels like Cspan can afford to run off 10 cents per subscriber because of the vast number of subscribers that are forced (for lack of a better term) to pay for them. If we were to break out stations individually, and Cspan was no longer getting subsidized by the millions and millions of 10 cent contributions by people who don't actually watch it - it would have to charge those people who DO elect to pay significantly more to keep itself afloat. Let's say that only 1 out of every 100 people decide they like Cspan enough to pay for it. Well, in order to keep income the same, your price just went from $0.10/month to $10/month. Cspan just became a specialty. If you really want it, you gotta pay for it. The number of consumers is the supply-side of this equation.  
So let's revisit example consumer XYZ. She still only watches 10 channels/month, but now it's 9 "normal" channels and 1 "specialty" channel:   

[![](assets/227-4.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lrYV3cI26eI/VLCb2x1nQMI/AAAAAAABlLk/IsLnx6a5uTc/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-01-09%2Bat%2B9.20.18%2BPM.png)

Ms. XYZ is now LOSING $5/month. If you were to actually pay for all 100 channels, your bill would be astronomical, in the neighborhood of $400/month.  
So. There's one side of the argument. You're paying for the 10 channels you watch and getting the other 90 essentially for free. It's the side of the argument that the cable providers are making, and it's actually a pretty valid... if you assume that people would continue watching every channel they currently watch if they were forced to pay for them individually.  
Here's the flip side of that argument:  
You're no longer paying for the 10 channels you watch, and getting 90 channels for free. You're paying for every single channel. Mrs. XYZ watches the History channel, but only really one show on History. She decides that one show alone isn't worth $2.50/month for her. She is no longer a History subscriber. The same goes for TBS, Discovery, USA, TNT, and she usually goes out to watch sports anyway, so she no longer pays for ESPN.   
Here's XYZ's lineup now:   

[![](assets/227-5.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-06tWCU%5FswHo/VLCb3CrnG6I/AAAAAAABlLs/AldwrtkyfPI/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-01-09%2Bat%2B9.20.20%2BPM.png)

 Mrs. XYZ is now saving $22.50/month, but she has now 5 or 6 less shows that she's no longer watching. She's missing out! Woe is her, right? Is that right, though?  
Television can be a great thing. There's nothing quite like kicking back at the end of a long day and turning on cartoons on Fox. But television can also be a terrible thing. 100's and 1000's of channels enables habits of over-consumption. There's literally always something on. It's a contributing factor to a culture that lives a sedentary lifestyle, doesn't read, doesn't do much of anything beyond passively consume bland entertainment.   
If we were given a more traditional supply & demand style television system, TV would consumption become much more intention. Competition would cut out the crap. Television would lose some of their specialty channels. Some of them would just go away, some of them would find other means to deliver their content. Some people would be out of a job. There would be less things on TV that we'd watch "just because they are on". The television industry as a whole might take a slight hit, but that hit would purely be a reflection of a more efficient economic model. Most importantly, at a macroscopic level, I believe we would all live slightly better lives. That's my opinion. I could be wrong. I'm not an economist. I'm not a sociologist (I about wrote "socialist" here on accident). I just a dude who thinks about things sometimes.

  
Top 5: **Side Benefits of the A La Carte Model** 5\. All those stations with only one good show would go under, but the demand for that one good show could potentially bring it into one of the stations you DO watch. All the sudden, that one good show that everyone likes on the network nobody watches could replace that one show that nobody likes on the network everyone watches. 4\. Due to the above, what WAS on television would take a fairly dramatic upswing in quality. 3\. The lack of "I only watch it because it's on"-type shows would cause people to watch less TV overall. I think few people would argue that the average American watching less TV would be a bad thing. 2\. Paying for individual channels would likely open up additional options. TV on the internet would become much more commonplace. 1\. You pay for what you get, you get what you pay for. The economic system works at its most fundamental level. That's just satisfying on some deep level.

Motto: Shooter McGavin was in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation  
  
I haven't written much lately cause I've been busy.  
  
I rewatched Thor: Ragnarok. I think it needs bumped up even higher in my MCU ranking. Previously it was at the top of my "Upper" tier - it's been reranked to middle of the "Elite" tier, passing Spiderman: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor's response to all this:

Next post will certainly be a retrospective of the Life Tracker - as my 5 Year Anniversary of tracking happens in two weeks. I have a preview of that post right here:

The post after that will be me screaming for an entire post about how good Avengers: Infinity War was. I have a preview of that post right here:

I guess what I'm saying in this post is that most of what I have to say I'm not ready to say yet.  
  
Top 5: Things That Make Me Hip  
5\. I bought these fancy lad shoes

To set the scene: I'm watching a Star Wars with my wife while I write this. You might say "Aaron! Don't write a Column while you're watching Star Wars! Pay attention!" But I assure you, I'm only writing this during the prequel trilogy.  
  
Things have been very different since my recent career switch. I'm happy to say that things are better in just about every way. I am glad to go to work on Monday. I'm happy to be at work. I find myself enjoying _doing_ the work. I like the people. I like the routine I've developed. I'm very optimistic for the long term path my recent change has put me on.  
  
Samuel L Jackson is awesome in everything. He puts the "win" in "Mace WINdu".  
  
Also, Jar Jar Binks truly is annoying. I know it's completely unnecessary to say at this point... but this is my first time really getting to see how terrible he is first hand.   
  
I've gotten the chance to see a lot more of my friends lately. I'm a big fan of seeing friends. Here shortly will be Christmas vacation - where I will get to see _more_ friends and family. I couldn't be more excited about it.  
  
I was sick for a while. Then I got better. Melissa got sick for a while. Now she's better.  
  
My "Aaron things" are slightly more difficult to keep up with, given my new situation. I'm more mentally engaged at work. I've been doing a great job utilizing my time. I have less time to dedicate to writing, Life Tracking, and doing 30 Day Challenges... but it's a compromise I'm more than happy to make. Things are going well.  
  
Alright. I'm going to go back to watching full-time. I got tons of pictures to share. Check out below!  
  
Top 10: Things in My Phone's Gallery

Motto: Whoa.

  
Just to set the scene properly for your read through this post, this is a picture from this exact moment: 

[![](assets/171-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mW6PY0NPCDI/U3QgbAXD3KI/AAAAAAABRPc/76USHN7tDr0/s1600/IMG%5F20140508%5F115229.jpg)

Today is Thursday, May 8th, 2014\. I’m on a ship somewhere between Falmouth, Jamaica and Cozumel, Mexico. There’s some sort of vaguely mariachi and tropical band playing somewhere behind me. I am sitting on a deck chair overlooking the Atlantic (or the sea of whatever). Next to me is my wife of 5 days, reading the book “Wicked”. On my other side is an old lady in a sun hat reading something on a Kindle and her overachiever husband reading “The Art of War”. I haven’t been on the internet for 4 days. That’s a record, so far as I know, since the first time I've had internet access (or, at the very least, since the first time I've had a smartphone). I am writing a post on the only laptop I've seen this whole trip - my Chromebook (who ever said you can’t do anything on a Chromebook without internet access was mistaken). I am happy, worn out, a little more sweaty than I’d prefer, maybe, and just a bit sunburnt… but I’m not complaining. I wouldn't change a single thing about the past 6 days if you gave me the chance.

--- everything below this line was written after the honeymoon -----

  
[This entire paragraph is a link to the \~70 pictures I have selected from the hundreds of photos we took over the course of our honeymoon. You should look at them in order, they are captioned with that intention.](https://plus.google.com/photos/103862168806820638349/albums/6015321836271238289?authkey=CPCplPWjqZLBzwE)  
  
Here's a brief rundown of the honeymoon:  
  
**Sunday May 4th**  
  
  
[![](assets/171-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fDQsMhsjCnU/U4NprEd8tlI/AAAAAAABWTw/F%5FVi66cGS2k/s1600/P1040330.JPG)

  
After a full two hours of sleep, Melissa and I take a shuttle to the airport. As per usual, we are in the terminal way way early. Neither of us are terribly tired despite the lack of sleep and the exhausting day the day before. I think our bodies were operating in emergency mode. We boarded our first flight at 7am, then hopped from KC to ATL, then from ATL to Ft. Lauderdale before boarding the ship at 6pm. Traveling sucks. After 11 hours spent being herded like cattle, jammed into one-size-fits-all airplane seats, and being held up for a couple of hours in the seaport while trying to board the ship, we were pooped. Your body can only run on adrenaline for so long.   
  
  
[![](assets/171-3.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZJXJNLeeJz4/U4Nr1i7kOsI/AAAAAAABWT8/RdCgO6hNCJA/s1600/IMG%5F20140505%5F202503.jpg)

  
The ship was immediately overwhelming to the senses. It was like an upscale shopping mall in its interior cavity. Lights everywhere. Stores. People everywhere. Everything was super nice. I was really impressed in particular with the lighting. The ship just seemed to glow. Beyond that though, all the little details were astounding. Nothing was done out of pure utilitarianism. Everything had a little panache.   
  
  
[![](assets/171-4.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4rv3zF1Ln2Q/U4Ns6nz9jFI/AAAAAAABWUE/PvgBSrHb4Zw/s1600/P1040340.JPG)

  
We went up to our room, it was great. The ceiling was just tall enough that I didn't feel claustrophobic. The room had a porthole to the interior of the boat. We overlooked central park. The room was big enough to spend a decent amount of time in without going crazy, but not big enough to really let you hole up without cabin fever.   
  
  
[![](assets/171-5.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RKeT0faqfHw/U4NzPnZUT-I/AAAAAAABWUc/OfBHD7K7b1s/s1600/P1040353.JPG)

  
After we saw the interior of the boat and our room, we went for an aimless walk about the upper decks, just to see what we could find. The upper decks did not disappoint. They were just as lavish as the interior halls of the ship. The first few days of the ship were all in part spent exploring the ship. It was awesome.  
  
  
[![](assets/171-6.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ARROoAiJcMw/U4N0ho9YbrI/AAAAAAABWU4/EzqlnaHnDgI/s1600/IMG%5F20140504%5F175630.jpg)

  
The last thing we did was check out the main dining hall. I've been to some fairly fancy places in my day; this was right up there on the list of the fanciest places I've ever eaten. The best part was this: everything on the menu was already paid for - you could have anything you wanted. You could have seconds of anything else you wanted. We had a full 3-course meal almost every day we were on board. Oh, and the food was awesome.  
  
**Monday May 5th**  
  
[![](assets/171-7.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xdlz6vvsBS0/U4N6DR2HbSI/AAAAAAABWVU/D9YBfMrEThA/s1600/GOPR3461.JPG)

  
We start off the second day at the less fancy, buffet style dining hall. Our second day was spent at sea on our way to our first excursion. We had only two plans for the day.  
  
  
[![](assets/171-8.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vZjGkeJnVlQ/U4N8UqJUBRI/AAAAAAABWVc/v4lBj7EdVo8/s1600/GOPR3473.JPG)

  
Plan #1: Make plans. We sat down on the Solarium deck bar (one of 42 bars on the ship) with a list of excursions and picked out things we were interested in. I think Melissa had me drink some extra bar beverages, because I signed up for a couple of things the next day that were very uncharacteristic of me. We'll address this again shortly.  
  
  
[![](assets/171-9.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NicGBFt5UFw/U4N90oFYI9I/AAAAAAABWVo/XDbdpAqSf7w/s1600/GOPR3488.JPG)

  
After we made plans, we relaxed on the boat to really unwind some of the stresses from the heavy travel day the day before. We laid on the top deck. Hopped in one of the jacuzzis overlooking the ocean.   
  
[![](assets/171-10.gif)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P9fffAk36qc/U3ZQifUgYVI/AAAAAAABVCA/CnnZAJW-Z8c/s1600/IMG%5F20140504%5F223358-MOTION.gif)

  
The last thing we did on the second day (that I can remember, at least - it's been a few weeks) was catch the on board showing of "Chicago". I'd never seen Chicago. I'd never seen a musical put on by professionals. I'd never seen a show on a boat. I can now say I've done all of the above; and I approve. The show was great. The singing and dancing were amazing. There was a live band and about a dozen cast members (all of which looked like they spent a large amount of time in the ships fitness center).  
  
**Tuesday May 6th: Labadee, Haiti**  
  
[![](assets/171-11.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HpSZfSxEpok/U3q3Vry3nvI/AAAAAAABVdA/1N3mhYIuQLI/s1600/PANO%5F20140506%5F081019.jpg)

  
Our third day was spent in port at Labadee, Haiti. The panorama above can get seriously huge if you click on it - you should click on it. I took it from the boat before we left to start our day full of excursions. We went on 3 different excursions in Labadee. Compare this to the one excursion each we made over the other two stops and you realize how full this day was with excitement... but first we had to spend some time on the beach.  
  
  
[![](assets/171-12.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ScoVm39NF-o/U4ODp7mBSSI/AAAAAAABWV4/wKl4aq1eeLk/s1600/GOPR3511.JPG)

  
The beach, for me, barely registers in my memory because of what happened next. You see those 5 ziplines over Melissa's head?  
  
  
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5gD8on0ABms/U3TsOtSLZgI/AAAAAAABSiQ/ChSFcLPmvDQ/s1600/G0033793.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5gD8on0ABms/U3TsOtSLZgI/AAAAAAABSiQ/ChSFcLPmvDQ/s1600/G0033793.JPG)

  
The longest zipline over water in the world. You reach speeds of \~40mph as you descend 500 feet over the course of the 2600 foot zipline. I told Melissa there was a solid chance I'd pee the whole way down. I'm proud to say that didn't happen. Melissa and I both wore GoPros on our heads. Mine was taking timelapse photos, hers was taking video. That video (along with all the other videos from the trip) I will release to the world when it's ready.  
  
  
[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mvpn8eGkL0g/U3TQ7HWu4wI/AAAAAAABRnI/asW9Xa0uvrM/s1600/G0010134.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mvpn8eGkL0g/U3TQ7HWu4wI/AAAAAAABRnI/asW9Xa0uvrM/s1600/G0010134.JPG)

  
So, after the zipline is done there's surely nothing else Aaron would do that seems out of the ordinary, right? Wrong. Let's hop on the rollercoaster that goes down the same mountain you just ziplined off of. Yes, let's just do that. Sounds like a blast.  
  
(it actually was)  
  
  
[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-52Y0oU3emC0/U3TSitBYEOI/AAAAAAABRp0/Q9xF0wvCs-U/s1600/G0020227.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-52Y0oU3emC0/U3TSitBYEOI/AAAAAAABRp0/Q9xF0wvCs-U/s1600/G0020227.JPG)

  
Melissa's huge thank you to me for living outside of my comfort zone was to finish off our time in Haiti with the excursion aimed most at little kids - the inflatable aquatic park. I don't care that it was aimed at children, it was a blast. We jumped and climbed and swam and just had a great time for an hour. After we got out, we headed back to the boat for our first post-excursion nap. That wasn't the last thing we did that day, though.  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gKJDEntg5VA/U3Tz7Ycc8tI/AAAAAAABSzo/MSxvtoktOME/s1600/P1040396.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gKJDEntg5VA/U3Tz7Ycc8tI/AAAAAAABSzo/MSxvtoktOME/s1600/P1040396.JPG)

  
We went to the ship's casino. Melissa had never been to a casino before. I'd only been to one with my parents. We came in, quickly lost $40\. Then left. Melissa had one last thing she wanted to squeeze out of the day.  
  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JOz9cuNybRI/U3Tj8S0vFDI/AAAAAAABSQM/QL4QTpAjlb4/s1600/IMG_20140505_213257.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JOz9cuNybRI/U3Tj8S0vFDI/AAAAAAABSQM/QL4QTpAjlb4/s1600/IMG%5F20140505%5F213257.jpg)
  
  
We went to the salsa dance club on the ship. After Melissa realized just how inept I was at dancing salsa (which relies heavily on complex rhythms), we walked across the boat, by the Starbucks, to the trivia/karaoke bar.

After the intense day in Haiti, we woke up already docked in Falmouth, Jamaica. We were groggy and exhausted, but a quick breakfast and some seriously large coffees helped straighten that out. Our excursion in Jamaica started early, so we had to go fast. I took that GoPro toss shot just before we got on the bus to start our trip to Montego Bay.

The bus ride ended up being a little over an hour of Melissa and I learning to appreciate just how well off we have it in America. There's a shot of Usain Bolt's high school in the album that I linked to at the beginning of this post. I'd show that but I'm trying not to repeat many shots.

We rode a catamaran out into Montego Bay to a snorkeling site. We met a really nice couple and bonded over GoPro stuff. You can see his GoPro attached to the railing in the Autoawesomed GIF above.

The snorkeling was awesome. It was almost as good as the snorkeling trip Melissa and I took in Thailand (that trip was what convinced me a GoPro camera was worth the money, I still regret not having one on that day). I had a very surreal moment in the water. It was perfect. One of the few moments in life that you can really call "perfect". The picture from above was not that moment.

This picture is part of a large set of pictures that I very much liked that immediately followed the snorkeling. I wanted to include it to represent all of its sister pictures.

We took a quick tour of the Jamaican marine life before going back to the boat. There's a picture in the album I linked to above of me touching a jellyfish. So, check that out, too.

We finished the day off on the ice. I didn't fall! Neither did she! That means we win!  
  
**Thursday May 8th**

Thursday was spent at sea. Honestly I don't remember much about Thursday. We were exhausted from the adventures of our previous two days. We lounged on the decks a lot on this day.  
  
  
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eBJUrR3HWbM/U3TqFyTGQRI/AAAAAAABSdk/8C7SAKlBMLg/s1600/P1040467.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eBJUrR3HWbM/U3TqFyTGQRI/AAAAAAABSdk/8C7SAKlBMLg/s1600/P1040467.JPG)

  
We also took part in a battle of the sexes competition (which the guys totally won (and cheated at). It was fun!  
  
  
[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n6_bfYfPRJE/U3Tyf46eFWI/AAAAAAABSwk/OhefPIZ3crY/s1600/G0064096.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n6%5FbfYfPRJE/U3Tyf46eFWI/AAAAAAABSwk/OhefPIZ3crY/s1600/G0064096.JPG)

  
This picture was taken from a huge set of photos we took to make a timelapse of the sunset. We sat on this deck for an hour and a half to two hours. I got angry when tons of people showed up to take pictures of the sunset, but the video still turned out pretty cool. [You can watch that video right here.](http://youtu.be/5VYZTzYOuvM)

Oh and there was a disco party afterwards.  
**Friday May 9th: Cozumel, Mexico**  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QCW-3oHRNYs/U3T6TfTgxoI/AAAAAAABTAI/hQZ2YgWPRl0/s1600/P1040478.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QCW-3oHRNYs/U3T6TfTgxoI/AAAAAAABTAI/hQZ2YgWPRl0/s1600/P1040478.JPG)

Friday we docked at Cozumel, Mexico for our excursion and some authentic Mexican food. We went on a tour of the Mayan ruins as lead by our awesome and very charismatic tour guide Cesar.  
  
  
[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZZXsm_Buyf8/U3Tyi-3bXLI/AAAAAAABSws/lWTTPwpCpeA/s1600/P1040479.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZZXsm%5FBuyf8/U3Tyi-3bXLI/AAAAAAABSws/lWTTPwpCpeA/s1600/P1040479.JPG)

  
The ruins were cool. Slightly smaller than I expected, but the tour guide more than made up for it with his passion and humor. The Melissa version of this photo is better. It's in that album I've mentioned a few times (I want you to see the album is what I'm getting at).  
  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dqxI-hDDqX0/U3TrgWkTbvI/AAAAAAABSgg/_U22aPMsCiI/s1600/P1040499.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dqxI-hDDqX0/U3TrgWkTbvI/AAAAAAABSgg/%5FU22aPMsCiI/s1600/P1040499.JPG)
  
  
After our tour of the ruins we stopped off at this awesome photo spot. Everyone on the bus piled out to take photos. Our photos were probably the best ones though.  
  
  
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B8g-im-tbrs/U3T0fi_zyBI/AAAAAAABS1A/utyLJKW-AYY/s1600/IMG_20140509_145444.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B8g-im-tbrs/U3T0fi%5FzyBI/AAAAAAABS1A/utyLJKW-AYY/s1600/IMG%5F20140509%5F145444.jpg)

  
Upon our return to the seaport, we had authentic Mexican food and beverages. The food was alright... but I'd still take Chuy's any day of the week. The beverages were good, though! El Sol! Jose Cuervo! Some swimming and relaxing on the fake beach. When we got back to the boat we were pretty much down for the count.  
  
**Saturday May 10th**

Our last full day on the ship was spent at sea. It started off with room service breakfast in bed (at no extra charge - seriously, cruises rock). This is a terrible picture, but it's the best we have.  
  
[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UFIzdOxUsPg/U3T8siDKweI/AAAAAAABTEo/Opn4toSXmQI/s1600/GOPR4043.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UFIzdOxUsPg/U3T8siDKweI/AAAAAAABTEo/Opn4toSXmQI/s1600/GOPR4043.JPG)

  
For our last day, we decided to take advantage of some of the ship's amenities that we hadn't yet done. We watched a show at the aqua theater where we got to hear some Q&A with the Captain.  
  
  
[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dfPvh3ZzAdM/U3T1u1Y5o8I/AAAAAAABS3s/P6EsWYBbRjo/s1600/GOPR4054.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dfPvh3ZzAdM/U3T1u1Y5o8I/AAAAAAABS3s/P6EsWYBbRjo/s1600/GOPR4054.JPG)

  
Melissa did the ship's zipline...  
  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kD_NtQ5ZS9o/U3TQX7C-CZI/AAAAAAABRmY/_EoB6TiYO6o/s1600/GOPR4249.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kD%5FNtQ5ZS9o/U3TQX7C-CZI/AAAAAAABRmY/%5FEoB6TiYO6o/s1600/GOPR4249.JPG)

  
...and the ship's rock wall.

Then we both got the chance to wipe out while surfing on the Flow Rider. There's some pretty hilarious videos from this experience. You'll see those in some later post.  
  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oRUhTyDZTyo/U3Tk69PJm7I/AAAAAAABSTM/9-gCRYWZ-g0/s1600/IMG_20140511_002430.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oRUhTyDZTyo/U3Tk69PJm7I/AAAAAAABSTM/9-gCRYWZ-g0/s1600/IMG%5F20140511%5F002430.jpg)

After one huge massive nap, we finished off the trip with another walk around the boat. Taking it all in for one last time.  
  
**Sunday May 11th**  
All good things must come to an end.  
  
This was a very good thing.  
  
Top 5: Most Recent Perfect Moments from My Life

10\. Senior year at KU, with Melissa, I take all my residents to go watch “The Avengers”. Nerding out with a crowd as it lived up to 4+ years of anticipation. 9\. Amy’s wedding, Sally and Jon dancing. 8\. In Thailand, Melissa’s professor’s husband, Lindsey, immediately understanding what I was doing when I told him I “needed Melissa alone for 10 minutes after lunch.” 7\. In Thailand, the next 10 minutes. 6\. My 25th Birthday party. The first time all my friends from every walk of life gathered in one place. 5\. The bachelor party, Ben explaining how you can mix a lime with a Corona without spraying it everywhere, immediate followed by him spraying Laura in the face. 4\. The wedding ceremony, Melissa reciting her vows. 3\. The party bus, Melissa by my side, all my friends from different walks of life singing the same dumb pop song and dancing. Directly across from us - Jon dancing. 2\. The wedding reception - the final song, Franz Ferdinand’s “Take Me Out” (which I will contend is everybody’s favorite song). Everyone dancing, while I bounced around with a GoPro on my chest. Part of the circle - Jon Dancing 1\. Snorkeling off the coast of Montego Bay, Jamaica - on our way back to the boat to wrap it up was a school of 50+ fish all swimming within arm’s reach, their movement filled my plane of vision. There’s probably a few other moments from the honeymoon that could/should be on this list - but this one was particularly cool.

# Motto: Like Before, but More

It's October. That means a few things - Halloween is coming, it's getting colder, and my second second-a-day video is already 16% done.

I was writing in my [Moleskine](http://images.wisegeek.com/raised-skin-mole.jpg) during lunch on Tuesday (the 1st), when I realized I wanted to try something big for October. A post came up the other day on [r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) about what really really tall weightlifters can and cannot do well. I learned a few things from reading that (for example, 6'2" is considered really really tall for some people). From that post, I moved on to articles aimed at weightlifting for the "vertically gifted". I decided that, with my diet, I hadn't ever given my body much of a chance. 

Here's what I wrote -

![](assets/120-1.png)

So that's my plan. The October Project: get Large. 

...and because I'm Life Tracking, I'll be able to see objectively how well I adhered to the guidelines.

**Day 0: 223 lbs**

![optimistic before photo](assets/120-2.jpg)

**Day 1 -**

- Calories - 3013
- Fats - 85
- Carbs - 454
- Protein - 183

**Day 2 -**

- Calories - 4088
- Fats - 147
- Carbs - 494
- Protein - 230

That brings us through today. Still haven't eaten out. Still haven't had caffeine. That's pretty cool.

There's a Google Engineer by the name of Matt Cutts who gave an excellent TED talk that I saw a long time ago. It's 3:27 long. If you have that kind of time, I suggest you watch this:

![this is a link now. Click me I guess.](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days?language=en)

The TL;DW of it is this: Try something you've always wanted to try for 30 days. That's long enough to evaluate how you like it, long enough establish habit, but short enough to be doable. When I stumbled across this video I considered trying it, but decided to forego in lieu of a different project: the first iteration of the Demetri List (the list of 35 things a good person does every week (which was later adapted to the list of 25 things I aim to do every day in the Life Tracker).

The October Project is me testing out the "try something new for 30 days" waters.

In other news, I was correct about GoPro announcing a new model, making my camera officially "old". It took less than a day before I decided to start throwing it around:

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE: this image is gone. :-(


# Top 5: Big Changes of the October Project, in Brief

5. Workout every weekday.
4. Eat 4000 calories every day.
3. High carb breakfasts, high protein and nutrient lunch & dinner.
2. Drink 2 gallons of milk a week.
1. Drink no highly caffeinated beverages.

Motto: **This Column May Set a Record for the Greatest Number of "I" Uses. Not proud.**

This Column is going to take a deep dive "Inside Baseball". Moreso than most of my other posts, I'm writing this for my own gratification. I'm going to write about the Life Tracker, it's history, and where I see it going in the future.  
  
After you move out of your parent's house and go to college it can be difficult to find a well-balanced life. Eventually, the school itself will provide a structure around which you can build a path to success (or failure, you're call). After college, there's work... for whatever reason, my life in the working world didn't lend itself to structure as well as my life in college. All the sudden I was 100% responsible for what I ate, what I did with my time, and what I spent this newfound income on.   
  
While that challenge is a great privilege, it was still a stressful time when I really REALLY realized what it meant. I felt like I had to keep track of these disparate things that happened in my life or else I'd wake up some day in a heap of trouble to find that something had really gotten away from me.  
  
I told my soon-to-be-fiance that I was interested in some sort of elaborate notetaking system. After listening to me talk about my needs, she suggested I look at Google Forms. So I did.   
  
Google Forms are essentially just surveys you can create, distribute, and use to gather data. Responses to Google Forms are put in an accompanying Google Spreadsheet. So I created a form I could bookmark and use whenever I found myself in a situation where I needed to track some action I did (eating, spending money, exercising, etc). That all got dumped onto a single Google "Sheet". It worked, the data was there, but it wasn't very pretty.  
  
Enter JavaScript.  
  
I had built some Macros in Microsoft Excel that did much fancier things than just "move data", so I figured there had to be some easy way to create something I could use to pull out the data from this one core dump sheet into separate, dedicated sheets. Turns out Google uses JavaScript and not the Visual Basic I was used to, so it took a couple of weeks to figure out what I was doing. The same day I finally figured out how to programatically place a value into a cell I had my first working prototype of what would over the course of the next month become...  
  
**Life Tracker 1.0**  
  
The first major version of the Life Tracker let me track money (every dollar), food (every item), exercise (every rep), and "Demetri Goals". Each of these four major facets had their own, dedicated sheet. I didn't use any 3rd party resources for anything. If I ate a hamburger, I pulled up my Google Form. If I did a workout, I pulled up my Google Form. If I spent money, I pulled up my Google Form. Each night before I went to bed, I pulled up my Google Form.  
  
I ran the Life Tracker that way with 75% success for a long time. I eventually gave up on tracking money. I had a hard time keeping up with that for some reason. Diet, exercise, and "Demetri", I did manage to track. After a year, I decided I wanted to put together my data and see what type of correlations I could find hidden in the data. I was interested in some questions that you couldn't answer looking at any one sheet.  
  
Did I eat more on days when I exercised?  
Was I more productive on days when I exercised?  
Did I eat more on days when I went to see friends?  
  
Turns out, this was difficult. Took me a month to pull the data part and put it back together in a way that made sense. I eventually answered those questions (slightly, slightly, and yes were those answers, by the way) and decided that I wanted to keep on doing what I was doing, but I wanted to do it smarter.   
  
I got zero value out of keeping the diet, exercise, money, and Demetri information on separate sheets. Also, I realized I didn't actually care about individual reps, individual food items, or individual purchases. I just cared HOW I lifted, HOW I ate, and HOW MUCH I spent. Also, I got very tired of entering data several times a day. I wanted to keep a journal of events about what kinds of things I spent my days, weeks, and months doing.  
  
**Life Tracker 2.0**  
  
The second (and current) major version of the Life Tracker did away with individual sheets. Analytics were built directly into this new "supersheet" (as it was referred to in the code). Now I could see immediately what my macronutrient ratio was in percents for the previous day. I also did away with homegrown data entry for money, diet, and exercise. I rely on Android Apps to do those things now. At the end of the day I just have to summarize my total calories, fats, carbs, and protein intakes each day. I still use Google Spreadsheets to do data entry, but now I'm only doing it once a day. It takes less than 4 minutes to fill out the form, then I'm done. I added in a journal for me to summarize my day in a few sentences.   
  
More recently, after I got my Moto 360, I added in sleep metrics. How much did I get? When did I start? I wanted to know if sleep duration would have any measurable impact on my performance in my "goals list" (formerly known as "Demetri list"). Also, I added a qualitative "how are you feeling" metric and a pedometer readout. Did my mood improve on days when I slept more/walked more?   
  
That's where I've been, and where I am today... but where am I going?  
  
**"Life Tracker 3.0" a.k.a. "Project Insight" a.k.a. "A Quantum of Selfus" a.k.a. "LittleBigData"**  
  
The next refresh is about to get underway. Like the transition from 1.0 to 2.0, I will utilize the my knowledge and experience to improve the efficacy of the system, while diminishing the effort necessary to keep it running. Here are my goals:  
  
Less reliance on Google  
I love Google, and there will still be a large part of it in the new system, but I'd like to cut reliance upon their systems for data storage (and possibly analytics). I'd like to be able to host my system on my own server.  
  
Automatic data entry  
Each night I pull up 5 apps: Chrome, LifeSum, Google Fit, Withings, and Sleep as Android. Chrome I pull up to do the data input, the other 4 I use to just pull the most recent data. The thing is, that shouldn't have to happen. I should be able to pull data for all four of these apps and have it put into the Life Tracker automatically. This could probably also be done for Mint financial tracking. I've seen some really positive signs for all of the above being possible.  
  
Not just me  
I'd like to build something that is adaptable and easy to use. Ideally, it could be something that I could just hand over to Joe Schmoe off the street and he'd be able to use it to track the stuff he wants in his life. If I de-centralize it (off Google's servers) then Joe Schmoe could use it 100% on his own machine if he were so inclined. \#privacyconcernsresolved  
  
Also on the "not just me" front, I plan on pulling in external information where it makes sense. My first idea for this would be tracking the weather. It could be interesting to see how rain affects my productivity, for example.  
  
Support for incomplete data sets  
I missed doing my daily survey this Thursday. Because Ia missed a day, I have to scrap the whole week. This means the bike ride I went on today won't show up if I'm looking for biking trends. I lost my trek up the Manitou Incline a couple weeks back because I didn't want to track food during a vacation. I can't just leave food blank, because it will skew everything. I am going to build in support for a "on days for which you have data"-type filtering.  
  
Refined tracking points  
There's a few things I'm going to change within the data. "How are you feeling" needs to be more clearly defined and needs to allow for truly neutral responses. Exercises shouldn't be limited to one-a-day and shouldn't be limited to the pre-defined types I used. I'll likely move to a tag-based exercise system. I did heavy, lower, cardio, and worked out outside. Also, I'd like to be able to tag days with events. I napped today. I also ate out for dinner.   
  
Also on this front, metatracking. When did I enter the data for each day? Given that I will open up the possibility for non-complete data sets, how complete is my entry log for a given week?  
  
Those are my goals. They come and go. I've been thinking about them for a few months now. I can't wait to get started.  

  
Top 5: Charts I Just Made from the Life Tracker

5\. My exercise goes through a rise/fall pattern every week.

3\. This is a spoiler for #1 - but it also shows how that month of Paleo affected my macros.

2\. Sleep by day of week. I like this one because it just shows that the data reflects things that are obvious.

Motto: Hey Google, tell me about my day  
  
I'm just going to post this as is - everything in italics is how my Posts start, before I fill them out with words.  
_Google Home. It's really really cool and shows a lot of potential. My wife was originally pretty skeptical, but she's come around on it quickly._  
  
_Black Mirror is a crazy, messed up, wonderful show. The Entire History of you is a perfect example episode - take a conceptual future, which is conceivably possible within my lifetime (and, realistically, I think very close to the direction we're heading) and show how or why we need to be responsible with it - because technology enables us to do so many great things while giving us a long enough rope to tie into a noose. Also how it explores the themes of constantly dwelling in the past or otherwise not being in the moment. About how you can sit and stew on something for forever, rather than dealing with it moving on with your life. Talk about the Google Home listening to each episode, too._  
_Life is good._  
  
_Facts vs. Truth & the editorialization of fact-based reporting by those with agendas. Talk about Ken Bone and how he's not perfect, but how he is not deserving of the skewering he got immediately following his surge of popularity. This isn't at all my only opinions on the subject, but it's a decent representation that's not tied politics (which I will always stay away from on this blog)._  
  
That's what the Column looks like before I flesh it out. Oh and here's a photo:

Motto: Matt Cutts

I've been lazy with the 30 Day Challenges lately. I'll admit that. But I have not given up on them entirely. They've definitely been in the back of my mind. With this post I'd like to start taking them more seriously again. Let's do a recap of how things are going so far: **January**  
**The goal:**Eat a Paleo diet & do CrossFit  
  
**How it went:**Way better than you'd expect.   
  
**What I learned:**  
I was too focused on "weightlifting" and not enough on actual _fitness_. Weightlifting is a huge part of fitness, but it's not everything - and I had forgot that.   
  
Also realized how much better I felt while eating paleo. I wasn't ever sickly feeling. Never gaseous. Never bloated. No "bathroom issues".  
  
Both of these experiences have had long-lasting effects. **February**  
**The goal:**Read 5 books  
**How it went:**I read 3 books. I picked a dumb month to do a quantity-based goal - February is short. Also I switched goals about 6 days in, which made it even shorter. Either way, I read 3 more books than I would have otherwise.  
  
**What I learned:**  
I should probably read from time-to-time, but I still don't prefer long-form reading as a leisure activity. I may pepper a book into my routine every now and again, but I'm definitely not going to be a habitual reader - which is a shame. **March**  
**The goal:**Write every day  
**How it went:**I wrote just about every day. It wasn't so much of a challenge, though. I write most days anyway. I put out a ton of Columns this month.   
  
**What I learned:**  
I realized just how outside-of-the-box you start to get when you force yourself to write every day. That type of writing is fun, honestly. **April**  
**The goal:**Run 50 miles  
**How it went:**Poorly. I ran 15 miles, almost all of which happened in the first week and a half.   
  
**What I learned:**  
Running much over a mile really flares up my back. Not good. **May**  
**The goal:**Enjoy yourself  
**How it went:**Really really well. I got married and went on my honeymoon. Resounding success, all around.  
  
**What I learned:**  
I didn't learn anything strictly because of this goal (although I learned a ton that month). This month was intentionally a cop-out. **June**  
**The goal:**Use a GoPro every day  
**How it went:**I used GoPros most days, but not every day.   
  
**What I learned:**  
Although I wanted to take better advantage of these awesome cameras I have, it's much harder to get a candid shot with a dedicated camera than it is with a cell phone camera... and I like candid shots.   
  
---
--  
  
_That brings us up to this month. I had planned on doing a "double down on fitness"-type goal, but instead I went with something a little more brain-related than body related..._  
  
---
--  
**July**  
**The goal:**Drop Windows, adopt Linux  
Goal 2 - use [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) every day to learn some Spanish  
**How it's going:**The original idea was to dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu, then use only Ubuntu for the month. After which time I could decide between Linux and Windows for good... but I accidentally managed to factory reset my Windows machine. So that's not how it is going down. Luckily, I'm very much liking the new Linux-based system and wouldn't go back anyway.  
  
The Spanish part is going well. I actually enjoy it. Melissa seems to be enjoying it more. She's done twice as much as I have.   
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
How to use Linux and how to speak some Spanish. Also, that I enjoy both things.  
  
---
--   
_What about the future? I've got it all planned out..._  
  
---
--  
**August**  
**The goal:**No Reddit. (Also, Facebook, Google+, other such time-zappers. See what things I might do to fill out my free time without the usual distractions.)  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Better things to do with my free time.  
**September**  
**The goal:**Work out 5 days a week... _before work_. Doing some pre-defined exercise routine (like 5/3/1, Strong Lifts, PHAT, etc)  
Part 2: Eat a macros-conscious diet  
Part 3: In bed by 10  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Which parts of this routine are sustainable. How I feel living such a health-conscious life. This one is arguably more difficult than the Paleo + CrossFit one was.  
**October**  
**The goal:**Is a secret  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Is also secret.  
**November**  
**The goal:**Spend no money (outside of bills and the groceries)  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
How much I can save, what things I can get away with _not_ spending money on, and how not eating out affects things.  
**December**  
**The goal:**Learn to music.  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
To music.

-- Those are subject to change. I might combine some easy goals, change order, or just change things completely. I just wanted to get something on the books. You have to know what your goals are if you want to accomplish them. That's one of the cornerstones of management.  
  
And I should know, after all, I'm a manager..,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motto: This is Shooting-From-The-Hip Poetry at Its Nothingest  
  
Before we start - expectations be framed.  
Each bits of this is self-contained.   
  
I've written a book.  
The main character was a clock.  
I gave him a tic;  
so th-this is how he would talk.  
  
Pet peeves with which everyone agrees:  
Slow drivers. Slow walkers.  
Loud eaters. Loud talkers.  
Pet peeve that's just for me:  
Using the flash at 100+ feet.  
Learn how pictures work, idiot.  
  
The price tag of the new iPhone is XS-ive.  
Yes I'm aware it's pronounced "Ten Ess" and not "Ex Ess"... but I'm just not good at making tennis jokes, love.  
  
Not all of these are going to rhyme.  
I cannot do that all of the time.  
They also might not fit in meter.  
Because I forget to check.  
  
Do things the right way & have a nice start to your day.  
Aaron's assertion, annoying as always:  
Be better by being bounded by burden.  
Cut corners cause cascading consequences.  
Don't dilly-dally. Do due diligence. Delayed duties drive detoured days.  
Easy.  
Far from fun, fetching funds for foregone food.  
Ugh this is tedious.  
Basically - better living through doing things the way they should be done. If you do stuff right the first time you don't have nearly as much trouble in the long run. I think that's basic dad-advice, but it's just now sinking in how important it is now that I'm a dad. Crap I forgot to rhyme-RHYMING WORDS! MIMING BIRDS! CLIMBING HERDS! TIMING TURDS!  
  
Enough of this.

Last week I knew I was going to have time to kill. I looked on the Nintendo eStore for cheap offline games for the Switch. I picked up a game I'd never really heard of called "Hollow Knight". It was $15\. Low risk.  
  
Since that time, I've played a ludicrous amount of this game. **It's incredible**. Probably up among my favorite games I've ever played. I really like basically every aspect of this game. Its play style. Its art style. Its atmosphere. Its aesthetic. Its difficulty. Its price. Its length. Never before in a game have I ever wanted to see what's around the next corner for so long. I've never played a game that's so experience-driven. It's downright beautiful in parts.  
  
I beat the game - and immediately decided to go back in and try to see what was in the areas I still hadn't explored. I finished the game at 76% complete... after 35 1/2 hours. Put that in perspective, I paid less than a penny a minute to have consistent entertainment and enjoy a great story that was at _least_ on-par with most movies/books/other games I've ever experienced... and I've went back in for more. Another 8 hours in - finished it at 100%. Holy cow.  
  
Top 5: Real Reasons Monsters Exist  
5\. Ghosts - somebody's thing fell of a table for no real reason & they decided their recently deceased relative who hated that particular thing did it. Also it's a vaguely threatening way to tell people to respect the dead. Careful there's ghosts around here.   
4\. Werewolves - Parents didn't want their children playing around in the woods at night. Careful there's werewolves out there that will eat you.  
3\. Zombies - Bury the dead & generally don't go around them because it's unsanitary. Careful there's zombies out there that will eat you.  
2\. Sirens - Boating captains and senior sailors told the younger and more homesick crewmates that their desire to go to shore and find beautiful women was actually just some magical force intending on sinking the ship on the rocks.  
1\. Vampires - Be careful who you invite into your house. Also parents didn't want their daughters to go be swayed by young attractive men. Careful there's vampires out there that will kill you and suck your blood.

Motto: Everybody Needs a Hobby  
  
I have put a lot of the three major resources into crafting a home gym. I'm proud of it and it's one my favorite things about my house... but it doesn't have any way to do cardio. Your standard fix to this is "buy a treadmill off Craigslist". My issue is, I've got crap joints and treadmills historically cause me problems after a couple of minutes. Also treadmills are large and generally not something I've ever been excited about. In my experience, rowing for a couple minutes is a better warm up than jogging, and a rowing machine tends to hold its value. Because rowing machines hold their value, [any one that's used and worth buying is incredibly expensive](https://kansascity.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=Rowing+Machine). That link isn't to a specific example, it's just a search of Rowing Machines in the KC area. I assume at any given point in the future you'll be able to click it and see I'm right.  
  
So, they're expensive, but they're also simple. A rowing machine is basically a seat with wheels & rope that offers some resistance when you pull it, then retracts back to let you pull it again. How hard could it be to make that? Why are they so expensive?  
  
Thus, for the past 8 months I've wanted to and tried (with varying levels of success) to build a rowing machine. My workouts have been missing a cardio component, not warming up properly has caused me to hurt myself on two separate occasions. I've got an engineering degree. I'm a problem solver. This is a solvable problem.  
  
Thus begins the Parable of the Rowing Machine.  
  
In my Life Tracker I first wrote that I "made rough plans for a rowing machine" on December 10th of last year.

That was 8 months ago. It's been mentioned 18 times since then.   
  
In order to get out of the hypothetical realm, I bought a bike from Goodwill. It was later that I found out that children's bicycles function differently than adult bicycles. Turns out when you pedal a kid's bike backwards it functions as a brake. Net result, when the rope started to retract, it just seized up entirely.  
  
So. I bought a second bike from a second Goodwill.   
  
Once I had to settle for a bigger bike wheel, I gave up on submersing the bike wheel into water. Given that water wasn't a possibility, I went with a friction-based dampener.

That worked okay.  
  
Until it broke.  
  
Turns out ropes like that aren't meant to be used for friction. Also it turns out that the best name in Rowing Machines "Concept 2" uses an air-based dampening system. Air is fluid. Water's a fluid. Fluid dynamics work. Basically I needed to turn my bike wheel into a bike wheel fan.

It was at that time that I found out that I broke my bike wheel. So there came a need for bike #3\.

Turned out, though, that the bike wheel being parallel with the ground cause the chain to slip off the teeth of the freewheel. Also - the bungee cord-based rope retraction system was limiting the stroke length of the row. So - I abandoned the self-contained, bungee-cord-based system. Built it back into the wall. Fan wheels. Weights for retraction. AAAAAAAAAAAAAND

5\. If I think of it, I can actually build it.  
4\. If I can think of it and build it, it won't necessarily work like I want it to.  
3\. DIY doesn't necessarily mean cheap.  
2\. Before spending a lot of resources on a project, ensure you've got a place for it.  
1\. Maybe just buy a pre-built thing.

# Motto: Hello Melissa! Hello Danielle!
  
This post is not for everyone. The first part is for everyone who's at all interested in this game I've been playing a ton for the past 10 months, but I wouldn't suggest reading past the line of hashtags if you don't already know Dominion. After that line I'm going to write in detail a review of Dominion and each expansion. **What is Dominion?** Dominion is a "deck building game" card game. It's probably more fairly called "THE deck building game", though, it really defined the genre. Deck building games (like Dominion) are similar to "collectible card games" (like Magic: the Gathering or Pokemon) - with a few key differences: 1\. You don't have to buy your own, private deck in real life by purchasing randomized expansion packs. 2\. Everyone plays from the same set of cards, so there is no chance that a person you are playing can do something that you couldn't also do in that same game. 3\. If your friend owns Dominion, then you don't have to. As long as Dominion is in the room anyone can play it just the same. Dominion itself was created by a guy named Donald X. Vaccarino. It was inspired by "Magic: the Gathering" (which I admit doesn't necessarily bode well for the game)... but it's less nerdy. I think. I've never really played Magic. Whatever, keep reading. 

Dominion is for 2 to 4 players (you can play with 5 or 6 if you really want, but it's less fun). There are \~17 stacks of cards in front of you. \~3 of these stacks are Treasure cards, \~3 of these are Victory cards, 1 stack is full of Curse cards, and 10 are kingdom cards. Most kingdom cards are usually Action cards, but are sometimes Victory or Treasure. Collectively, these cards are called the "Supply". All cards have an associated cost, which varies from card to card. Each player has their own deck, which they build by buying cards from the Supply. The object of the game is to have the most victory points when the game is over. You accomplish this by building a deck that lets you gain victory cards (which give you victory points) more effectively than your opponent.

  
That's a barebones description of Dominion.

  
The _beauty_ of the game, however, comes from the following:

  
\> Victory cards give you no benefit until the end of the game, while Action and treasure cards give you no points when the game is _over._ The challenge of the game is finding the most effective balance of both.

\> Each game of Dominion is set up using 10 Kingdom cards out of a set of a couple hundred. That means that you can play 22 quadrillion _different_ games... and each one might have its own "best strategy". There is no "one strategy to rule them all".
  
How you go about building your deck to best take advantage of the 10 Kingdom cards that you happen to be playing with is your choice. That's where the strategy comes in. That's the beauty of the game.  
  
**What is a simple game of Dominion _actually like_?**  

You sit across from your opponent. You analyze the Kingdom cards that you're playing with and decide on a strategy. You build out your deck by buying Action and Treasure cards from the Supply. As you go, you may realize your strategy sucks and change course. You may notice something your opponent is doing that's working really well and try to figure out ways to stop her, or incorporate her strategy into your game.

  
Dominion is awesome. I made the mistake just now of looking at the [Wikipedia article for Dominion](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion%5F%28card%5Fgame%29#Gameplay), which describes how to play it better than I was going to. Now I don't have the motivation.

[![](assets/192-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Np2lb0cTSHE/U-eyipz8X6I/AAAAAAABbJA/RZacGpvxKJo/s1600/%23192+-+base.jpg)

  
**Base**

The Base set doesn't necessarily qualify to be on a list of "expansions", but it's no different than them. It is full of simple cards that show off the game's core mechanics. The Base cards have no real theme beyond "simplicity". Games using only the Base cards are fun, but don't quite have the pizzazz that comes when adding in the expansions. Having said that, the Base game is full of very important cards and should be everyone's first purchase.

  
Because this is the first one, I'm going to take a moment and describe what I'm trying to do here. I'm going to give an overview of each set, then give my opinion on it, then break out each set's highlights and low points. I'm not listing the _best_ and _worst_ cards, but instead the most/least _interesting_ or _fun_ to play with. Everything in these reviews are my opinion. Also, before I go _too_ far here... even the WORST Dominion expansion would make for a pretty fun game. These range from awesome to just good.

  
Highlights:

\> Chapel - the master trashing card. The ability to remove cards from your deck changes the landscape of the game dramatically.

\> Gardens - the first Victory kingdom card. Opens up the possibility to win a game without buying a single high-cost card.

\> Throne Room - play an action twice. Sweet.

\> Witch - the first, most obvious attack people learn.

  
Low points:

\> Chancellor - this card is not worth its cost in most all situations.

\> Adventurer - the sole action card costing 6 in the Base set. The usage case for this card is limited. Too limited to justify its purchase in most situations.

\> Feast - nobody uses this card.

**Intrigue**

The first expansion, Intrigue, is the only expansion that came out with the necessary Treasure and Victory cards to play a game. It's lightly focused on "making choices", with several cards that have the players choose between different possible actions. If you're buying your first Dominion game I'd suggest the Base game over Intrigue. It's not my favorite expansion. I didn't realize how little I liked this expansion until I tried to pull together this next part.  
  
Highlights:  
\> Bridge - an easy way to buy lots more. Can work really, really well - or could do you nothing better than a plus 2 coins. Fun to play.  
\> Conspirator - when you manage to get a Conspirator chain up and running, it's awesome.  
  
Low points:  
\> Saboteur - it's too mean of an attack. You turn up your opponent's Province late in the game and Duchy pile is run out - that's a great way to lose a friend.  
\> Nobles - buying Nobles lets you turn cards over and over and over. It also happens to give you Victory points along the way. The all Nobles strategy is really good, which makes me not like it. It's self-synergistic, simple, and stupid.  
\> Minion - speaking of self-synergies, if you can manage to fill your deck with many Minions, you're sitting pretty... a little too pretty. Each hand you're playing several Minions, attacking your opponents, reaping money, AND letting you draw past your Victory cards.  
\> Wishing Well - another card that's just not usually good enough to warrant buying. It's a waste of a Kingdom card slot.

**Seaside**

The Seaside expansion introduces duration cards, whose actions last until your next turn. Although it's a very highly reviewed expansion, I'm not as sold on it. It's still fairly new to my collection 

  
Highlights:

\> Bazaar - I like this card. Don't know why.

\> Lighthouse - a way to stop attacks before they start. One that's better than the other one. One that's worth buying.

\> Island - when you learn what this card does, you immediately love it. Although I've had some troubles making it work in the past. It's still a highlight.  
\> Embargo - can make things interesting. The only card that I can think of that gives the user the ability to dissuade his opponents to go after obvious strategies, forcing a tough choice.  

  
Low points:

\> Tactician - the Tactician card essentially lets you throw away your current turn to have a doubly good turn next time. This is a good thing because, in Dominion, one _great_ thing is better than two good things. The problem is this: Tacticians card insists upon itself. It's hard to justify doing anything _other_ than play Tacticians, and, to make matters worse, it is awkward to work tweaks. 

\> Merchant Ship - it's overpriced. Not worth buying unless there just so happens to be a $5 card in the Kingdom.

**Alchemy**

Very few people will argue with my opinion that Alchemy is the worst expansion of Dominion. It introduced a new Treasure type, "Potions", and it has a heavy focus on a hand with tons of Action cards. The problem is that Potions are very inflexible _and_ that makes games involving Alchemy cards very inflexible. There are ALSO several cards that are extremely annoying to play with, making you shuffle, or count, or making your friend hate you. More on that in a second.  
  
Highlights:  
\> Apprentice - one of two cards that don't require potions to buy. So it's got that going for it. It's also got a very unique ability to draw a massive amount of cards AND it was given that ability in a not annoyingly good & obvious to use way.  
\> Vineyard - I like victory cards that afford you new ways to win. This one just so happens to make the Potion card a little less worthless in late game.  
  
Low points:  
This could go on for a while.  
\> Possession - you essentially steal your opponents next turn. You even use her cards. This card could easily be renamed "lose your friends". If somebody buys a Possession, maybe just quit.  
\> Philosopher's Stone - this is a treasure card that makes you count ALL the cards in your deck each time you play it! What a great idea! When somebody buys this, they will take an extra minute and a half every time they play it. Annoying.  
\> Golem - this card can be awesome. It can, in some edge cases, really _suck._ But in _most_ cases, what it does is make you flip through your deck ridiculously fast and shuffle over and over again. Annoying.  
Honestly, I could put almost every card that requires a "Potion" to buy. I don't like the Potion mechanic, and I'm not alone.

**Prosperity**

The set that was released immediately following what most people call the worst expansion just so happens to be the one that most people call the _best_ expansion. I might just agree with them. Prosperity introduces high octane cards, including new, higher value Treasure and Victory cards. Lastly, it introduces Victory tokens.

  
Highlights:  
\> Colony cards and Platinum. Melissa wants to use these every time. It adds options to how to win. Do you go for the bigger Colony win? Or do you end it quickly with the Province ending?  
\> King's Court - pick an action, play it three times. I used to not like this card because it creates swingy games... but it also creates some of the craziest situations in Dominion. King's Court, King's Court, Bridge, Bridge, Bridge. If you manage to have that hand, you suddenly find yourself with 10 buys, 9 coins (at least) and everything costs 9 coins less. You could in empty the Province pile yourself, in one turn.   
\> Monument/Bishop - Victory tokens are a good thing.  
\> Forge - remove the cruft from your hand AND get yourself good cards in the process. I really like Forge.   
\> Peddler - the action card that costs $8 - no $6 - no $4... it's interesting.  
\> Bank - make those coppers useful again!  
\> City - another card I've loved since the first time I saw it... without any good explanation as to why.  
\> Counterfeit, Loan, Hoard, Quarry, Contraband - treasure cards that do stuff are cool.  
  
Low points:  
\> Mountebank - this attack is a little too good, at least for the price. I'd have no problem with Mountebank if it cost $6 instead of $5\. There's a reason it's the top-ranked $5 card in [this list](http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/List%5Fof%5FCards%5Fby%5FQvist%5FRankings) since it was first released. It's too good.  
  
  
[![](assets/192-6.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H8L56XnvBM8/U-gpngHCr9I/AAAAAAABbMw/wje%5FkEuv45Q/s1600/%23192+-+cornucopia.jpg)

  
**Cornucopia**

The Cornucopia expansion was the _first_ expansion I got. So I'm admittedly biased. It is the expansion most people would point to as the second weakest expansion (after Alchemy), however I think it's actually a solid contender for being my _favorite_. It encourages you to differentiate your deck. It gives you benefit not just to buy the same card over and over again. I don't like strategies that revolve around buying up all of one card and spamming it every turn. Cornucopia rewards the style of play that I think is the most _fun._ I love Cornucopia. Also I like to pretend that the girl on the front is Melissa.

  
Highlights:

\> Menagerie - if you have a sufficiently differentiated deck, you will be rewarded. This is (perhaps inexplicably) my favorite card.

\> Young Witch - a cheaper Curser. Adding an 11th pile to the Kingdom. Adding more options. Also - it's perfectly named, given what it does.

\> Hunting Party - another card I've liked since the first time I saw it.

\> Tournament - winning a Tournament is like finding one last Christmas present under the tree that you didn't know was there.  

  
Low points:

\> Jester - this card is fine in 1 on 1 games. If you get 2 or 3 players, though, it becomes too good. I will nix it out of any game with more than 2 players.

  
[![](assets/192-7.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfdQ6-JzUlA/U-gpuC-S1WI/AAAAAAABbM4/xk7pwXo29-A/s1600/%23192+-+hinterlands.jpg)

  
**Hinterlands**

Hinterlands introduces cards that do something when you gain them. Hinterlands doesn't really stand out in any meaningful way. It's not a _bad_ expansion... it's just not really memorable. Get it, but don't rush.  
  
Highlights:  
\> Trader - when you gain a card, you may instead gain a Silver as a reaction. I like reaction cards who have a little more open-ended usage case. This is a defense against Cursers, or maybe a way to utilize extra buys without extra money (buy $0 Coppers, turn them into $3 Silvers). > Tunnel - another reaction card giving out money. If you discard a Tunnel, you gain a Gold. I've tried going all-in on this strategy before and whiffing big time. Still a fun card, though.  
  
Low points:  
\> Jack of All Trades - many people love this card. It does just about a bit of everything. It's interesting... but maybe a little too good. You can apparently just buy two of these, no other actions, and win fairly often.   
\> Duchess, Oasis, Nomad Camp, Mandarin, Farmland - these cards are all just... blah. They are okay, but I've never fallen in love with any of them. I've played hundreds of games of Dominion. Probably a couple dozen with each of these cards, yet I can barely remember what they do. They don't stick out in any way.

**Dark Ages**

Dark Ages is the largest expansion to Dominion. It introduced 35 new Kingdom cards (as compared to 25, or even 13, with the other expansions). The theme for Dark Ages is, in short, the Trash. Cards that Trash things (even themselves). Cards that can look through the Trash. That sort of thing. Also, Dark Ages introduced Ruins (a "less bad" attack type), Spoils (single-use Gold cards, basically), Shelters (a set of cards that you start the game with that are even less helpful than the Estates they replace), and action cards that aren't in the Supply, which must be gained through playing \*\*\*other actions. Dark Ages introduces lots of complexity. Many/most of the cards have a ton of text on them and take a couple of games to really wrap your head around. Highlights: > Cultist - Cultist is a Witch that gives out Ruins instead of Curses. The beauty of Cultist comes when you buy several of them - they chain off each other and allow you to draw massive hands, even after the Ruins pile runs out. Cultist is fun. > Feodum - a Victory card that gives points based off the number of Silvers in your deck. I love alternate paths to victory. > Count - pick one bad thing to happen to you, then one good thing to happen to you. It's a unique and, I think, inspired card. Low points: > Procession - pick an action from your hand, play it twice, then trash it and gain an Action card costing 1 more than it. I've never seen anyone use this effectively. It's in mint condition because nobody every buys it. > Mystic - plus an action, two coins, and the top card of your deck - if you can successfully name it. Weird combination of things. Rarely lives up to its cost. It's a non-terminal (provides additional actions) money-giver, so it's always a little useful, but it's just not that much better than a regular old Silver. 

  
[![](assets/192-9.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ouFDM9xZ%5F94/U-mF53970GI/AAAAAAABbQM/R6aSLL%5F7DeU/s1600/%23192+-+guilds.jpg)

  
**Guilds**

Guilds is a small expansion, like Alchemy and Cornucopia. Unlike Alchemy and Cornucopia, Guilds was never intended to be part of a larger expansion. Guilds introduces two new mechanics: Overpay and Coin Tokens. Overpay is an extension of the 'on-gain' ability from Hinterlands. Coin Tokens are such a basic idea, it's weird to think they didn't get added in until the 8th expansion. You taken a token that can be used up for a coin at any time. Guilds is the newest expansion (coming out after I learned about Dominion, actually) and it's the newest and last addition to my set. I'm still learning Guilds, but I really like it a lot. Highlights: > Baker - simple. Plus one card, one action, and one coin token. Also it starts everyone in the game off with a coin token at the beginning of the game, changing the opening buys (and thus the entire game strategy) dramatically. It's simple, yet intriguing. It's great. > Adviser - draw three cards, your opponent gets to pick one for you to discard, plus one action. I don't buy this card usually, but I like it thematically. Low points: > Masterpiece - it's essentially a Copper that costs what a Silver costs, but for each $1 you overpay, you get another Silver. Sounded super interesting at first until I realized, you could just BUY a Silver for the same price. So it's not worth it unless you're overpaying by at least 2, but by that point you are usually wanting to buy better cards anyway. It's got its uses, but they are edge case. > Herald - most of the time this card just replaces itself. In some cases, playing it could actually hurt you significantly. Doesn't seem worth the cost.

  
**Promo Cards**

There are 5 promo cards, Envoy, Black Market, Walled Village, Stash, and Governor. I don't own any of the promo cards for the sheer fact that they are hard to come by. You can only buy them from strange places and their stock is usually limited. The promo cards are what you would call "Exotic". They offer unique mechanics that you don't see anywhere else in the game. I'm have no plans to own any of these cards, and that's okay. I'm not going to do a highlights/low points because I don't own them and because they aren't really part of a set. Each one is their own individual thing.

  
The Top 5 for this Column is a list of the 9 expansions, ordered by their rating on Amazon. You'll notice that even the worst-rated expansion is still above a 4 out of 5 stars. Amazon users seem to penalize heavily the sets with few cards and promote Dark Ages for its extraordinary number of cards. Those are my observations. As for my opinion, I'd rate the expansions thusly: 1\. Prosperity (best) 2\. Guilds 3\. Cornucopia 4\. Base 5\. Dark Ages 6\. Intrigue 7\. Seaside 8\. Hinterlands this is a break in the list, I put it here because there should be more space between numbers 8 and 9\. 9\. Alchemy (worst) I like Dominion. I like Dominion so much that I wrote this big long huge post about Dominion. I like Dominion so much that I wrote out a pseudocode framework as to how I would go about building my own Dominion game for my own use. I like Dominion so much that it makes at least 6 appearances in my Second-a-Day video from last year. The irony of it all is that, despite spending hours and hours more time playing and thinking about Dominion, my wife still beats me half the time.  
  
Unfair.

Motto: Infall Klocka

  
Two weeks ago I wrote about [how excited I was for September](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/08/197-september-and-less-projects.html). We are not quite halfway through the month, and it's already been one of my favorite on record. There have been so many landmarks, milestones, good things, and good days. As of noon yesterday, I've been an early adopter of the Moto 360 smartwatch. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's this:   

[![](assets/203-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rVna-ZXggCg/VBTtLabWUwI/AAAAAAABdcc/GUUan06FODs/s1600/8027922626984939832)

The Moto 360 runs an Operating System designed by Google called "Android Wear". At its core, Android Wear is meant to be an extension of your phone, not a replacement of it. The user experience is built around quick, lightweight interactions with the device. If you are using Android Wear correctly, you shouldn't be gawking at your own wrist for 20 minutes at a time. That's not something we want. That's not a compelling user experience. That's not what will drive smartwatches to the masses. The watch keeps your interactions with it short and sweet by delivering only a very specific and confined set of functionalities... and delivering them well. The watch is really only built to do 3 things: 1) Show you the current time 2) Provide simple health metrics 3) Show you notifications 3.1) Show you Google Now cards 3.2) Let you perform immediate actions on either of the above You'll notice I kind of cheated on that list. I'm sorry. What is it like to actually use? I've only got about 24 hours of experience with it, I've not used it anywhere but around the house. But even in that context I found it useful. I was on the couch with my wife, my phone was off somewhere charging when I heard a text come in. Normally, this would make me think "what are the odds that whatever that text was would be important enough to leave my comfortable spot, disturbing my-most-likely-asleep wife? That notification gets sent straight to my wrist now. If it's a message I need to respond to, I can just speak that response into my wrist.  
  
Like a secret agent. ----- written the next day -----  
  
Okay, so I've had the watch for 2 days now. The battery life issue I read about so many times hasn't really been a problem. I put it on around 12 hours ago, have yet to take it off, charge it, turn it off, or otherwise help elongate its battery life, and it's sitting at 40% battery. Basically the same story yesterday.  
  
Here was my awesome Moto 360 story of the day:  
  
Melissa and I went to the Renaissance Fair today. We were eating breakfast when I Googled the fair to look up location and ticket details. When we got in the car, I went to pull up the fair again to start navigation - but I realized Google Now was already showing me how far away the fair was. I swiped up to view the card in full, then over once to see the route, then over again to press the "navigate" button. My phone then popped on and began navigating. My watch would show me the next turn, and buzz when it was time.  
  
It was awesome. This thing is awesome.  
IKEA opened less than 2 miles from Melissa and I's place. We were there on opening night, made a loop around the place. It's basically just as cool as I remembered. On the way out I got two hotdogs and a cinnamon bun for a grand total of $2.00\. They were astounding.  
  
Here's a picture from that - I took something close to a billion:

This is the last thing I have to show for today:

I told you September was going to be awesome.

  
Top 5: Observations from the Renaissance Fair

5\. Melissa can be hypnotized, some.  
4\. Renaissance Fairs are display an awful lot of junk and bits.  
3\. Renaissance Fairs are a good place for creepy dudes to blend in  
2\. Despite both of the above, the atmosphere is very fun. There's tons to do and its a great time.  
1\. Sometimes I wish I were still a kid. I remember the Renaissance Fair being so amazing when I was younger. It was fun today, but I was not able to suspend disbelief... at all.

**Motto: No shirt. No shoes. No thanks.**  
  
Columns will go on as long as they have to.  
  
This Column was **supposed** to be a "**fun**" one, cause I feel like the last one I wrote was a bit of a drag to read. WELL GUESS WHAT! It's not going to be. I'm going to open up a vent and blow out all sorts of pressure (insert fart joke here) that's been building in me for the past 7 years about my incurable autoimmune disease.  
  
If you'd like to skip the upcoming dreck and refuse, you can skip ahead to the Top 5 which I do hope you'll find delightful.  
  
I'm going to write about what it's like to have a  
progressive,  
incurable,  
painful,  
disabling,  
autoimmune disease.  
  
I'll be using works like "pain" and "general suckiness". So calibrate yourself. You've been warned. I might insert jokey jokes for the purposes of sanity here and there - but there's really a ton pent up processing I have that I'd like to vomit all over this Column.  
  
Pain.  
  
I told you I'd be using words like that. SO BUCKLE UP.  
---
  
Shortly after I turned 21 my back started hurting.  
Or maybe it was my butt.  
Or maybe my hip.  
  
I wasn't sure. What I _was_ sure about, though, was something was wrong. After a week of limping, where the pain got worse -not better- I saw a doctor. The doctor said:  
You fell.  
You pulled a muscle playing basketball.  
You slipped a disc.  
You ruptured your whatever.  
  
Then my eye turned red. Like... RED. At first they thought it was pink eye. Just some random other condition, unrelated to my back. After pink eye medication didn't fix anything, Mama called the doctor and the doctor said "no more monkeys jumping on the bed... oh and you might have Ankylosing Spondylitis, so maybe you should Google that when you get home."  
  
So I gave it a Googs.  
_Ankylosing Spondylitis:_  
_Constant, prolonged pain and stiffness, usually worse in the mornings and at night._  
Check.  
  
_Pain usually starts centered about the sacroiliac joint (where the hips meet the spine)._  
Check.  
  
_Sometimes associated with eye inflammation causing severe redness and pain._  
Check  
  
_Usually onsets in the teens or early twenties._  
Check.  
  
_Affects men more often than women._  
I'm a man.  
  
Ah crap.  
  
A rheumatologist would later give me the diagnosis of "**undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy**", which is incredibly hard to say and harder to spell than "ankylosing spondylitis". Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy basically means "yeah you might have Ankylosing Spondyljunk, or you might just have any of a host of other things that are in that family... but regardless you have some form of arthritis and you're screwed, dude."  
  
I lived a very painful month in which I couldn't walk without a limp. I couldn't sleep at night because each position hurt in new and terrible ways. I couldn't look at someone without thinking "they are wondering why your eye is red and you've got a limp." And it was capped off with me hearing the sentence "you can still probably live a relatively full and normal life" and "if we don't treat this aggressively, you may lose the eye" from a couple of specialist doctors at the age of 21.  
  
That was eye-opening.  
  
[![](assets/312-1.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4eYPnMozySY/WQFuG04z0ZI/AAAAAAACptE/uBYxX1Y9PVglcliVcwhPCWbGU7mYuwfNQCLcB/s1600/IMG%5F20130323%5F213550.jpg)

  
During all this time, my then-girlfriend stayed right by my side. In the immediate aftermath she didn't go running away. I'll never stop appreciating my wife for that.  
  
I am thankful every day that I responded well to anti-inflammatory medication. In the 7 years since - I HAVE lived a relatively full and normal life. I've been able to go out and do things, get exercise, make my body even stronger than it was before this whole thing started (which isn't really saying much). I've taken better care of myself than I would have otherwise. I even became almost entirely asymptomatic from June to December 2016... but the nature of these kinds of things is that pain comes and goes, and flare ups can happen any time.  
  
The past 4 months I have been dealing with the biggest flare up I've ever had. The pain is the worst it's been since the first onset 7 years ago.  
  
Do you know what it's like for your first thought each morning to be "this is going to suck"?  
I open my eyes every morning and dread moving. The first movement of the day is one of the most painful. Getting out of bed is a process that involves sort of hoisting myself up with an arm while trying to keep my back straight. I slowly ease onto my feet and feel the grating of bones in the joints of my back and hips. I am made of gravel. The only way to make it better is to purposefully invite more pain as I work the joints until they've warmed up. This involves air squats. Various yoga positions. At 5something in the morning next to my bed.  
  
Putting on pants every morning is terrible. The little hunch that is required to reach my hands and feet together while I'm standing makes me wince. I hold my breath. Then putting on shoes is dessert I get to look forward to. I think I'll take seconds.  
  
Getting in my car is making the choice of EITHER taking the pain of contorting my stupendously long body as I support my weight and bend through the whole spine while I carefully sit OR the pain of the jarring impact when I throw my stiff body into the seat to minimize bending.  
  
I constantly feel like my back needs to pop, but it won't. Even in the immediate aftermath of an "overall" back cracking - I feel like that one spot that really needed didn't get there. It's like successfully cracking all of your knuckles except for the one that was bothering you in the first place. It's like the itch you can't scratch. This wasn't a problem six months ago. I have had needed a pop for 6 months, and my wife, the chiropractor, and even my sister-in-law haven't been able to make it happen.  
  
In the meantime, I have had to set out in sports, push through pain and regret it later.  
I have told my wife I can't do things she wants to do because they hurt too much.  
I have had to bail on social activities.  
I have had make accommodations for myself at work. I pushed for a sit-stand desk. I take fake trips to the bathroom or the water cooler just to move some. I find empty conference rooms so I can do stretches. Today I had to leave work early to fight our wonderful medical system.  
Tomorrow I'm going to miss playing beach volleyball with my team, which makes me sad.  
I'm not looking forward to living up to the commitment I made to play golf next Tuesday.  
  
Being in chronic pain is having a constant reminder that your body is limited. You are limited. The time you have here on earth is limited... and that limited time is further limited to that time in which you are physically and mentally capable of doing things. Having a busted up body breaks the spirit.  
  
People don't want to hear about it, so I don't want to tell them. One of the single biggest and most important topics in my life I can't really bring up. If I did bring it up, I would be constantly bringing it up - because the pain is a constant reminder. If people do hear I have back problems, their first assumption is the wrong one. He's tall. Tall people have bad leverage working against them and their backs suffer from it. I hear advice from people who are trying to be nice and help out someone, but they are helping me solve a different problem that I don't have... or maybe just the problem I don't have yet.  
  
I try to sleep in positions that don't push my head forward; because I fear one day that will be the only position I'll have left.  
  
Most of all, I'm just tired. If you start to Google the phrase _"undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy"_, one of the suggested autocomplete is _"fatigue"_. I'm getting my usual 7 1/2 hours of sleep so far in 2017\. I know this because I measure this... but I never feel really "awake". My focus lacks. My brain wanders. My eyes droop. I'm constantly considering the merits of napping. I've taken more naps in the past 4 months than I recorded in the previous 2 years before that. I fantasize about sleep. I make plans to get to bed earlier and earlier. Even now I'm debating whether this Column is worth finishing tonight. It's exhausting to be in pain all the time. You are constantly fighting just to be normal. With the fighting comes fatigue. With fatigue comes lethargy. Lethargy presents symptoms that look an awful lot on the surface like plain old depression. I am Jack's complete lack of inspiration and motivation to do anything.  
  
That feeling is made worse by the complete failure of things I have tired to do to help myself that haven't done any real good. This month my 30 Day Challenge was dedicated to getting \#BACKtoHealth. I read about my back and things I can do to support it. I have gone to two separate doctors and made appointments with a third for their next availability. I have fought a new pharmacy to get a refill on a prescription I haven't ever filled with them. I was supposed to be getting back into exercise as soon as I felt physically capable... but I haven't felt that way. I have felt worse, actually.  
  
I played golf for the first time in 5 or 6 years... and somehow it caused my chest, shoulder, and mid-back to be as painful as the low back. I couldn't catch my breath for days, because breathing deeply was stabbing my chest. Suddenly my routine of hoisting myself from a laying to sitting position meant feeling my ribs flex and shift as they found a new position they liked. Sharp pains under my left shoulder blade jab me when I try to mobilize my low back or my neck. I am constantly holding my entire torso in a tense, flexed position. I feel like the town drunk who's wearing a barrel for clothes. I've gotta keep my shoulders tight to hold the barrel up and I can't bend one bit. A game that 80 year olds play to keep fit wrecked me for over a week. I'm only now starting to feel a bit better.  
  
All in all. I'm still grateful. Bad times make the good times sweeter. I have enjoyed a long stretch of asymptomatic eyes. With regard to the back - I know that there's probably a light at the end of this particular tunnel... but I also know that after I reach that light, I'll find myself in another tunnel before long. The best I can hope for is long stretches of track that are tunnel-free. I have thought "any day now I'll feel good again" for the past 5 months... and know I _will_ feel good again.  
Any day now.  
  
End sob story.  
  
Now for something completely different.

Motto: Healthy Living, No Gimmicks  
  
GoPro makes one heck of a promotional video. Their newest "GoPro HERO4 Session" camera is tiny, but ultimately not compelling given the sacrifices it comes with. I'd say that's a shame, but thankfully I'm glad I don't want one.  
  
I like what I've been able to do with mine. There's no wrong way to use a GoPro:  
  
  
That was Tony, my dad, and I. We were shootsin'. Killing time, mostly, until I a new niece!  
  
This Saturday (August 1st) is my 27th birthday. I've come to accept that I'm old. SO OLD.  
  
I'm still doing 30 Day Challenges. **July** was to "Rewrite the Life Tracker". It was a complete success. I'm writing about August's challenge now because I don't want to muddy up my next update with 30 Day Challenge stuff. My next post will include my 3rd Second-A-Day video - "My 26th Year".  
  
August will be a busy month. Each day I will:  
* Run a mile
* 100 pushups
* 15 pullups
* Drink only water & coffee
* Eat in, eat up
* Bed at 10
* Wake at 6
* ...and my stretch goal: Stretching (for 15 minutes)

Summarizing all these things - August is going to be a "Month of Healthy Living Habits". They say the key to long-term success is to make little changes over time. I'm tired of that so I'm going to use the shotgun approach.

  
I told you this was going to be short. Here's the picture to go out on:  
  
Melissa is back out of town for work again. So this picture is for me.

Motto: What a Marvelous Accomplishment

**Preface:**  

Before I get started I'd like to let you know that I'm writing this in a coffee shop. The following video reflects my current situation:  
  
  
Okay, now that's done. Either strap yourselves in or bail out now. This column is going to be spectacularly nerdy and long. I'm writing exclusively about the **Marvel Cinematic Universe** (MCU). Please note that while this is _not_ [the first time I've written about this subject](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/04/82-superheroes.html), today's post will be more specifically focused on the MCU.

  
**A Brief History of the Marvel Cinematic Universe:**

The MCU is a series of movies (and a television show) produced by Marvel and distributed by Paramount that exist in the same shared universe, each telling their own story while contributing to a greater, overarching narrative. Specifically, _this_:  
  
  
[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--T3XQSeilrc/UokcEQxa1_I/AAAAAAABDMQ/4Fsiz8zDCzI/s1600/Column+130+-+Marvel+Movies+in+Order.png "Fun fact: this image represents 15% of total content of my mind over the last 5 1/2 years")](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--T3XQSeilrc/UokcEQxa1%5FI/AAAAAAABDMQ/4Fsiz8zDCzI/s1600/Column+130+-+Marvel+Movies+in+Order.png)

  
Those are all the current and confirmed future MCU movies. I didn't include the television show "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." in that graphic because it doesn't really fit at one discrete point within the timeline (and because it's a TV show).   
  
A quick word of warning: my writing will assume you've already seen everything to date and **will include spoilers** for those who haven't.  
  
**Why is This such a Big Deal?**  
Comic books have a long history of using a shared universe, a continual continuity The people, locations, and plotlines from one story connect to the other stories... it's so obvious, but for some reason nobody has successfully done that on-screen. At least not until 2008, thanks to Marvel and Kevin Feige.  
  
  
[![](assets/130-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fA%5Fs11weavw/UpOLhGEkRRI/AAAAAAABDmM/qqW4rt%5FfYHc/s1600/%23130+-+Kevin+Feigejpg.jpg)

  
I listened to [a great interview with Kevin Feige](http://www.nerdist.com/2013/11/nerdist-podcast-kevin-feige/) (warning: that interview contains strong language) the other day. I was nervous going into it, nervous that he would be weird, antisocial, or otherwise unlikable. I was pleasantly surprised. He was as entertaining as he was knowledgeable.  
  
**Phase 3 Movie Predictions:**  
Here's a different, less sophisticated graphic that reaches out a little further:  
  
  
[![](assets/130-2.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QRV14mYIl-Y/UoushuCTlQI/AAAAAAABDX0/XdFdHqSDFeY/s1600/%23130+-+MCU+History.jpg)

  
This timeline starts May, 2008\. The speculative threshold is in July 2015\. At the time of this post, we are sitting at a spot right between Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. There have been roughly two movies a year, every year (2010 and 2012 are exceptions with one movie each). Phase one consisted of six movies. Phase two will have five. Phase three is years away, but will likely be \~6 movies long. This means we are about halfway through.   
  
In order of decreasing likelihood, here are my predictions for movies we are likely to see in phase 3:  
  
1\. Ant Man - This one is the only officially announced movie in Phase 3\. It will introduce us to Henry Pym. It will likely be the funniest of all MCU; and I have no idea what the story will be.  
2\. A Doctor Strange movie, detailing the origins of the Sorcerer Supreme.  
3\. A Mark Ruffalo Hulk Movie. I have no idea what the story will be. There are tons of Hulk storylines.   
4\. A 3rd Captain America movie, with a strong focus on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s other members as well. This may pull in characters from the TV show, but it also may not.  
5\. A Black Panther movie is also heavily rumored. Who knows.  
6\. And there's the chance of a Thor 3.  
  
I look forward to coming back to these predictions in 2 years to see how I did.  
  
I think it would be a wise move for them to pack in as many movies as possible into phase 3 before the Avengers 3\. There very well _may_ be a phase 4, but I have a feeling that viewership may drop some. Viewers will be completely full-up with the awesomeness that was the Avengers 3\. The story will be _huge_ and it will be hard to follow. More on that later.  
  
**Critical Reception and My Reception:**  
Here is the MCU as rated by Rotten Tomatoes (which is the only review venue I usually care about):  
1\. Iron Man (93%)  
2\. The Avengers (92%)  
3\. Iron Man 3 (79%)  
T-3\. Captain America (79%)  
5\. Thor (77%)  
6\. Iron Man 2 (73%)  
7\. The Incredible Hulk (67%)  
8\. Thor: The Dark World (66%)  
  
Here's how I would order them:  
1\. The Avengers  
2\. Iron Man  
3\. Thor: The Dark World  
4\. Iron Man 3  
5\. Captain America  
6\. Thor  
7\. The Incredible Hulk  
8\. Iron Man 2  
  
Keep in mind, the movie that I liked the least (Iron Man 2), I still very much liked. I don't do percentages, but if I did they would only go down as low as _maybe_ 80%.  
  
I have no idea why Thor 2 was so poorly received... I thought it was great.  
  
**What's the deal with the TV show?**  
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. picks up where the Avengers left off. The show follows agent Coulson and a small team of up-and-coming S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal the fallout of the alien invasion of New York and a world where superheroes exist.   
  
The TV show opened _really_ strong. It was the most-watched premier in something like 5 years, and the actual show was pretty good. If you could look past the cheesiness, it was good. The next 3 or 4 episodes were, to be nice, pretty bad. The characters were one-dimensional. The stories were self-contained - they didn't seem to really further any sort of greater narrative. Viewership dropped.  
  
It's slowly getting better and I sincerely hope it continues to. I really want the TV show to work out. In order to do that, they are going to need to start driving towards a larger plot. They need to develop an enemy that lasts for more than one episode. They need to work on character interaction and fill out their backstory. Most importantly, they need to show that there is a master plan and they aren't just wandering aimlessly with each story.   
  
I have faith. I'll stick with it at _least_ until the end of the season. I'm sure they are going somewhere with this... Maybe.  
  
**Some subtle things I've noticed and come to appreciate:**  
Here is where the spoilers from Thor: The Dark World lay - during my second watch in theaters, I noticed a couple different subtle things that contribute silently to the shared universe.   
  
Firstly, the Dark Elves from Thor have displays that _very_ closely resemble those invented by Tony Stark and used in Iron Man:   
  
  
[![](assets/130-3.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wNNQ9UmLEoE/UpPGYAapcQI/AAAAAAABDms/5R5MQQET7HA/s1600/%23130+-+Tony+UI.jpg)

  
This probably is not lazy writing. This is not a lack of imagination. This is a hint that our technology is approaching the "magic" that exists in the other realms. As Thor said in the original Thor movie, "your ancestors called in magic, but you call it science."   
  
The next thing I noticed - in Thor: The Dark World when the Aether takes over Jane Foster her eyes go completely black for a moment. Later, the aether is shown to have an affect on her mind/behavior. Where else did we see this _exact_ same thing?  
  
  
[![](assets/130-4.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gQgO3RIoF8Q/UpO98gTGu8I/AAAAAAABDmc/KChSbv8CuQk/s1600/%23130+-+Avengers+Screencap.png)

  
That's a still from "The Avengers". When Hawkeye is having his mind entered (and subsequently controlled) by Loki's scepter his eyes briefly go black - just like Jane Foster in the new Thor. Having this exact same effect helps show the audience that these stories are related, the mind-control effects are related, and the Tesseract and Aether are related.   
  
Speaking of the Aether and the Tesseract being related...  

  
**The Infinity Gems and the Avengers 3:**  
Here's what everything boils down to - all of the movies in Phase 1 were buildup to the "Marvel's The Avengers" that happened in 2012\. In the last movie to come out before The Avengers, Captain America introduced the Tesseract. The Tesseract was mistakenly believed to be the Cosmic Cube (a big, important thing in Marvel comics) by nearly every nerdfan in existence. It was hinted at in The Avengers that the Tesseract was _not_ actually the Cosmic Cube, but was something else entirely.   
  
After that point (since the beginning of phase 2) Marvel has been playing the long game. Thor: The Dark World was **not** a setup for "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" - it was setup for the _**third**_ Avengers movie - and it all has to do with the Infinity Stones.  
  
[![](assets/130-5.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f9CXGhxFAN8/UounhoiIT3I/AAAAAAABDVs/6s2YWT2ztUQ/s1600/%23130+-+Infinity%5FGems.jpg)  
  
**If you read nothing else in this column, read this next paragraph.**  
The Avenger's 3 will be the culmination of all of the MCU movies up to that point. It will be modeled after a six-issue comic book series called "The Infinity Gauntlet" in which the Avengers gather to fight Thanos who wants to use the collective power of the Infinity Stones to kill literally everyone and everything.  
  
The Infinity Stones (or, as they were originally called, "the Infinity Gems") are six immensely powerful objects in the Marvel Universe. Without going into their lengthy backstory and Marvel's mythology too much, each infinity stone grants its owner completely control over one aspect of the Marvel multiverse. Anyone who possesses all six infinity stones is granted omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience, and God-like power.   
  
Here's a quick TL;DR breakdown of the Infinity Stones:  
  
The Mind Stone allows the user to read the minds or dreams of other beings.The Power Stone allows the user to access all the energy in existence.  
The Reality Stone allows the user to fulfill wishes.  
The Space Stone allows the user to warp space.   
The Soul Stone allows the user to alter or control every soul in the universe.  
The Time Stone allows for time-travel.  
  
Each of those sentences does not not _fully_ explain the powers and capabilities of each stone, but it should give you a pretty good idea.  
  
As confirmed by Kevin Feige, the Tesseract (from Captain America and the Avengers) is the Space Stone. The Aether is referred to in Thor: TDW as an Infinity Stone - but _which_ Stone it is never is explicitly stated. People are guessing it's the Power Stone due to its color and the nature of what Malekith was going to do with it.  
  
In the Avengers 3, Thanos will collect all six Infinity Stones, inlay them in a gauntlet (glove, basically) and use them to basically mess up everything and everyone.  
  
**Beyond Phase 3:**  
Marvel has decades and decades of stories and hundreds and hundreds of characters to pull from. They are open to continuing beyond Phase 3\. Part of me hopes they do, and another part hopes they don't. They have already made history. The Avengers trilogy will make history over again. Beyond that there will be some major obstacles they'll have to overcome. The actors playing their characters are getting older. They can't play their parts indefinitely. They _do_ have a shelf life. So, do you recast? Do you reboot? Do you write it into the story? Does Tony Stark pass on the Iron Man suit to some successor who is the star of future Iron Man movies?   
  
Also, they will possibly "jump the shark" with this whole Infinity Gauntlet thing. Trying to keep on going after that will be even harder than keeping on after the original "The Avengers". This is why I'm most hopeful they do Avengers 1 through 3 and then call it done.  
  
Then again, I've always been the kind of person who'd rather want something he doesn't have than have something he doesn't want.  
  
**Editorial Note on My Previous Writings:**  
I re-read Column #82, the original Feature Column on superheroes I wrote way back in April several times while I wrote this one. I wanted to share a few notes/corrections from that post.  
  
1\. I wrote a _ton_. I did that again with this post, but hopefully dividing it into sections and add colorful pictures made it a bit easier?  
2\. The picture that I posted in that column is no longer displaying. That's because I didn't re-host it on this blog, I just pulled it directly from the source. Because it's gone now, I've taken steps to prevent this from happening again in future posts. I did this a _lot_ in the past now that I'm looking back... it's a shame.  
  
**Postface:**  
I don't do features very often because they tend to take several days to write. In the case of this feature, it took me 8 days to write. I started it way back when it would have been a normal, timely update, but I couldn't finish it. To make matters worse, I once lost about 1/2 of the post on a bad save 3/4ths the way through the project.  
  
  
Top 5: Things I'm Hoping for in the Second Half of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

5\. That all the actors, writers, producers, and directors live long enough to finish out the rest of the project.  
4\. That nobody else pulls a Norton and forces themselves out of the project.  
3\. The introduction of new characters doesn't dilute the presence of those we already have and love. New characters _can_ and _should_ be introduced - but they need to be done in the right way. I don't claim to know how that's done; but I do know it's possible.  
2\. That the TV show "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." ends by finishing the story they want to tell, instead of by cancellation. Keeping this in mind, I hope that it has _no more_ than 3 seasons. The first 6 episodes haven't been overly compelling.  
1\. They _stop_ _making movies_ before the run out of stories that make sense together, characters that fit well, actors, or inspiration. As soon as any _one_ of those go, the others will surely follow.

Motto: Give it a Break Already

  
My Feature on constrained writing was the last post of a very busy month for the Column. To me it felt kind of like I went out with a bang. It was difficult to write, but full of fanciness. It was the feather in the cap of my "write every day in March" challenge. I write a lot, so March's challenge wasn't too challenging. I did that on purpose, though. I started my new job this month and have since been under an usual amount of stress. Add to that the wedding planning and it's pretty obvious I needed a light month (albeit most of the heavy planning is being done by Melissa - my efforts go toward supporting her efforts). Writing every day was easy enough. I'd write about how it was, the process, and my thoughts and feelings on the challenge - but I've written enough over the past 30 days. I'll just say that it didn't feel difficult. I wrote every day but one or two when I was preoccupied. I posted 16 Columns. That's slightly over one every other day. It only felt excessive insofaras I gave you guys too much to read. That's the only takeaway I got from this month. I guess you only get out of a project what you put into it. My next challenge will be more difficult. Before I wrap this up, there's two other things I want to say: I had a half day over this past weekend to do with what I pleased. I decided to use it to migrate the Life Tracker from the old Google Spreadsheets over to the new Spreadsheets. I figured it would be a huge todo, but I was able to create a template version of the Tracker, import all my old data, make a couple of aethetic changes, and use a newly introduced function to replace the old, slow custom-built function I made. The whole thing took less than 3 hours; and I expected it to be days worth of work. Now the Life Trackers is faster, more reliable, and just a bit prettier. I'm proud of it. I just watched Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I have so many things to say, but don't want to spoilerize everyone this early. I'll just say this: It was phenomenal and I loved it.

**30 Day Challenge Breakdown:**January: Paleo Diet -> Lost \~5-10 lbs & learned a ton February: 5 Books -> 3 books March: 30 days of writing -> 28 days of writing, 16 Columns April: ... My usual workout consists of a half mile warmup, 30-45 minutes of lifting, sometimes a bit of HIIT if I'm feeling zealous, then a cooldown. If I were to do only cardio, my workout would be to run MAYBE 2 miles. That's not good enough. SO...

**I, Aaron Gillespie, will run 50 miles in April.** 

...and I'm off to start running!

Top 5: Pros/Cons about Writing Every Day

5\. Con: You are on your own little world more often. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, I'm already in my own little world enough as it is. It's a bad thing.  
4\. Pro: It keeps your mind sharp and forces you to process things.  
3\. Con: It takes time that you could spend lifting weights and cooking food.  
2\. Pro: Forcing yourself to write when you don't necessarily have something interesting in mind going in can make you lead you to some interesting places you wouldn't have otherwise gone.  
1\. Con: Sometimes you don't make it to those interesting places and you are boring.

Motto: Simply Perfect

  
I am writing whole piece this using only the ten hundred most often used words. I am doing this because [a guy whose work I enjoy](http://xkcd.com/about/) did this, which you can see by [pressing these words](http://xkcd.com/1133/). I am using [this thing](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/09/22/a-thing-explainer-word-checker/) [he made](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/09/22/a-thing-explainer-word-checker/) to check my work.  
  
This week is a big week for me. A company I really like put out [their newest phones](https://store.google.com/). A different company I really like is BOTH coming out with more of [their television show](http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield) AND [their movie](http://movies.disney.com/marvels-avengers-age-of-ultron) to buy that you could not get until now. An [short movie maker](https://www.youtube.com/user/screenjunkies) made a short movie about the movie I am excited to buy. [Touch here to see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeDJAKvcZ9o). Last, [a different movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/) is coming out that my wife and I both want to watch. We read [the book from which this movie came](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FMartian%5F%28Weir%5Fnovel%29) last month. It was very good so we expect the movie to also be very good. I am excited for these things, and other things coming soon.  
  
I ordered the larger phone. It comes in six weeks. It has many things I am excited for:   
* The camera that has larger light gathering spots so more light comes in for your photos.
* A camera that is faster than before and it takes bigger photos (because it has more light spots).
* The phone should live for longer between powering times.
* The larger screen that can light up some parts while not lighting up other parts if it wants to.
* The new running system that does new and cool things.
* Much like my wife's phone:
   * The outside of it is made of metal and not plastic.
   * It looks at your finger to know who you are.
   * The flash has two colors to make pictures look better.
   * It's bigger than my old one.
   * It can make slow movies.
   * It can make big movies.
   * It has more space to save stuff.
* There are two speakers, and they are on the front of the phone.
* There is a new power line that works both ways and works faster.
* It looks like this:

That black bar on the back is strange, but I will get used to it. I am already used to it. I now like the black bar.  
  
Writing like this is actually really fun. I wouldn't want to do it all the time, but it really makes you think about what you are saying. I have a problem where sometimes I say things or ask questions that don't really get the information that I want to get. If I want to know whether or not I should take a plate from the table for someone I ask "do you want more food?", when instead I should ask "do you want me to take that plate?".   
  
Just now, I used a thing I learned a short time ago to figure out what words I can say by looking in a special way at this page. I can see all the words at once. Most people wouldn't know how to do what I just did. That made me feel cool for a second.  
  
I very much enjoyed writing this.

Motto: Some Handsome Hand  
  
I don't like this post. You should skip it. I'm not saying this to intrigue you into reading further. This Column was supposed to be _about_ something. Then it turned into me writing about me writing, which I'm exacerbating by talking about it right now.   
  
SKIP IT.  
SKIP IT.  
BOP IT.  
TWIST IT.  
SKIP IT.  
SKIP IT.  
SNAKE PIT.  
SKIP IT.  
SKIP IT.  
  
I really liked my previous post. It's in my top 5\. It actually is.  
  
Thanks to the way I started this Column, I just read through dozens of my old posts. Sometimes I make myself laugh. Other times I make myself cringe. I wonder if and when I'll stop writing like I know better than people. Maybe that's the nature of writing your current opinions on the things you're currently thinking about.  
  
I didn't continue writing after that. Here I am a few days later, I went back even further into the archive Column. All the way back to #150\. It's a little disheartening seeing stuff I wrote about 3 years ago that I have since forgotten about. Goals that died. Well-stated opinions or personal mottos that I've since forgotten about. Well summarized topics that I later revisited, demonstrating what seems like a regression in aptitude or attitude. Literal instances of things I've already done that I have very recently thought, "it would be a fun thought experiment to do (this thing)". I found a Top 15 Life Pro Tips... I've been writing a "Life Pro Tips" Google Keep note so I could write a Column about it.  
  
Bro you already did that.  
Bro you should move on.  
Bro, don't call yourself bro.  
  
It's not all bad, though. I have written some things that weren't total crap. This is total crap. OH GOD THIS IS TOTAL CRAP.  
  
HI!  
  
Blade Runner: 2049 was a thoroughly entertaining movie. It continued entertaining me hours after I left the theater. Makes you think. Thinking is a good thing.  
  
My 30 Day Challenge for last month was supposed to be "monotasking", but really it turned into nothing. This month the Challenge is "no passive entertainment", but really it's turned into "monotasking". God I write about 30 Day Challenges too much. I write about goals and projects too much. I have two whole posts that are basically just "here are the projects I'd like to do someday". They're basically copies of one another. Worse yet, every second post includes some form of "HEY HERE'S A THING I'VE DECIDED I AM DOING. LOOK AT ME!"  
  
My corporate social sports sand volleyball team got first place in our division. So that's cool. There was a Star Wars trailer that looked good?  
  
Good God. Next one will be better I hope.

Motto: You Don't Exercise because You Have Energy, You Exercise because it GIVES You Energy

  
Today's post is about two mostly unrelated things: Social Networking and Fitness. Social Networking: To me, social networking for the longest time meant "Facebook". Since that time a whole crop of things deeming themselves "social networks" have come and gone; and I tried out many of them. Twitter. Path. Tumblr. Google Buzz. Foursquare. LinkedIn. Instagram. Pinterest. Vine. Diaspora. Google+. They have all had their highlights, and their low points. The one thing they all have in common is that they aimed to become a place where you could go and see "what's happening" with your friends. You could hear their opinion on some current event(Twitter), see a picture of their coffee (Instagram), and see what projects they claim to be working on (Pinterest). Enter Google Hangouts. Hangouts is not posed to its users as a "social network". It's the chat service that was born alongside (or as a part of) Google+. Hangouts, for the most part, exists in its own silo. This chat service has become my "social network". It is where I go to see what my friends are doing. I've been in a group hangout with the majority of the groomsmen from my wedding for well over a year now. As a result, we talk all the time. Similarly I have a group hangout with my in-laws and one for the group of friends who live close by. With Hangouts, communication is convenient, picture sharing is easy, and the platform doesn't gum up the works with tons of useless features. It's basically everything I've ever wanted out of a "social network". You don't go there to mindlessly wander around, hoping to find something interesting your friends did or said. Content on Hangouts is 100% relevant to you. Facebook is still terrible, by the way. Fitness: I was originally going to make this a feature post about fitness, but such a post would really REALLY require a lot of work. Also, I'm still not nearly qualified to write anything approaching "authoritative" about the subject. Everything I'm above to say is my opinion based off things I've read/experienced over the past five or so years. I spout broscience at best. With that disclaimer disclaimed, I now begin. "Exercise is a required part of a full & happy life." If I had to give general life advice to someone, that would be one of the first bullet points I hit. Shortly thereafter I'd probably work in the motto from this post. Fitness is a very broad concept. I think fitness can be broken down into 5 mutually orthogonal dimensions: 1\. Strength 2\. Endurance 3\. Coordination 4\. Flexibility 5\. Power To be truly "fit", one should aim to seek to maximize each of those 5 facets of fitness. Specializing in any one or two of those areas is fine, but doing so at the expense of neglecting others is not. At any given gym, I'd say the "healthiest" person in the room is not the strongest, or the most flexible, or the person that's been on the treadmill for 2 hours... but instead the guy who's half as good as each of those people in their respective specialties. Not as strong as the strongest, but more flexible with better endurance. Not as flexible as the yogii, but able to move heavy objects and traverse long distances quickly. You get the picture. Speaking of pictures, I've been developing a greater appreciation of data visualization techniques. Here's what I'll call the "Fitness Pie":   

[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9oGNhW8x3EM/VScYqLkx1OI/AAAAAAABrM4/AjN2MQbrRz4/s1600/%23237%2B-%2BFitness%2BPie.PNG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9oGNhW8x3EM/VScYqLkx1OI/AAAAAAABrM4/AjN2MQbrRz4/s1600/%23237%2B-%2BFitness%2BPie.PNG)

Sidenote - That's not a pie chart. Pie charts are useful when you're showing several data points that sum to 100%. These data points are independent of one another. It's essentially a radial bar chart. I don't know if this type of chart has a standard name. - End sidenote If I were to rank myself on the 5 dimensions of fitness, I'd probably go Coordination > Flexibility > Power > Strength > Endurance. I'm fairly coordinated & flexible (minus my hips). I'm more "powerful" than outright "strong". The difference here is that strength = force and power = the ability to apply force quickly. Being able to throw a baseball far is not a matter of strength so much as it is a matter of power. Lastly I follow up with endurance, which for me peaks out around "jog a mile and a half". For me, endurance is the least enjoyable dimension to improve (and it doesn't help that running bothers my back). What does your Fitness Pie look like? The last thing I want to talk about is the answer to the question "why exercise?" The standard answer to this question talks about how consistent exercise reduces your risk of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, and so on and so forth. Then usually they'll toss in the benefits regular exercise gives to your mental health, athletic performance, and usually add in a tidbit about attractiveness. Those things are all true, but they don't really answer the question for me on a day-to-day basis. Why exercise? I work all day by sitting in a padded chair, moving a mouse, and typing on a keyboard. When I get home, many of my hobbies involve sitting in a padded chair, moving a mouse, and typing on a keyboard (as a matter of fact, I'm doing that right now). While I'll be the first person to tell you just how awesome those things are - there's an itch that they just don't scratch. Something visceral. Something primal. Something you can't quite put your finger on. You may not even know it's there until it's gone. Like the humming of the refrigerator or the air conditioner, you don't really notice it - but when it's gone you realize instantly what you were missing. I scratch that itch by deadlifting.

In late 2013 I watched a TED Talk that changed my life. Attributing a life change to a TED Talk feels somewhat embarrassing in 2019, but it happened to me. The video (in the header of this post) is Matt Cutts' talk on incorporating 30 Day Challenges into your life. It's short and provides context for everything I'm about to talk about - so I recommend watching it before proceeding.

## Quick List of All Challenges I've Done

0. Paleo + Crossfit
0. The Swollening

That list is in descending chronological order. "The Swollening" *(which was called "[The October Project](https://aarongilly.com/120)" at the time)* took place in October 2013, about 6 months after the TED Talk was published. If you were obsessive or weird mathematical savant, you might have already figured out that there have been 72 months between then and now, and my list up there only goes to 46. That means that 25 of those months I did not run a 30 Day Challenge. Of those 24 months, 2 times I just failed so miserably at achieving my goal that I didn't even feel it was worth writing down (e.g. "eat a Paleo diet" but then I ate pizza for dinner on day 1), the other 22 months came in chunks, where my system of 30 Day Challenges was put on hold to do some other, related thing. I held the "No Zero" challenge for 10 months straight, before accepting it as a Standard Operating Procedure & moving on with new Challenges. For all of 2016 I did [a complicated, multi-faceted New Year's Resolution](https://aarongilly.com/277), rather than 12 individual 30 Day Challenges. As I'll get to later, I don't recommend that sort of all-at-once approach. My point here is just that I've been doing this stuff for a while. 

I have thought of myself as an amateur writer, amateur self-tracker, and amateur in the world of N=1 experiments, but that's changed. By no means am I a professional *any* of those things... but I have given myself permission to feel qualified to talk about them with interested parties. I'll have to keep that little self-realization in mind if I ever meet an interested party. Anyway, back to it.

## Challenge Selection Analysis

Most of my 46 challenges lump into a few main categories:

* Exercise - e.g. Run 50 Miles, Try CrossFit
* Diet - e.g. Don't Eat Out, Paleo, Whole30, The Incredible Bulk, Blue Apron
* Productivity - e.g. Bullet Journal, Active Time Tracking, Write Every Day, Study Every Day, Digital Minimalism, and others

That list isn't exhaustive.

Some of my favorite challenges don't fall into any of those categories. For example: "Yes Man" in which I said *yes* to every opportunity presented to me for a month. Or the "Only new places" challenge, in which I did not go to any restaurant, gas station, grocery store, or other business - unless it was my first time in that place.

## Challenges I Found to be the Most Worthwhile

### Blue Apron

The Blue Apron Challenge was great not because it's the best food service in the world and we continue to use it to this day. It's not and we don't. It was great because it was an awesome learning experience. We learned that we had the capacity to cook fancy things using our own kitchen. We learned new cooking techniques. We learned how to incorporate vegetables into meals and that doing so was actually a good addition.

### Before Work Workout

This challenge was so nice I did it twice. It takes discipline to follow through on, but when you start the day with the discipline to get out of bed and into the gym, everything else that day is just a bit easier. Also, it feels incredible to have accomplished something worthwhile by 7:30AM. Plus it's the best way to ensure you actually work out 5 days a week. If you wait until after work to sneak in a workout, exercise will get preempted by life.

### Yes Man

This challenge came about after re-reading the *book* Yes Man by Danny Wallace. For a month I took away my ability to choose whether or not I **wanted** to do something - I just did it. Relieving myself of the ability to choose not to do something weirdly made me much more content to do things like "hey can you do the dishes?" It wasn't "*sigh*, yes." I just started doing them. It made me truly realize that what you're doing is less important than your attitude about what you're doing. They key to this challenge, though, is not to let people know you're doing it.

### Paleo & CrossFit

This wasn't the first challenge, but it was the first one that I decided to go all-in on. We joined a CrossFit gym for a month, and ate a (modified) Paleo diet. I learned a LOT during this month. For one thing, I realized how effective CrossFit is at wearing me out. Also that I felt better when I ate less garbage. These habits didn't truly stick, though.

### Whole30

I hestitate to mention this, because it's so similar to the above - but Whole30 really introduced a long-term change in our diet. If you don't know what Whole30 is, just think of it as a (quite strict) more-strict-than-paleo-but-paleo-like diet. I lost 15 pounds in a month, and haven't really gained any of that weight back. We don't keep bread in the house any more. We don't keep cereals. We don't keep chips or other snacks.

### Digital Minimalism

This is my most recent challenge - and came with some habit changes that I think are likely to stick. I **really enjoyed** this challenge. 

I turned my phone to Do Not Disturb for the whole month. It rang if someone in my *contacts* called me, and alarms worked as normal - but other than that it was **silent**. No notifications for texts. None for "Scam Likely" callers. I've subsequently just turned off notifications for every app that isn't my phone or my Ring Video Doorbell. Also - I uninstalled Reddit, and only went there twice during the month. Once because I wanted to hear what Reddit was saying about Marvel losing Spider-man, and once because I was bored and too tired to be productive. The great thing is, I didn't miss it. Rather than defaulting to low-quality information binges, I just spent that time working on personal projects. I got much more done... and that's a much more rewarding and satisfying use of time than browsing /r/all.

Then, while working these personal projects, I would get *way more done* due to the lack of distraction. There's a reason this website looks different today than it did 30 days ago. 

This is what intentionality feels like. It feels good.

## Challenges at which I Failed Miserably and Unexpectedly

### No Screens After 10pm

Turns out I'm addicted to screens. I didn't really figure out in advance what I was going to do *instead*. Then I found myself just sitting around. Then I thought of stuff I could be working on, but required my phone or computer. On day 2 or 3 I said screw it.

### "Healthy Life"

This challenge was never defined. I was the quintessential loser who wanted to "turn it all around for the New Years!" but had zero follow-through on deciding what that meant. I wanted to swallow the world with this one, and wound up doing nothing at all.

### Run 50 Miles

Turns out running extended periods caused my lower back to flare up. After day 3, I was in near constant back pain. I thought doing the "barefoot"-style running (running on your toes) would help prevent that. It didn't. That's what I learned from that.

## 30 Day Challenge Design Tips

If you're interested in trying something like this for yourself, and I highly recommend it to everyone, here are some pro-tips.

* Don't be overly ambitious. This means you should aim to change **one** thing - and only change it to an extent that its reasonable to accomplish without sacrificing other things in your life.
* Don't be vague. What specific behavior are you going to do. When are you going to do it. How are you going to do it. How will you know when you've done it.
* If your goal is to remove a habit, try replacing it with something instead. This isn't specific to 30 Day Challenges, but given that so many 30 Day Challenges involve habit change, it's something to keep in mind.
* Do stuff you're interested in. If you're thinking about doing something, don't Google "Good 30 Day Challenge Ideas". I'm guilty of having done that when I felt uninspired, and guess what - I failed every time. If you're truly out of ideas, see the Top 5 below.

## Closing Thoughts

30 Day Challenges are a habit I'm really glad I've adopted. They're a great way to learn about yourself, the world, and life in general. They mark the passage of time. They make you grow as a person. If you're doing them, though, maybe don't talk about it all the time. I took to just writing to strangers on the internet about them rather than boring my friends about them.

# Top 5: Recommended Starting Challenges

0. Start the day by drinking a full glass of ice water. Notice how much it wakes you up. Notice how forcing yourself to prepare enough the night before to have the glass by your bed ready for the morning makes for a nice little routine.
0. Say "Yes" to every opportunity that comes up. Notice how what you do changes. Notice how how you *feel* about what you do changes.
0. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb. Notice how much easier it is to ignore it. Notice how many more periods of uninterrupted quality time you get thinking, working, or with friends or family
0. Track your time, or food, or money, whichever thing you think you could be managing better. You don't have to change anything about it. Just write down what you're doing with it. Analyze when you're finished. That which gets measured, gets managed.
0. Just do whatever you're passionate about. If you want it, you're much more likely to stick with it.

Motto: It's All Good (Except for the Bad Stuff)

  
When I was in middle school I was in a band. I played the bass guitar with 3 of my great friends. I don't actually remember the name of the group, but I do remember that I was going to suggest the name of our first album be "It's All Good" subtitled, "Except for the Bad Stuff". That was Middle School Aaron's humor. It's idiotic and surface-level and 25 year old Aaron still thinks it's pretty funny. I guess you only mature in the areas you have to. I have always had a unique brand of humor. I'm not saying that like it's a good thing or something I'm praticularly proud of - it's just fact. The things I think are funny don't always align with the humor of the population at large. Or, if it is something other people "get", it may hit me harder... or not at all. I take jokes and run them into the ground. I push them past the line that separates "funny" from "too far". I make Melissa pretty mad. Why? Why go there? Why go from a state where everybody else is laughing to a state where nobody else is laughing? I think it's because that's when I laugh the hardest; and I'm just that selfish. I apologize for my selfishness, but I will never apologize for dad humor. I will never stop making the obvious joke. I will never stop pushing the joke ad obsurdium. I will never stop laughing at my own jokes. And lastly, I will never stop saying "Hi Tired! Nice to meet you! Gee you sure look a lot like my fiance, Melissa! Say, what kind of a name is 'Tired', anyway?". Here's the picture to go out on:

Top 5: Jokes I Heard in High School that Only I Laughed At 

5\. "Whenever you get down, you drink a Coke. Then you think 'wow, I still feel terrible, but I got a good taste in my mouth.'" 4\. "I don't do English homework. That's why they call it 'English'." 3\. "I know that stomach feeling - I'm going to have to take a dump later." 2\. "Let's go look at donuts." 1\. "Fine. I'll drive... but if I crash and kill everyone I don't wnat to hear any complaining about 'Ooo, you killed me'."

Doesn't it seem like 2020 has always been *"the future!"*. Technically as of this writing that's still true... but almost assuredly for you reading this it is **not** true. What's the future like, guys? Are you flying around in your jetpacks? Has the singularity happened yet I can't wait for *the world of tomorrow!*

I wanted to write a huge, sprawling review of the past decade & a fully-imagined picture of the next decade; but this isn’t that. This post is not primarily about the past. It's about the future. But to give context to that future, let's briefly look at the past.

# **Last Decade**

## **2010 - 2014**

![[384-1.jpg]]

Since the ball dropped on December 31st 2009...

- Melissa and I were dating & working on-campus at KU.
- I started to get interested in personal development and did a time-tracking project.
- My back started hurting in earnest and I learned I'm not invincible.
- I started doing my "Demetri List" - named after Demetri Martin, whose [standup I stole the concept from](https://youtu.be/NzsEtafv-FA?list=PLB47E5A265F29A6CA&t=374)
- I started writing again (in this blog).
- Melissa and I graduated with our respective degrees.
- I got my first big boy job.
- I lived by myself for a year.
- I panicked about wasting a lot of time with nothing to show for it, and started what would eventually become "The Life Tracker".
- We got engaged.
- We got married.
- We moved in together. Got a couple of cats. Upgraded apartments a few times.

## **2015 - 2019**

![[384-2.jpg]]

The second half of the decade saw both changes and stability...

- I did some continuing-education courses for fun online and learned more coding.
- I rewrote the Life Tracker from scratch, a code base which I've lived on for nearly 5 years now.
- I upgraded my career situation.
- We bought a house and learned what it means to be homeowners.
- We got pregnant and had an awesome baby, who's quickly grown into an awesome toddler.
- We started taking health more seriously.
- We learned to cook.
- We built and started actually using a pretty great home gym.
- I started taking my continuing-education and personal development hobbies more seriously

Continuing my education and working on personal development stuff is the area of my life where I see the greatest potential to hit this target:

![[384-3.png]]

A professor once told our class that hitting that target, finding something at the intersection of those three things, was key to having a satisfying and enjoyable life. I wrote that down. I still think it's a pretty great piece of advice. Once you think you're there you can't rest on your laurels... nor should you want to. It is for that reason that I have more content below this line.

## **Long-term Planning**

About 2 years ago was when my *original* post-college-5-year-plan was supposed to end. I am happy to say everything played out *pretty* according to plan. I don't have a graduate degree, and it took me roughly 6 years to get to the spot I wanted to be in 5 years... but aside from those two quibbles - I'm where I want to be. Now where am I *going*? Where do I want to be? More importantly, *who* do I want to be?

Those are my questions now.

## **Goal Mapping**

When thinking long-term, it's best to think first about *who* you want to be, not *what* you will have accomplished. Go from who you want to be to *what* does that person do? What do they have? What have they done to get to where they are? Then work your way backwards to medium-term goals. What will you need to do by when? You can then work your way further back to the short term goals, habits, and systems that are necessary to accomplish those medium-term goals. This maps your short-term behaviors to the long-term reasons why. It ensures you're spending your time and energy in ways that move you toward who you want to be.

I don't want to share my *entire* future outlook in this Column; but I do feel comfortable sharing an example from it:

In 5 years I want to be a music-capable individual. I'd like to be able to create new music utilizing some level of competence on an instrument. This means that in a year's time I should probably have a good idea of *what* instrument I want to play. I should have ownership over that instrument. Musicians consistently practice their instruments. If I want to be a musician, I need to practice consistently.  

# **2020 - 2030**

![[384-4.jpg]]

Given that we're at the transition period between decades, it feels appropriate to think even *more* long-term than the standard "five year plan". I've spent a decent amount of time thinking about the next decade. What do I want life to look like in 2030? How old will my family be? What milestones will happen between now and then? What do I need to start thinking about now? 

The plan is not to set the next 10 years in stone. The plan is to think about them. Make a rough timeline, based off where I want to be in 2030, what my relationships look like, and what I will have accomplished by then... then adjust the plan as I go along. 

Because that plan is subject to change, I don't feel comfortable posting it to the general internet... but I cannot recommend this practice highly enough.

## **A System of Self-Actualization**

I recently had one of those awesome total-brain moments of clarity. It was a purely theoretical (and beautiful) amalgamation of all the "me" things I've been doing for the past several years into one **massive** idea. I pictured of a system of processes, tools, and hobbies that come together to form a cohesive whole. Combining getting things done with habit change, with principle-based goal-setting, with quantified self concepts, with app development and writing. Put simply, I visualized a systematized method of self-actualization. Structured, yet flexible. Robust, yet only as intensive as you want. It's very much in the center of that Venn Diagram from above.

Honestly it's too big to talk about here. For a sneak preview of the framework, read this entire post. I'm pretty jazzed about the idea. I hope much about it will follow on this blog.

Before we go, though...

# **2019 in Data**

In 2019 I...

- Finished 69 movies (17 in theaters), 28 books (and gave up on 6), and 2 videogames.
- Watched at least one television show on at least 90 days.
- Logged 129 workouts - which is up 30% over last year, but still below the target of 3/week (156/year).
- Tracked calories less frequently than any previous year, at 165 days fully tracked (compared to 213 days tracked on average from other years) Those days that I *did* log showed a marked decrease in calorie consumption, at 2475 (compared to 2785 calories/day on average from other years). My carb ratio is down, bringing the other two macros up. In turn with all the above, my weight has dropped by ~8 pounds after being steady for the past 6 years.
- Wrote 26 Columns, including this one. One every 2 weeks.
- Saw family 55 times and friends 127 times.

# **Top 5: Goals for 2020**

1. Complete 24 Gillespedia articles
2. Have ZERO 3 day streaks without exercise
3. To learn to play ~10 things on a guitar
4. Transition the Google Spreadsheets based "Life Tracker" into the (likely AWS-based) Data Journal component of my new, as of yet unnamed system
5. Some family fun goals we're finalizing

# Motto: Putting the "Multi" in "Multimedia"

This column is an exploration of all the different forms of multimedia I can create; it's also an experiment to do so in such a way that I tell all the stories I wanted to tell in this post. Everything in this post is completely original content created by yours truly (if you couldn't already tell by the terrible production value).

First off, I want to start with the podcast I made for this column:

## [Podcast w/ homemade motiff]
<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104202631" width="100%"></iframe>

I got Randall Munroe's book "XKCD Volume 0" for my birthday. It looks like this: 

## [Drawing (MS paint)]
![])(http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KSuLxyDMrYQ/Uf7mQIZAsqI/AAAAAAAA588/aCPktdLzzhc/s320/Column+104+-+Paint+Drawing.png)

## [Text (computer)]
In [this book](http://store.xkcd.com/collections/everything/products/xkcd-volume-0), there is a selection of the first 600 comics. Rather unexpectedly (for those people that don't read the description of the book, namely, people like me) there are doodles, notes, and puzzles in the margins. 

Randall Munroe is clever, smart, and, worst of all, educated. With these puzzles, I feel as though I have been issued a challenge. You could say, the book blasted me in the face with a surprise challenge (as illustrated below).

## [Animation (Photoshop)]
![](assets/104-1.gif)

In the margins are mostly codes. Cryptic strings of text that don't have any context or explanation. Actual example:

`10TAE/KE`
`201BSWIY`
`0DE6STN8`
`CO25.RAP`

What does THAT mean? I haven't figured it out yet.

Here are my ground rules:
1. I can't simply Google "What's the answer to _____"
2. Other than that, I can use any method I know or feel like.

The first code/puzzle I figured out was easy, but still very rewarding. I learned Braille (at least temporarily learned it). Here's what I ended up with after all was said and done:

## [Text (hand)]
![](assets/104-2.jpg)

I stumbled across the NP-Complete problem from [XKCD 287](http://xkcd.com/287/). The problem is well-stated in the comic, but essentially asks to find a combination of menu items that add up to a unique total cost:

Menu items are $2.15, $2.75, $3.35, $3.55, $4.20, and $5.80. The combined total is $15.05.

Figure out it.

Go.

I took a night to think about it. Then over a lunch break I wrote the following code (most of you can just skip this):

## [Text (code)]
~[](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MCX2a_ZeJr8/Uf_wyMsmEhI/AAAAAAAA6AM/gRjAp_x8Dms/s640/Column+104+-+Menu+Code.PNG)

I found the solution and made a general framework for finding solutions of any similar [Knapsack Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). I wrote the code over lunch. This is what I looked like over lunch:

## [Animation (Hand)]
![](assets/104-3.gif)

By the way, $2.15x7 is $15.05. There's another solution, but you can figure that out for yourself.

Coding/algorithm practice is more than just a good mental exercise, it's fun. That's what makes me excited for this - here's me being excited about the book:

## [Drawing (tracing really)]
![](assets/104-4.jpg)

It even inspired me to write this:

## [Poetry]
Some people look at cars,
other folks watch TV.
Some listen to rock stars,
I read XKCD.

I do read XKCD. Every week, three times a week. Since I got the book, I read it even more. In fact, here's a pretty good way to summarize my day:

## [Video w/ homemade music]

{% include video id="0RRfYNixPWA" provider="youtube" %}

Yup.

Here's a picture I took an then over-edited like a 11 year old who just found photoshop on his parent's computer:

## [Photography and gross misuse of photoshop]
![](assets/104-5.jpg)

At some point, I may figure out what all of the codes mean. I've pictured that moment, and it looks like this:

## [Drawing (cartoon really)]

Soon.

Motto: WELCOME TO MY NATION OF ARTICULATION  
  
I'm an adult, dude.  
  
I'm sitting at the table in my kitchen, the one that used to be my only table. I own a table. I own a _kitchen_. My number of refrigerators went from zero to two in a single day. I own a lawn mower. I paid money to buy a thing whose soul purpose is to perform a task I used to despise doing (and, in all likelihood, will continue to despise). I have a second table right over there. There's four chairs at it, that I also own. I bought all these things because I need to use them from time to time.   
  
More than just possessions, though - I'm an adult because I have opinions about insurance companies & taxes. I have a wife an a retirement account. I'm closer to 30 than 20, closer to 50 than 5\. I'm an adult because "he's too young to have known any better" is not a viable excuse for anything anymore. "I value my time" has replaced "I don't wanna" as an excuse for not doing boring things. I worry about people and things that aren't myself and my things. I'm an adult because I the prospect of having a kid no longer sounds like "the worst thing that could happen".   
  
I'm an adult because I know how to solve problems & I'm confident in my ability to do so. I recognize limitations and don't think I shouldn't need help. I'm an adult because I can use double-negatives without fear of losing points on the assignment. I care more about what I think of me than what random people on the street think of me. I listen to talk radio more than the Top 40\. Young people reference things I don't know about. I'm an adult because I have legitimate right to complain about "well we didn't have **laptops** in school back when I was your age!". I have a 40 hour/week job that I don't mind working at for 55 if it gets the job done. I like HGTV. Going to Home Depot and Lowes doesn't bore me out of my mind anymore. I think about school districts. I feel feelings that other people are feeling, even though the thing that happened to them didn't happen to me - so why should I feel anything at all? That never used to happen.  
  
I'm an adult because I can disagree with someone wholeheartedly, but still respect their opinions and choices. I love spreadsheets. I made a modification to the desk that I own using tools I bought and it all went pretty well. I don't have a bedtime, but I give myself one anyways... which is why I've got to wrap this up.  
  
This is me:

Top 5: Counter Arguments to this Whole Post  
5\. I just made a reference to The Lonely Island.  
4\. I really want the next Nintendo when it comes out.  
3\. I just wrote probably near 100 sentences that all start with "I", or have an "I" implied at their beginnings.  
2\. I squeal like a toddler when the Marvel logo shows up at the beginning of a movie. Well, a movie of a certain canon.  
1\. I ate this post while wearing jammies & eating Kraft Mac & Cheese for dinner. Not as a side, Kraft Mac & Cheese was the entire dinner.

# Motto: The times, they are (not) a changin'

It's already a half hour past when I told myself I'd be going to sleep. I am not tired. That could be because I've been running ragged all day and I'm having a hard time turning my brain of hyperdrive, or it could be because I didn't eat proper dinner until 10pm. It's probably both.

I worked out this morning. Looked at myself in the mirror after I got done. I almost saw a muscle, I swear.

I have taken the past half hour to go through my last 20ish posts and give them proper labels. Labels function like tags. If I think a column is particularly picture-heavy, I can put the "PICTURES" label on it. At that point, it will show up alongside all the other picture-heavy columns. This will be potentially useful for later on. The labels I have designated for use (these could change, but probably won't much) are as follows:

- THOUGHTS - for things that I just thought, that aren't really grounded in any sort of reality
- STORYTIME - for stories
- OUTLINE - for outlines, bulleted lists, or otherwise intentionally structured posts (like this!)
- RESEARCH - if I'm researching something, this may not get used much
- PICTURES - if there is 3 or more pictures associated with the post
- DRAWINGS - if one of those pictures happens to be a drawing (I don't believe this has happened until this post)
- VIDEO - if the post contains a video (note: some of my old posts link to a version of my second-a-day video that no longer exists... so... yeah)
- AUDIO - if I post spoken word, music, or whatever other audio clip I might post - this is one of the many areas of media production and creativity I am looking into 
- POETRY - another area of media production and creativity I'm looking into
- JOKES - for thoughts that are simply jokes, from my own brain
- NERDCRED - nerdy post contect
- GOOGLE - Google-related content
- NONGOOGLETECH - for all other tech that isn't directly about Google
- META - columns that reference the column
- Possibly more to come if I start writing consistently about some other topic
for example - "REVIEWS" or "MOVIES" or "MONKEYSDRESSEDASHUMANS"

The substance of the conversation happening in the hallway outside my door right now does not warrant how loud the conversation is. Some girl somewhere is mad at some other girl, apparently. 

In the name of brevity, I'm afraid we must part ways. If I don't go to bed I'm going to regret it - maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday.

I have a small stockpile of drawings I did when I was in High School. This is one.

The past three posts were all written somewhat simultaneously. I assumed you’d enjoy 3 long posts more than one *giant* one.

# To Cloud or Not to Cloud, that is the Question

Here's a topic I've continually waffled on: is it better to live in the cloud or on local machines? There are, of course, pros and cons with any sort of decision. Every so often I like to reweigh decisions I’ve made. Now is one of those times.

## The Cloud

The “cloud” isn't a cloud. It's not even that complicated in theory, so the fact the name “the cloud” caught on is a bit strange to me. Your data in “the cloud” is actually just in a computer (or several) that is somewhere else in the world. I've been in these building before. They are often nondescript building hiding in plain sight amongst other businesses. Inside of them there are a series of aisles like you'd see at a grocery store, except all of the shelves are filled with rack-mounted computers. 

![[439-1.jpg]] 

The app you're using knows where your data is. When your app makes a request for that picture you took yesterday, it goes through a series of computers that do lookups and authentication/authorization steps, finds the closest computer that has the file, then returns that file in response to your request. 

Boom the cloud. 

### Why Think about It?

On a long enough timeline, the survival rate of any digital resource you depend on will drop to zero. I dumped a **lot** of energy and effort into Google Tasks, only to have that killed. I advocated for Google+, only to have that shuttered. Suddenly I started looking at my website, which was hosted in Blogger, and decided I shouldn’t hold my breath. While it is easy (and justified) to single out Google here - they are by no means the only potential issue here. Reddit, a key backbone of information gathering for me, has made some wildly questionable decisions recently. When their site effectively went dark, I realized how locked-in to that mode of operating I was. One of my tried-and-true workflows ceased to produce results for reasons I had no control over.  

### The Notion Problem

I love Notion. Around 4 years ago I started transitioning more and more of my daily life into a system with Notion as the backbone. It’s a stellar app that takes a great concept, the “block”, and builds on it extensively with all sorts of features that maintain its core conceptual integrity. It feels like every design decision was made with such love and care… and yet there’s nothing in the terms of service[^1] that says “WE GUARANTEE TO STILL BE AROUND TOMORROW”. 

### Why is the Cloud Popular?

Since the cloud is just “some else’s computer”, how much of your life are you trusting to this faceless group of people? Your photos, once they leave your phone and go to the cloud, are not *yours* any more. If they were suddenly deleted, or you were locked from your account, that’s pretty much it. They are just gone.

And yet, a **huge** portion of modern tech lives in “the cloud”. Think about how “useful” your phone feels when it doesn’t have service.

So why?

Well, basically that’s just the way the industry is moving. There are a litany of reasons, mostly boring ones - but it boils down to “the cloud” easier on consumers and easier on developers. There’s nothing simpler than taking a photo on your phone, then looking at it on Google Photos 2 minutes later on your laptop. You’re not installing a chat app on your machine, you’re going to Facebook. You’re not renting DVDs anymore. You’re clicking a button. There's nothing simpler for a developer to write some little app and have it hosted on AWS, Firebase, or Azure (just to name a few).

## Local

Local is just what it sounds like: using the computer in front of you. Using the machine in your hand. Your phones’s built-in calculator doesn't call back to Apple HQ or Google to ask what 2+2 is. That's done on-device. Your computer can do a **ton** of things, and yet more and more we are delegating those tasks to someone else's.

![[439-2.jpg]]

### Apple versus Google

There is an interesting dichotomy afoot when it comes to the two most talked about tech companies - Google and Apple have completely opposing business incentives and company ethos. 

It serves Google's interests to move as many people as fully to the cloud as possible; and they can make an ethical argument that by doing so they've very successfully lowered the barrier-to-entry to all sorts of capabilities and features. You no longer have to but $1000 machine and a multi-hundred dollar license to install Microsoft Office, you just need a cheap-as-dirt Chromebook and access to `docs.google.com`. Google's business model incentivizes them to make it as easy and desireable as possible to put as much of your life in the cloud as possible.

It serves Apple's interests to move as many people as fully to using their on-device operations as possible; and they can make an ethical argument that by doing so they've advocated for your privacy. They've kept your data *yours*. They are offering the best-in-class products and don't need to bog down your experience with advertisements... they just need you to replace your aging hardware with a fresh new *iWhatever* every couple of years. Apple's business model incentivizes them to make it as easy and desireable as possible to put as much of your life in your physical Apple devices as possible.

### Advantages of Local

Local compute offers a number of advantages. 

- It works without an internet connection
- Privacy - nobody needs to know how many Darkwing Duck revival scripts I've been writing[^2] but me
- It *can* be faster, no matter how quick your internet connection is, there are certain situations where reading from your local disk will provide better performance
- Durability - so long as I have a copy of my file on my machine and on another trusted local device, it’s probably going anywhere

### Drawbacks of Local

There are many reasons why “the cloud” is better a better paradigm. This is an incomplete list. 

- I have accidentally killed my own files before. I've never once had Google just “lose” One of my files. If I dropped my Chromebook out a moving car window, no big deal!
- The cloud becomes your single source of truth. When you have a federated file system and each device is equally entitled to be “the source of truth”, you run into sync issues. This opens up multiple new failure points. Sync issues become much more frequent if each device you own claims equal right to having “the correct version” of a thing.
- Honestly, setting up my Alexa-enabled devices has been easier and worked more consistently than setting up my HomeKit devices.

## So What

There are certain things that I no longer want to be dependent on “the cloud” for survival:

- My personal memories - photos, videos, life-tracking data
- My body of permanent notes

There are another category of things I no longer want going to “the cloud” at *all*:

- My smart home stuff, like all of it.

I’m going to take some proactive steps to be less dependent on invisible machines in hot rooms scattered throughout the globe.

- DONE:
    - Migrating my website off Blogger to something that lives on my hard drive & is pushed to the cloud (some several years back)
    - Procuring a Network-Attached Storage device, for an added degree of freedom in redundancy handling
    - Migrating my personal body of Permanent Notes from Notion to a local, dedicated, markdown-based personal knowledge management application
- IN PROCESS:
    - Developing a local-first version of my “Personal Data Warehouse”
    - Developing a platform-agnostic framework for my Columns, and probably moving this website to a new framework
- SOON:
    - Creating quarterly local backups of my Google Photos
- EVENTUALLY/MAYBE:
    - Move away from cloud-first smart home products

# Notion → Obsidian

I pulled the trigger on moving my notes off Notion to the best alternative, Obsidian.

![[439-3.jpg]]

## How

I used a bulk export of my “Notes” database from Notion to Markdown & CSV. This is *great* and honestly gets you 90% of the way there, but does come with some caveats/annoyances. Every file includes the 16-character UUID that uniquely identified the block, for example. I used [this script](https://github.com/connertennery/Notion-to-Obsidian-Converter) to handle some immediate, obvious cleanup activities; but that script doesn’t handle some specific things I needed for my use. Thankfully I have a superpower and wrote 180 lines of JavaScript of my own to do things like move data from the Frontmatter to the body of the notes, handle some remaining cleanup, and enforce some formatting.

## Niceties of Obsidian over Notion for Permanent Notes

Notion is a Swiss Army knife, a multi-tool. It’s a damn good one - probably the best - but like all multi-tools, each of their individual functions just aren’t *quite* as good as a tool designed specially for the job. Obsidian’s bread and butter is **exactly** my use case. Square peg, square hole. Here are some nice features:

- **Note aliases** - I have lived with some weird English in Notion when I’m using a Note’s title in a sentence where it doesn’t really fit. Now I don't have to decide if the note should be the acronym or the full phrase - it can be both.
- **Code-friendly** - I am able to write code to iterate through my notes & do things to them.
- **Unlinked-mentions** - Obsidian can recognize if a note is mentioned in another note, but not linked to it
- **Graph View** - everyone who builds a network of notes **loves** seeing it.
- **Excalidraw** - that white boarding app I said I’d love to use, well it’s very nicely integrated in.

# Life

My next post won’t be about tech stuff. Promise (cause I’ve already written a lot of it).



# Top 5: Factors to weigh when deciding on whether or not to use the Cloud



## 5. Do you have the option?

Honestly lots of great things are **only** local or **only** in the Cloud. There is not a local version of Notion. I know. I’ve checked. Also there’s not a cloud-based video editor that’s as easy to use as what’s on this computer.



## 4. Do you care if others see what you’re doing?

Cause they will. Unless you’re using end-to-end encryption, which is implemented by them and something you’re just going to have to trust that they did a good job of. 



## 3. How badly will you want to access the thing in 10 years?

Of all the cloud services I can think of, there are only **few** that I’d wager will be around in a not-too-dissimilar-form in 10 years. If you care about it deeply, your best bet is probably to have *both* local and cloud-based copies of the thing. That’s what I do for most of my stuff.



## 2. How many different devices do you need to access this information from?

If you **only** have a phone, it's pretty easy to just let your photos live in your phone[^3] and always have them in the device you're using. If you've got a gross number of devices like me, dropping a task on one device and picking it up on another becomes more and more common. This tends to favor cloud-based workflows, as much as Apple would love for iCloud's file syncronization to be magically seamless, it's just not.



## 1. Are you willing to live with more subscriptions?

Everything is a subscription now. I understand the need for an enduring revenue stream. I write code for goodness sake… but some tools are just so **basic** that they realistically could be considered “done”. Finito. Charge once and never update your app again.

This is **not** a "rebuild of my system". It is a codification of how my productivity/information management system has evolved naturally since [[401|Column 401 - AIM Revisited]].[^1]

![[468-1.png]]

That's the gist. But if you want more detail - here goes:

# Why the Tool Change?

The tool change was not intentional. It just sort of *happened*. One day I realized "oh, I just don't use Notion any more."

## Notion is Better

Notion is excellent. I can't say enough good things about it. Notion is a better tool for **most** people, I'd wager. 

Notion's databases are its killer feature. They are incredible, and no other tool has anything that really approaches what Notion's they allow you to do. They alone make Notion much easier to build systems than in Obsidian. In Notion, all of your content is always there. You don't have to worry about which device you're using and keeping things in sync like you do in Obsidian. Notion has a polished and consistent design language, great multi-user support, and so many cool tricks up its sleeve - with more coming all the time. I think for a huge majority of users, Notion is the better choice.

## ...Unless Obsidian "Clicks" with You

> [!tip] Notion is better - *unless* you happen to "click" with Obsidian.

Despite everything I just said, despite the interface being clunky, despite not having databases, despite having to glob on all sorts of 3rd party tools to fill in its cracks, **Obsidian is easily my favorite tool**. Obsidian "clicks" with me in a way no other tool has. When I use Obsidian, I feel like the tool just *goes away*. I feel like it's me working with the *content* **directly**. The tool I'm using takes up no part of my mental load. Obsidian makes [flow](https://gillespedia.com/Flow) happen in a way that Notion never quite did. Once you get over a certain hump, Obsidian becomes the fastest tool in your arsenal. You never have to take your hands off the keyboard to do *anything*. If you want Obsidian to do a thing, there's typically a way to make it do that thing.

I started using Obsidian for more and more things, until one day I just realized I no longer used Notion for anything. I doesn't feel like "I made the switch". It feels like "the switch" just *happened*.

# Aaron Information Management

2024 was a year in which my personal system(s) fluctuated **wildly**. Since 2025 is [[467#2025 Theme Let it Be|The Year of Letting it Be]],[^2] I'm hoping what I present here doesn't change much in the next 12 months. In order to keep everything as [lean](https://gillespedia.com/LEAN+Manufacturing) as possible, I took a very use-case-focused approach. This is what resulted from me starting with "what does the system **need to do?**" rather than "what tools should be in it?"

## What I Need Out of a Productivity System

These five use cases are what drives the system. I need:

1. A quick and easy inbox to capture ideas and tasks
2. Something to surface tasks and events when they are due
3. A place to put notes and tasks about things I am doing or would like to do
4. A structure supporting a weekly review
5. A structure for capturing quantified-self data for tracking, trending, & goal-setting

## Tools

![[468-2.png]]

This toolset approaches [perfect tool](https://gillespedia.com/More+is+Unnecessary%2C+Less+is+Impossible.) territory for me. Every tool that's there fills a vital role. The "system" doesn't do everything. It does **[enough](https://gillespedia.com/Enough)**. See the [[#Quote]].

## How It Works

![[468-3.png]]

### Inbox

I have Apple devices on me essentially 24/7. At any point I can say "Hey Siri Remind Me..." and then say whatever. I can share links or text to Reminders. Boom. Inbox. Easy.

> [!quote] Hey Siri Remind Me to make a demo of these five things

Every so often (& always during my [[#Structure for Weekly Review|weekly review]]) I deal with everything in the Reminders "Inbox" list.[^3]

### Surface Dated Tasks & Events

I use my phone's calendar for events and have a list in Reminders called "Scheduled" for anything with a hard due date or a location-based reminders set.

> [!quote] Hey Siri New Event for Thursday 9am titled go to store for work potluck

I use the standard built-in calendar widget on my phone homescreen. This keeps upcoming events & reminders front-of-mind.

![[468-9.jpeg]]

### Personal Project Management

Here is where the standard iOS/Mac productivity suite just doesn't quite cut the mustard.

> [!quote] Hey Siri New Project... set up playdate

A [Project](https://gillespedia.com/Defining+Project) is just a thing you want to do that takes multiple steps. You can also think of projects as "Objectives" you want to accomplish. I like to have a place to keep a list of the things I am working toward (e.g. - "Revert Tracker", below). In GTD vernacular this is my [Project List](https://gillespedia.com/Project+Lists).

For me, **each project is a markdown file** in a folder (using Obsidian). The project list is the folder itself.

#### Notes & Tasks

Each of the project files is a place to keep tasks and [project notes](https://gillespedia.com/Note+Types#Project+Notes). This collocates the objective with all the relevant tasks and info I need to accomplish it. I don't have tasks/notes strewn about multiple places. I can see everything related to the project at once.

#### Folders

Each project note is kept in a folder in accordance with its lifecycle state. 

- **Active** - things I'm doing now
- **Prospective** - things I will (perhaps) do at some point
- **Hold** - things I have a reminder set to work on at a specific point
- **Archive** - things I've done

#### Template

I use a **very** simple template for projects.

```markdown
# Result

# Scope

# Workspace
```

> [!question] What goes in each section?
> - **Result**: I include a "results" section because of how many times I revisit a completed project's materials only to ask "okay, what actually came out of this? Where did I put it?" When I complete a project, I make quick note of what the outcome was or where it is.
> - **Scope**: Any clarification beyond the project's title for *what* it is, often a checklist.
> - **Workspace**: Full of whatever content is helpful. It's literally the space where the work happens.

Here's an example of a completed project file:

![[468-10.png]]

#### Next Actions Overview

If my tasks are stored *inside* the notes for each project, how do I get an overview of all the tasks I could be doing? To get this list of [Next Actions](https://gillespedia.com/Next+Action)  I utilize Obsidian's tagging feature. I don't want every single checkbox I make to show up, only those tagged with `#next`. 

For example:

```markdown
- [ ] Edit podcast #next
```

I use this in combination with Obsidian's awesome [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin to create a centralized list of all the outstanding `#next` actions. The dataview code for this:

```plaintext
Task
Where contains(tags, "#next")
Where status = " "
Group by file.link
```

Yielding a list of "Next Action" tasks grouped by the Project they're in:

![[468-12.png]]

I use a pinned tab on my "Home" page as a sidebar in Obsidian. This is a landing spot for quick links,[^4] next actions, and my active project list.

![[468-13.png]]

### Structure for Weekly Review

The [weekly review](https://gillespedia.com/Weekly+Review) is the lynchpin of my productivity system. I've used calendar events & recurring tasks before, but I like the ability to have a spot to accumulate thoughts/tasks/whatever throughout the week that I want to review. This lead me to an Obsidian-based weekly review.

> [!tip]
> You can use Obsidian's built-in "Daily Notes" plugin as a *weekly* notes by changing "Date format" to `GGGG-[W]ww`: 
> ![[468-8.png]]

My weekly review note template is very minimal.

```markdown
# Goals
%set some goals for the week%
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
# Weekly Review
- [ ] Inbox Zero
- [ ] Preview calendar ahead
- [ ] Review Projects List
- [ ] Create next week's weekly page
# Notes
%place to put things throughout the week for weekly review%
```

Hopefully showing the template there is enough for you to figure out how my process there works.

### Quantified Self Structure

See [[Data Journal]]. TL;DR - A Google Sheets workbook with a few sheets for things and Siri Shortcuts that make capturing data easy. 

> [!quote] Hey Siri Track Workout...

I look at my Data Journal spreadsheet every night to input a summary of the day. This keeps me honest and aware of trends like the fact I haven't worked out in 7 days.

## What About Goals?

I no longer have a **formal** system for managing goals. Having something separate just isn't all that necessary. I've got my annual year in review Column wherein I establish longer-term goals (like KPIs on the Data Journal data), and beyond that all my goals are bound to a project. 

## Conclusion

That concludes it[^5]. 

# Top 5: Siri Shortcuts + Obsidian Pro Tips

Shortcuts is awesome and doesn't get the credit it deserves. It can superpower Obsidian, too!

## 5.  Quick Search

Do a search on your vault with your voice or Spotlight.

![[468-4.png]]

## 4. Home Screen Icons for each Vault

Have more than one vault in Obsidian? Use a Siri Shortcut "Open URL" action to open the vault you want, and add the shortcut to your home screen to get to them in one tap. These three purple icons each open one of my 3 Obsidian vaults.

![[468-5.jpeg]]

## 3. Home Screen Icons for Specific Notes

You can use the same trick as above to add an icon to open **directly to specific notes** within a Vault. You could have an icon to take you to your project list note, or a general home page, or both! My "Journal" icon takes me to a `🏡 Home` page in the vault.

## 2. Append Content to a Note

If you have an "Inbox" note, or (like shown below) you use a Daily Note, you can easily append new lines (or tasks) to it using a shortcut. This takes advantage of the fact that notes are just *text files*. You're technically not touching Obsidian at all, just appending to a file upon which it operates.

> [!tip]
> Use the "Append to Text File" action rather than Obsidian's URI + "Open URL" method. The Open URL method requires the phone to be unlocked, whereas the append to text file can run while the phone is locked.

![[468-6.png]]

## 1.  Add New Notes

You can also use shortcuts to create an entirely new note. This example includes 3 "Ask for Text" prompts to fill out my project template, then saves it as a Markdown file in my "Projects/Prospective" folder. 

![[468-7.png]]

Hello there.

I decided to roll back to a previous habit in my life - this thing I did during high school to help pass the time and get my thoughts out of my head. I wrote them down on the internet (web) on some sort of a log (log). Basically, I am a hipster blogger. I blogged before blogging was cool. Before “microblogging” (twitter), before Facebook permeated everything about everybody’s online lives. I wanted something to get thoughts out of my head so I could move on with my day. This is why I had a column in high school. I posted stuff I thought about and a respectable number of people (read:2) would sometimes read it.

I got into college about five years ago and quickly found out I wasn’t bored enough to write much anymore. Most of my time was spent trying to understand calculus and physics or hanging out with my roommate/girlfriend. The importance of sitting down to write a formalized list of my thoughts and what’s been happening diminished with increasing levels of “whoa, I have other stuff to do!”

However, with changing times, life circumstances, technology, and social trends it seems possible again to go back to my old ways.

Tumblr Blogger + Android Phone ubiquity + smaller scope blogging + finally learning how to manage time = ability to start writing some again.

So, I decided to restart this thing I used to do… Slightly modified, of course.

I can’t tell you a lot about what this is going to ‘be’ or ‘do’, but I can tell you that it’s going to evolve into something and accomplish something. Even if that something is nothing.

Logical contradictions included free of charge.

## Self-Interview:

Q) So, why now?

Because I can. Because I realized that Tumblr is perfect for what I had in mind.

Q) What’s different now from before?

I’m older.

Q) Why do this thing again?

Because I felt like it. I can’t explain why. Get off my back.

# Motto: [Corn is Always Interesting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FWBxVis49M)

**Two big things since my last update:**
1. My Nexus 7 arrived, straight from Google
2. I went to Kearney, Nebraska to visit my sister and her still-new husband

## 1 - The Nexus 7

I got my second Android tablet and second Nexus device, the Nexus 7. For those of you who don't know, it is a 7-inch Android tablet that has all top-of-the-line specifications and doesn't break the bank. The thing cost $200, and runs faster both my phone and my old Asus Transformer 10-inch Android tablet. I sold the Transformer (not because it was bad, it was actually quite good... I just didn't use it as much as I would a 7-inch tablet) and I don't think I'm going to regret it. 

The 7-inch form factor fits in to my system so much nicer than the full 10-inch tablet did. It feels more personal. It feels more like an extension of my being (I've regarded my phone in this manner for some time now) than did the Transformer.

The root and general hackery of my new tablet starts on the morrow. It's going to be a nice little Tuesday. Also tomorrow - Lunch with my mother and oldest sister followed by The Dark Knight Rises and general man-time with Jon and possibly Josh.

I just installed Splashtop streamer, an app that lets you access your entire computer from your android device, essentially turning my $200 Nexus 7 into an ultraportable gateway to my Windows 7 computer. This is the most blown away I've been with technology since I first powered on my OG Droid almost three years ago. It was well worth the $7.99 I paid for it. Here's what I'm talking about:

(editor's note from 2020: this vieo was lost to time)

- Side note: That video was taken on my phone, edited on my computer (via my Nexus 7 using Splashtop, just cause I could), then uploaded to Youtube (unlisted) just for this post. I just made a video for the column. I doubt this will be the only time this happens. Future videos I hope to make more entertaining?

## 2 - A Trip to Nebraska

I visited my younger older sister and new brother-in-law in Nebraska this weekend. I'm ashamed to say that this is the first time I've done so... she's lived there for a while now. Going was a "Yes Man" moment for me. Something I wouldn't normally do because normally I'd prefer to be boring; and I'm very glad I went. The "Yes Man" thing is still showing positive repercussions. This is a contrary to the "YOLO" movement, which has done nothing for the youth of today other than create more of them. That was a joke about "YOLO" leading to unwanted pregnancies. It was poorly constructed.

Anyway - Nebraska was good times. I, among other things, played disc golf and went bowling with James and Amy. I don't want to talk about who won either of those games. Don't ask. I got to experience "Cruise Night", which is a day in which hundreds of old and fancy cars flood the town of Kearney, NE and everyone shows their appreciation by drinking in public. The three of us didn't participate in the drinking, but we definitely drove around and saw what there was to see. I saw a parade in fast-forward, then had to watch the whole thing at normal speed. The most important thing that happened while I was down there: I got to talk and spend some time with Amy and James.

I listened to "Invisible Monsters" by Chuck Palahniuk (the author of Fight Club) during my drive. I determined two things; the first is that road trips are made infinitely better by listening to audiobooks. The second thing I determined was that Chuck Palahniuk's writings are entirely entertaining, if not entirely wacko. Where he comes up with this stuff is beyond comprehension. 
- Side note: I listened to the audiobook on my tablet through my car's speakers. One of its first great uses.

My mind is right.
On a related and opposite note: It's almost 3 in the morning. I'm calling this one.

# Top 5: Zen Moments, in photos (I like these photo edition top 5's)

This Column is an expansion on [Column #427](http://aarongilly.com/427/). I'll save some fun topics for the Miscellany section below, if you'd prefer to skip to that.

# The Theme

“Put more wood behind fewer arrows”, is advice I’ve seen originally attributed to Scott McNealy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. It is my primary theme for 2023; but I could have chosen:

- You can do anything, but not everything
- If everything is a priority then nothing is

The all of which boil down to focus more on what’s most important to you and let everything else slide. What commitments *(be they hobbies, objects to maintain, or events to attend)* “spark joy” for you? Are you maximizing those, or putting them in conflict with other, less important things? 

Several themes from all the books I've read and distilled down to my various [](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea) lead to this realization:



👉 I was doing too much. See the **Top 20** for proof.

If you only **do** a few things, it's easier to do them well, maintain a high level of success, and not encounter unnecessary stress. If you only **have** a few things, it's easier to keep them in good condition and running order. After a very basic threshold is met, each additional thing you do or own brings with it a diminishing return to your happiness and quality of life. Each new calendar event or physical obligation brings with it 100% of its overhead, but only some fraction of its intended value.[^0]

## Fewer Arrows

To make room in my life, some things are falling by the wayside.

- I am taking a break from doing **30 Day Challenges**. They weren’t receiving the focus they needed to be successful, which made them useless.
- I will no longer be posting a **[Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b)**. I’ll transition into a more relaxed “Creations of the Whenever” approach. If I make something I like and want to share, it will pop up there.
- I am going to stop using my own NPM module “**wrapper-lib**” in my projects, thereby not feeling obligated to maintain it[^1].
- I don’t plan on writing any new [Gillespedia](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/) articles for the foreseeable future.
- My podcast is now defunct. No new episodes will be produced. Dunno if I will remain podcast-less. I did enjoyed that.
- I’m going to pare down my tracking a bit in the Personal Data Warehouse.

![A Caption on this Tree, just to see how that gets handled.](assets/428-2.jpg)

A Caption on this Tree, just to see how that gets handled.

## More Wood

So why cull those things? To have more time to do these.

- Taking care of my body & mind - getting proper rest & exercise
- Being a good father & husband
- Keeping up with my personal productivity system (personal task & project management)
- Maintaining Streaks in the Streaks app, which is meant to help me do all of the above
- Finishing the house projects that have all stalled out
- Continuing to learn proper web development & other coding stuff

## More or Less the Same

The Column, my Notes, and my work on making puzzles is just about right.

# Miscellany

## Avatar 2

Dang that was a good looking movie. Here are my other thoughts about it:

## My Workout Routine

With my recently rejuvenated back, I'm back into lifting. There are hundreds or thousands of different workout routines. I've tried several, but keep going back to the same basic format. It looks like this:

A day with:  
- **Squats → Bench Press → Pull Up**

And a day with:  
- **Deadlift → Bent over Rows → Overhead Press**

The sets & reps scheme every day looks like:

1. large number of sets of low reps 
2. medium number of sets of medium number of reps 
3. small number of sets of a large number of reps
4. accessory lifts

And I rotate all exercises through all the sets & reps ranges on six successive days. 

If that was confusing - it looks like this:

| **Day 1**               | **Day 2**             | **Day 3**              | **Day 4**            | **Day 5**        | **Day 6**            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 4 min warm up           | 4 min warm up         | 4 min warm up          | 4 min warm up        | 4 min warm up    | 4 min warm up        |
| Squat - 5x5             | Deadlift - 5x5        | Bench - 5x5            |  Row Variant - 5x5   | Pull-up 5xAMRAP  | Overhead Press - 5x5 |
| Bench - 4x7             | Row Variant - 4x7     | Assisted Pull-up - 4x7 | Overhead Press - 4x7 | Squat - 4x7      | Deadlift - 4-7       |
| Assisted Pull-up - 2x15 | Overhead Press - 2x15 | Squat - 2x15           | Deadlift - 2x15      | Bench - 2x15     | Row Variant- 2x15    |
| Curl variant            | Tricep exercise       | Shoulder exercise      | Curl variant         | Tricep exercise  | Shoulder exercise    |
| Curl variant            | Tricep exercise       | Shoulder exercise      | Curl variant         | Tricep exercise  | Shoulder exercise    |

I rotate through those days. Try to work out 3x per week. Each workout takes about 45 minutes. And I like it. Am I strong? No not at all.

## JavaScrypt

[This is a cool website](https://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/example.html). As a dude that makes puzzles and knows web development stuff to some extent. This in-browser encryption/decryption tool is dope. 

Check it out. I used the encryption key “password1” for this:

```

## “Puzzle” Disambiguation

Any uncontrolled language's[^2] grammar, syntax, and words all change constantly in response to the needs and creativity of its speakers. English, like the vast majority of languages, is subject to these little evolutions. And yet…

There isn't a clean way to say “puzzles, but not like *jigsaw* puzzles necessarily - but *escape-room* style puzzles… but not specifically Escape Rooms. Any sort of puzzles where part of the puzzle is figuring out what the puzzle is… or that a puzzle even *exists. Essentially* tricky things in all forms”.

Why isn't there a word for that? Why must I choose between being ambiguous or having to awkwardly say “puzzles, but not like jigsaw puzzles necessarily… I mean they are fine too but you know… other puzzles too.“

Solving problems and coming up with novel ideas seem like central skills to people who consume and create puzzles. Let's think of a new word. Or agree as a population that the word “puzzles” in absence of a preceding “jigsaw” does **not** mean jigsaw puzzles.



# Top 20: Commitments I Was Attempting to Maintain



**20. Maintaining my finances**

Paying bills, tracking spending, categorizing transactions



**19. Exercising my Personal Productivity System**

Keeping a project list, goals, inbox zero, and weekly reviews. See [Column 385](https://aarongilly.com/385/).



**18. Maintaining Streaks in the [Streaks app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id963034692)**

Streaks is simply a habit tracker. It's a good way to keep yourself honest when routines can't happen.



**17. Creating a Podcast**

Doing the homework, scheduling, recording, often editing & posting.



**16. Maintaining the list of [Tools](https://www.notion.so/Tools-41615f02a1cf4f5e80f29261a5484579) I'm actively using**

I just updated that, by the way.



**15. Posting a “Creation of the Week”**

This is being demoted to 'the Creation Catalog', which will only be updated when I feel like highlighting something I've made anyway.



**14. Writing Gillespedia articles from time to time**

This is being demoted to the archive of this site. I may revive it at some point.



**13. Holding 30 Day Challenges**

These are good if you’re doing literally nothing else. Put all your energy into doing whatever random thing you want for 30 days. This is being shuttered for now.



**12. My “Wrapper-Lib” coding project/NPM Module**

I’m aware that nobody reading this knows what this is. It's a coding library I made. I'm going to not do it anymore and use other libraries.



**11. Creating the 10th iteration of “The Life Tracker”, dubbed “the PDW”**

This is still happening.



**10. Actively using the PDW to track a litany of things**

I'm going to knock off a few of the things I don't care to track any more.



**9. Get in to Win - my puzzle making project**

The prototype puzzle is done. The first “real” puzzle is a major goal of mine for 2023.



**8. The Column itself**

This thing! Nothing's changing here.



**7. Reading and keeping my body of [](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea)**

These are cool and I hope to do this for my whole life. I do **not** look forward to the day where I decide Notion isn’t stable enough for me to depend on.



**6. Maintaining a home/actively updating it**

I guess I'll keep doing this.



**5. All the stuff that goes into my job**

I have a job, too.



**4. Managing an autoimmune disease**

Thankfully this isn’t much of an issue right now.



**3. Maintaining my health, outside of #4**

Tied with #1 and #2



**2. Being a good husband**

Tied with #1 and #3



**1. Being a good dad**

Tied with #2 and #3

# Motto: Prevention is 16 times more effective than cure, by weight.

Working out: What happened? I have been throttling my workouts on a bi-weekly basis. Every other week I work out the amount that I aspire to... the remaining weeks I work out as much as the average* American does: None at all.

*this is average by mode, which is not my preferred averaging method.

Something I forgot to mention in my last post: I ordered the Nexus 4. Shipping is expected within the next 2 to 3 weeks, so hopefully I will get that before Christmas time.

Day 3 without Facebook or (copious amounts of) Reddit: I woke up this morning gasping for air. The cold sweat left its mark on the pillow where my face indention usually resides. I realized shortly after waking that it wasn't actually air that I was missing, it was stupid internet sites. Knowing sleep was no longer an option, I forced myself into the shower. I fought less than usual for a desirable temperature before taking in the water's warm then cold then hot then freezing then warm embrace. I hung my head in it. Looked down at the drain next to my foot and tried to imagine all the water swirling itself away were the minutes I had wasted, sitting, staring at a glowing rectangle. Somewhere, off in the distance, a dog barked.

I don't write much.

I updated my [second-a-day video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7hAJM1y0WE) through December. So, watch that if you feel like it.

I'm going to leave this extra short and sweet. I'll also leave it a visual representation of my current progress in my fitness goals:

# Motto: dnekeeW sdrawkcaB A

I don't have much to say today. 

If you enjoy things that are funny, you should watch this video:

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE - this video is gone now. :-(

I was the top post on Reddit's "r/tall" sub a few days back. I posted this picture:

![](assets/115-1.jpg)

That picture has been viewed over 25 thousand times, according to the hosting service.

I've been taking a break from Life Tracking lately. I'm not sure where the motivation went, but it's certainly gone somewhere. I do have 14 full weeks tracked, but I've been supposedly doing this since 21 weeks ago. 

My original goal was to do it for a year... or half a year at least. That's going to take a while when I keep taking weeks off.

I've turned Melissa into a fellow Dominion player. She beat be today... two times... out of two games.

In order to keep with what I normally write about, I should probably just say this:
Apple iPhone 5S. Samsung Smartwatch. GoPro action camera. Fitness. Fitness. Android. Fitness.

Oh, and I should mention that I have received several bits of fantastic news lately that has made my week awesome. None of those things are really my business to write about, though. Just use your imagination.

HI!  
  
I don't write as much any more. That's just the way things are, and the way they will likely continue to be. It's my official/unofficial policy not to talk about wishing I wrote more. I don't wish that. I write exactly as much as I wish I wrote. See the Top 5 for reasons Columns have dropped down to once every few weeks.  
  
Side benefit of less frequent posts: my quotes are of a higher quality.  
  
Have you heard of the Amazon Echo? It's a discrete little cylinder, slightly bigger than an energy drink can, but smaller than a two liter bottle. It's a consumer electronic device without a screen. How novel! People who have them love them, apparently. The various tech-related podcasts I listen to talk about it every week. I met a dude who owned one. He reflected the common sentiment. Why isn't there an Apple version? Why isn't there a Google cylinder?  
  
I'm watching KU's Sweet 16 game. We are about to win over Maryland. By the time I post again, the tournament will likely be over. I hope we win.  
  
Batman V Superman is officially out. I could be watching that right now instead of writing this, but I don't care enough to try to fight opening-night crowds. Maybe tomorrow. Early reviews seem to point to a common set of highlights and lowlights. Common review score: "meh/10". It looks like Civil War basically has to just show up to play to be better.  
  
I'm good. I'm still pumped about the routine. I'm genuinely enjoying my 9-5 every weekday. I come home to a beautiful woman whom I adore. I have a pair of cats that do stupid stuff and make me laugh. Marvel movies are on the horizon & the second season of Daredevil delivered. My back isn't really bothering me, despite taking almost no anti-inflammatories. I'm getting a bit stronger each time I go to the gym. My work basketball team is doing really well. I'm arguably playing better than ever before. I'm eating better and sleeping better. Really I've been riding a streak of generally good days for quite a while. Like everyone, I'll let a bad day in - but they they can't keep me down.  
  
My goal for this post was to say a bunch of good things and make you, the reader, simultaneously bored and disdainful.  
  
Naw. Not really. I don't say how good things are because that's typically boring to hear, but it needs to be said from time to time. I appreciate this life I've got.  
  
Looking through my recent photos, there's not much to post that isn't already on my Instagrams. So I decided to dig into my "For the Column" folder to find an image representative of this Column. I couldn't decide between these two:

This Column is more squarely aimed at Aaron Gillespie as the target audience than most. Proceed with caution. We're going to cover the past, the present, and the future of "The Data Journal" - or if it's more fun to think about it this way, the past, present, and future of Aaron's mental breakdown.

# Why
A book I read 3 chapters of before giving up on told me to "start with why". So, *why* track dozens (eventually, over 100) data points in your every day life? What's the point? Why go through the effort of writing things down, analyzing data, learning to code, and keeping it up with it all?

Fear, mostly.  

Fear and boredom.  

I started "The Life Tracker" as it was then known a little over a year after I left college. I realized I was in a rut of going to work, coming home, wasting the night away, eating whatever, going to sleep whenever, then starting the cycle all over again. The way I was living I would have trudged through life, slowly forgetting things I once knew, as I got fatter and less engaged, and failed to acquire any amount of equity... and it was all on me to stop it. I was afraid of slowly becoming somebody I'd regret without realizing it.

Also, I wasn't really doing much else. Playing around in Excel seemed slightly more productive than playing around on a PS3.

## Enter the Data Journal  
The solution - write it **all** down. I didn't *really* know exactly what I needed, but as my high school science teacher once said:

> **"If you aren't measuring it, you aren't going to learn about it."**
<cite>John Torrence said something like this</cite>

So. I wrote it down. Rather than bore you to death with paragraphs of details that nobody in their right mind should read - here's some hand-drawn history for that VISUAL FLAIR!

# The Past a Visual History of the Data Journal

## V1

![One](assets/395-1.jpg)

## V2

Reason for new version: no need to carry around (and sometimes lose) a piece of paper and a pen.

![Two](assets/395-2.jpg)

## V3

Reason for new version: I got tired of typing in my daily food summaries, sleep details, and other things.

![Three](assets/395-3.jpg)

## V4

Reason for new version: I got tired of tracking the same 25 Daily Goals after 5 years. Was ready for what's next. Also I figured out how to use a free weather API.

![Four](assets/395-4.jpg)

## V5

Reason for new version: A couple more data points I thought might be nice.

![Five](assets/395-5.jpg)

## V6

Reason for new version: A redefinition/refinement of the new data points.

![Six](assets/395-6.jpg)

## V7

Reason for new version: Accommodating the switch from Android to iOS & getting into tracking at a finer granularity than "day".  

![Seven](assets/395-7.jpg)

## V8

Reason for new version: I realized I wasn't fat & that writing down what I ate wasn't really the reason why. I honed in more on self-actualization, rather than just self-sustainment.

![Eight](assets/395-8.jpg)

# The Present - V9

Reason for new version: A house divided against itself cannot stand. Tracking at both the daily and "realtime" level was causing data conflicts that I believed I could resolve by way of refactor.

![Nine](assets/395-9.jpg)

This, though, doesn't tell the whole story. Version 9 has not worked yet. Today, I got to the point where I expected to fully "transition" from V8 to the new normal... and it just fully went sideways.

Here's where I'd like to help the *maybe one person if I'm lucky* that will ever read this and benefit from it.

## How It Work(ed)

When the Data Journal worked well, it was set up such that **one row = one day**. This is the easiest, most natural way to do a quantified self/habit tracking/whatever you want to call it project. Each row corresponds to a given time period. The "Daily" sheet rolled up to "Weekly" and "Monthly" sheets. All of those rolled up to "Yearly" sheets.  The columns defined the measures I took. Data types were implicitly covered by cell number formatting. The formulas defined how those measures rolled up. 

Each morning a script I wrote would run and create space for new data. Each night, I input a Google Form which filled out that space with answers to questions I asked myself & data from the data services I learned to use.

In a graphic:  

![worked](assets/395-10.png)

## How It Doesn't Work

As soon as you remove the foundational principle upon which everything else was built, it all becomes *much* more difficult to manage. In other words: **one row ≠ one day** is an order of magnitude more cumbersome. Treating each row as an individual data point is not how spreadsheets are *meant* to operate. This contributes two compounding problems:

1. The data set that formulas have to look through for relevant data increases by dozen(s) of rows a day.
2. There are suddenly thousands more formulas to calculate, and they ALL are forced to recalculate each time data is changed.

Or, in a graphic:  

![doesn't](assets/395-11.png)

# The Future

There are 4 paths forward I can see:

![fourpaths](assets/395-12.jpg)

Choosing the path is where I sit today. I may do one. I may do them all, eventually. The question is back to "why". Why do I want to continue tracking things? Is it merely to continue having a journal of references? Is it because I care about correlations and metrics? Is it to force me to think about my life? Or is it for fun? or because I want to build a product?

Who knows. If you know what I want, please write in. [Email me here.](mailto:aarongilly@gmail.com).

# Top 10: Lessons I've Accidentally Learned in Service of Learning about Myself
1. **Not planning for failure is the same thing as planning to fail**. The first couple years of the tracking my system was completely intolerant of anything other than perfect data completeness for an entire week. When I inevitably lost data for a single *day*, the whole week had to go. Now I've got data gaps that are much wider and more noticeable than just missing *food* for a single day. Don't write yourself into a corner with what data you choose to track. Don't expect to know *today* all the data points that you'll care about in 5 years. Leave your system room to grow, shrink, or refocus as time goes by. 
2. **Tracking something is sometimes all the reason you need to make it successful**. I achieved many things simply because I didn't want to record a failure for a run of successive days.
3. **Tracking either needs to be easy - or important enough to be difficult**. Every data point I didn't fully automate that wasn't absolutely essential eventually got nixed.
4. **Subjective scales from 1 to 5 are less useful than ones from 1 to 10**. Neither of them are as useful as objective measures that tell the same story. "How do you feel, physically" is less useful than "what medicines did you have to take". The gold standard to aim for is a subjective qualification on top of an objective fact. "I ate Taco Bell today, and that's poor food" is better than "I ate poorly".
5. Tracking things is a great way to spot trends and correlations, for sure - but its **real value comes from forcing you to think about your life**. Are the things you do day-to-day aligned with your values and long-term ambitions? Track according to what's important to you. How can you measure your goals? How can you measure how well you're tending to the areas of responsibility in your life?
6. Another, more obvious, but less appreciated benefit of tracking things in your life is that **it serves as an incredible set of reference materials** for questions like "when did we buy the house?", "when was my last doctor's appointment?", "how long have I had this cough?", "when was the last time I saw my parents?" 
7. **Anything piece of data that isn't closely bound to time, shouldn't go into a time-indexed tracking system**. I tried, for a bit, to use the Data Journal to hold *everything*. Turns out that some notes are better organized by subject than by "when" they happened to get written down.
8. **Being good at spreadsheets can take you places**. My 4 year, multi-thousand dollar degree has helped me less in my day-to-day life than have the couple of weeks I've collectively spent learning how to use static references, why VLOOKUP is usually not the best option, and learning how to string together functions to do basically whatever I want. 
9. **Spreadsheet manipulation is an *awesome* place to learn basic scripting**. It's easy. It's self-contained. It's obvious how some simple coding can do incredibly powerful things.
10. I learned how to speak, write, and think in JavaScript + HTML + CSS. Also how to *learn* how to make APIs and new environments work. **If I stick with something long enough, I usually figure out how to make it work**. Or I find something else that does the job.

Motto: Reading is for Nerds

  
Yesterday marked more than just the first day of a new month, it marked the end of my second 30 Day Challenge. Here's a brief recap:  
  
February started off as the month **I wasn't going to use anything with a screen after 9pm**. That quickly changed. February became the month I was going to **read 5 books**. I made this change after a little less than a week. So, take a week off out of what's already the shortest month of the year, then give yourself the only goal you've thought of so far that actually becomes easier the longer you do it.  
  
Genius.  
  
I didn't read 5 books. I read less than 3.

I read those. I didn't even finish "What Would Google Do?" because I had trouble applying its message to my life.   
  
I failed.  
  
Doesn't mean I'm giving up. Failure is just one of the possible results of a challenge. Now, to move on to the next one. For more on that, check out the last paragraph of the body of this post.  
  
First, I have   

  
I am no longer a Google Fiber customer. This one change begets several other changes. See the Top 5 for those changes.

  
I realized yesterday that Google lets you back up everything people would commonly care to back up on their computers... for free. The vast majority of storage space in your average personal computer will be taken up by three things:

  
1\. Photos

2\. Music

3\. Videos

  
With Google's cloud, you can store (_and use_) all of these for free:  
  
  
1\. Photos - Google+ can automatically back up every photo you take on your phone. Similarly, Google's Picasa can automatically sync any photos from folder(s) you choose. If you choose to have them resized (to a maximum resolution of 2048x2048) they will not take up _any_ of your Google Drive storage. As with everything else in this list, these photos are kept private until _you_ choose to share them.  
2\. Music - Google Music lets you upload up to 20,000 songs from your computer into the cloud. From there, you can listen to them on (practically) any internet connected device.   
3\. Videos - Google+'s automatic photo backup also works for video - but hey, even if you didn't want to do that, you can always upload your home videos privately to YouTube.   
  
Whatever's left can be dumped in your 15 GB of free Google Drive storage.  
  
**The Next Challenge!**  
For the month of March, I will **write every day**. Either a column, or just something in my Moleskine, I'm going to write something every day. This one isn't much of a stretch, but that's by design. There's a lot going on this month. More on that in tomorrow's column. Yeah. I said that.

  
Top 5: Things that have Changed Since I'm No Longer a Google Fiber Subscriber

5\. I'm no longer the owner of a terabyte of Google Drive cloud storage. I'll either have to purchase storage to keep my 48 GB or figure out a different way to get Drive storage.  
4\. I figured out a different way to get Google Drive storage! It's coming in the mail on Wednesday. It's the Toshiba Chromebook. Comes with 100 GB Drive space for two years.  
3\. I no longer pay for any form of television. My TV will come through the air, like I did when I was growing up.  
2\. Actually, my TV will come through the internet. I subscribed to Hulu+ (in addition to my ongoing Netflix subscription). So I guess I'm paying for _some_ form of television. The Chromecast is being put to fantastic use.  
1\. Due to awesome work hookups, I'm paying much, much less than I did previously.

Motto: [Google is God](https://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/proof-google-is-god/)

  
There's a Google product you should know about; it's called [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout). It is **not** a food service, so don't get excited. Don't make the same joke that literally 5 people I've told about this have made.

  
Google Takeout is a service that allows you to _take out_ your data from Google - in theory so that you could go to some other service and keep your data. In reality, it's probably best just for seeing an aggregate list of everything they have of yours and about you. I requested an archive of everything they had associated with my account, leaving out Google Drive _(because I have 500GB+ in the cloud & don't need them to send me my own files back to me)_. Then I spent a week's worth of free time going through it all & taking 5 full pages of notes about what I found. This post is primarily the contents of those notes. Now, before we get into that.

  
I am pro-Google. I use or have used almost every one of their publicly-offered services Google is astounding. I was a Google Plus die-hard well beyond anyone reasonably should have been. I'm writing this from a desk with a little "Google" neon lamp on it... on a Google-developed browser... using Blogger. I think Google is a great and wonderful company that makes the world a better place. Google Takeout even re-instills my faith that the company is still living to their erstwhile motto: "Don't be evil". A company that goes through this much effort to enable you to not only see what they know about you, but also help you to take your business elsewhere... I think that's pretty great.

  
All that said...

  
Google is _**terrifying**_.

  
I know better than the average person off the street what Google _probably_ had on me. I'm technically minded. I'm an engineer. I write code for work and for fun. I have a Life Tracker, for God's sake... and yet I was still shocked and awed by the immensity of it all. 

  
**262 gigabytes** 

**148,172 files**

**4,552 folders**

  
Granted, a large proportion of those numbers (230, 111974, & 3903, respectively) fall to my Google Photos export. Take out Google Photos and the dataset is still 31.6GB, 36,196 files, in 647 folders. 

  
In there, are many things you'd expect to find: 

* all my photos from Google Photos
   * 54,035 photos & 57,939 metadata files
   * including my photos and photos from others I've added to my collection
   * Metadata including geographic coordinates, photo views, and any comments associated with them
* all my notes from Google Keep
   * 855 notes & 279 attached media files
* all my emails from Gmail
   * one 2.5GB lumped text file
   * weirdly not sorted in any order I can figure out
* all my chats from Hangouts
   * one 328MB, 10,277,395 line .json file
   * weirdly, chat is also in the Gmail file... same chats in both, different format
   * this includes both sides of the conversation, images are also included in separate files - but only the ones I sent, not the ones I received
* all the details for my contacts
   * one 60KB .vcf file & associated photos
* all my purchases made through Google Express
   * including what I bought, for how much, where it was delivered, how I paid
* every exercise session I ever logged with Google Fit
   * including what I did, when I did it, where I did it, and how far I traveled during
* my entire search history
   * split out by product (Search, developers, drive, analytics, apps, cloud, news, images, inbox, videos, maps, play store, and more)
* the content of every Blogger post I've ever made
   * this sentence will be in there after I hit "Publish"
* my browser history\*
   * one 10MB .json file
* my location history, which I'll expand on in a bit
   * I knew something had to power the [Google Timeline](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb)

_\*For some reason my browser history is incomplete. It only goes back to 2/11/2018, containing 26,334 URLs & timestamps_

  
All of those things I knew I'd find. The photos, notes, emails, chats, and contacts are all clearly needed in order for those services to function. The search history, browser history, and physical location history I also knew to expect, although their direct application is slightly less obvious.

  
But that's not everything that was in there. 

  
Things I found, but was not expecting:

* 11,500 audio recordings of me, all starting with "Okay Google..."

[![](assets/366-1.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cc1CpAeKKnw/XKFYoFCZXAI/AAAAAAADuC4/7rwMrF9CSaQccgidhAZfqoFuebex8abaACLcBGAs/s1600/Capture.PNG)

   * That's 15 hours, 52 minutes, and 41 seconds' worth of 5 seconds clip.
   * In these recording you hear me, but also anything else that was going on in the background.
   * Also there's an HTML file with a transcript of what it heard in each of these recordings, and a latitude/longitude for each.
* An HTML file showing every time I opened an app on my Android phone, sometimes also showing what I did in the app.

   * There's only 76 thousand records in that file - which can't possibly be everything I did on my old phone. I'm not sure what was & wasn't included.
* A log of every time I ever:
   * played a song on Google Play Music (including title & timestamp)
   * played a movie on Google Play Movies (including title & timestamp)
   * read a book on Google Play Books (including title & timestamp)
   * played a game on Google Play Games (including title & timestamp)
   * looked at an app on the Google Play Store (including title & timestamp)
   * installed an app from the Play Store (including what device, title & timestamp)
   * uninstalled an app (including what device, title & timestamp)
* A log of everything I bought NOT through Google Express, provided I received an emailed receipt of the translation.
   * Including what I bought, from who, for how much, and where it was delivered
   * Mostly this is a list of Amazon and Dominos pizza orders
   * Google wasn't involved in the transactions, these logs must come from the smart email parsing
* Google Fit health metrics, broken out into 15 minute chunks, for every day.

   * those columns are distance traveled, average heart rate, max heart rate, min heart rate, latitude, longitude
   * notice most of them are blank... and the step count seems oddly repetitive - I don't believe those numbers
   * weirdly these fitness files only go from 9/18/2014 to 11/13/2014, despite me continuing to use Google Fit to this day
* Google Voice voicemails from other folks
   * this was probably shouldn't have surprised me, but it was weird hearing a random voicemail message from my dad playing when I opened an obscurely-titled .mp3 file
* Location history - I included this in the "I knew they had it" section, but really it needed to go down here, and go last. The location history log doesn't _just_ include location history.

[![](assets/366-4.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CXMORJQP2TM/XKF5BAJKmQI/AAAAAAADuDo/d3XGt329eBU8czeeEbGsRJHu-pz%5FVQ5ZQCLcBGAs/s1600/Capture.PNG)

   * timestamp + longitude + latitude, pretty straightforward
   * also, an accuracy indicator, pretty good inclusion
   * also altitude, sure
   * also velocity of travel? heading?
   * also whether I was walking, in a car, on a bike, or staying still
   * ...also that there were 23,869,774 lines in that .json file, corresponding to 2,853,229 data points, going back to 6/29/2012
      * 6/29/2012 was 2465 days before I pulled these data
      * 2853229 data points / 2465 days = 1147.5 data points / day... aka one every 74 seconds (on average) for the past 6 1/2 years.

I didn't sign up for some sort of "special access" pass for Google to look into my life... no more so than most of you, that is. If you have a gmail account. If you use any Google Apps and services (which, you do) they have a similar aggregation available for you. I think it's worth taking a look into. They really don't make it hard.

  
Do I have a problem with them having this much data on me? Well, not really. They provide a great benefit to me in my life, but also the world. They provide services free of charge, in exchange for information about us so they can show relevant advertisements. To me, that's a very worthwhile trade. I wouldn't be nearly as happy or comfortable in my everyday life if Google didn't exist. Neither would you.

  
Also - Google is _hardly_ the only tech company that has a treasure trove of data about each of us, yet (so far as I know) they _are_ the only one that's willing to share what they have with you this easily. I'm sure Facebook and Amazon have an **immense** amount of information about each of us, but they don't give me the same utility that Google does. I pay Amazon for the privileged of using their Prime benefits. Facebook is a great social networking platform for those who want to use it that way... to me it provide negative utility - but that's a different story.

  
So that's Google Takeout. Thus ends my week of obsession with it. Time to move on to other things.  
  
Quick edit: for a quicker look at things - check out <https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity>

  
I'll include this on this post, because I was interested. The data Google sent back to me was sent already broken out into folders by product. Each product may have a different file type from any other product. Prevalent file types were .mp3 for audio, regular .jpg or .png for pictures, calendar and contact files were their standard filetypees, .JSON for most datasets, .CSV was next most popular dataset type, followed by .XML, then niche filetypes (eg. ".MBOX", ".GOO", ".TCX"). Keep notes were kept in an HTML file that looked exactly like the note on the app. Photos were organized in folders by album title, if photos weren't in albums then albums were auto-generated using the date of the day they were taken. My 111,974 files were split into 3,903 folders.

  
Top 5: Services I Recommend YOU Getting an Archive Of

5\. Photos - if you don't actually have your photos on your computer, you're one account loss away from losing all those memories.  
4\. Hangouts - if you used it, it's nice to have a searchable copy of your conversation history for posterity. Also you can do neat analytics if you're not scared of light coding work. I've sent 352,311 messages on Hangouts.  
3\. My Activity > Voice & Audio - just to hear what they have collected  
2\. My Activity > Android - just to see what they have collected  
1\. Location History - this is just good data... and there's a ton of it. You should know that this dataset exists.

Motto: Coincidental Minds Think Alike 

  
If it's been a week since my last update, you can bet one of a few things is probably happening:

1. I'm really busy at work or at home
2. I'm on some sort of sabbatical
3. I have several half-Columns written
4. I'm obsessively thinking about something else
  
In this case, both 3 and 4 are true. I've written half Columns about the following topics:

  
* 2014 in Pictures
* Microsoft's Great Streak of Terrible Design Decisions
* A Post I Had Titled "#Deep"
* Steroids in Competition
* A Post about My Desire for a "Refresh"

This post is a variant of the "Refresh" post. 

  
There's been something on my mind for the past couple of weeks. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on, I couldn't explain. Refresh. Renew. Something should change. I didn't know what. I wasn't "unhappy" by any means, I just felt (careful, here comes a new-agey made up word) under-actualized. I felt like I was growing as a person, and was long overdue for a fresh molt. That's a gross metaphor, but it's appropriate. The shedding an outer layer metaphor works particularly well because my first thought was "I should throw out my wardrobe and buy all new clothes".

  
That's now where I ended up. I _am_ going to do that, to some extent, but it's not where I ended up.

  
Before I _get_ to where I ended up, I need to tell a short story.

  
Melissa went on a cruise with her sister over New Years. This left me with a solid block of time - time that I spent seeing multiple friends, family, and accomplishing quite a bit. When Melissa got back, she was tired, happy, and crazy tan. She sat down with me to look at the contents of the GoPro she took with her. We plugged it into my Linux laptop and proceeded to watch \~20 minutes of the most frustrating video experience imaginable. My computer couldn't keep up. The 60 frames/second video was running at something closer to 6 frames/second on average. Sometimes it was 60, sometimes it was 0, sometimes it jumped massive sections. There was no audio. There wasn't _really_ video. It was good for what we wanted to do - I got to see images of Honduras and Belize, but I didn't get a _video_ experience.

  
So I've decided to refresh my computer.

  
That lead to a nearly week-long identity crisis. No joke there was a period of about a day where I thought the most likely of all outcomes was me buying a Mac, and eventually going full-blown Apple when my phone dies (side note - my phone seems like it's on the verge of hardware failure). I considered building a Linux box. Finally, I decided on building a computer and then doing something I promised myself I would never do again...

  
Putting Windows on it.

  
It gets worse, I won't just be putting _Windows_ on it - but **Windows 8**.1.

  
This is happening. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do somewhat look forward to my transition back to Windows. Linux is awesome, but cumbersome... especially if your Linux machine isn't the computer you spend most of your time on. I'm going back to Windows for the "it just works"-ed-ness, among other reasons (see the Top 5). 

  
I'm excited to build a computer. I've never built one before, and that's just sad.

  
The completely unrelated picture to go out on - here's Molle in people clothes:

Top 5: Things I Will be able to Do with the Coming Computer that I Can't Do Now

5\. Play games. Playstations, Xboxes, who needs em.  
4\. Edit video with confidence again. I've made Lightworks work, but I've never been as comfortable with it as I was Sony's editor.   
3\. WATCH high bitrate video.  
2\. Keep Google Drive in sync with my computer.  
1\. Let someone else use my computer without having to explain, "okay, so here's where the internet is. If you need to do anything else, come get me and I'll help."

Motto: girl scout cookies are a treat, boy scout popcorn is an obligation

  
First, because I never do, here's a short poem:

  
_Running through the forest._  
_Dodging trees like a wild beast._  
_Light on foot._  
_That's where he pooped his pants._  

  
That took me 10+ minutes to write.

  
In my last post I said my next post was going to be a retrospective of 5 years tracking my life. This is not that. I didn't expect to want to write again so quickly.

  
Recently I've been thinking through the real-world logistics of switching to Apple products. My entire adult life I've thought it will happen at some point. I'll wake up one day and throw my Android phone out the window of my new hot red convertible car (implying that it was part of some midlife crisis or something). 

  
It started with a thought exercise with where I tried to map out all of the use cases commonly covered by consumer electronics, rate (from 0 to 5) how well a bunch of different types of electronics enabled you to meet those uses, then try to find some optimal minified subset which adequately covered all the bases I care about.

  
[![](assets/337-1.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1CkIDgEvZow/WtAKUK9NXxI/AAAAAAAC8lI/t55SKeOpO10GpXB%5FcsPzMsZRpzOWQNTjACLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2018-04-12%2Bat%2B8.36.44%2BPM.png)

  
There's that. 

  
The "find an optimal subset" goal didn't really pan out. Instead, I had a couple more interesting takeaways:

  
1\. Apple is the only company which sells products that covering basically every category.

2\. If I could only own ONE piece of technology, I'd pick an iPad.

  
That iPad thought opened my mind a bit. I started noticing and appreciating how well my wife's technology compliments the things she does. She's does thing with her computer that are really cool - things I have no real means to do on my own with my stuff.

  
So then I started thinking - I have an old Android phone. I haven't felt like anything in the past 2 years has been worth upgrading to. I am finding Android development surprisingly tedious. I wonder if iOS development is easier? Most mobile development sites say iOS apps come together quicker and easier. I wouldn't develop on iOS if my daily driver was an Android phone.

  
What if my next phone was the iPhone Xs (or whatever they decide to call it)? 

What if, after my desktop PC craps out, I started using my wife's iMac?

What if my next laptop computer was an iPad with a keyboard case?

  
Let's not get too crazy. 

  
The biggest points of paint would be creating an Apple ID, changing out chargers, redownloading and installing apps, paying for a few that need paying for, and... probably worst of all, redoing the Life Trackers automated fitness imports to whatever.

  
All that said - I stand firm in my belief that most people don't need anything beyond a Chromebook. If you aren't big into music production, complex photo editing, video production, or computer games... there's no real reason to have a Windows/Macintosh machine.

  
Top 5: Vowel Swapped Words That I Can Think Of

5\. Lat, Let, Lit, Lot  
4\. Net, Nit, Not, Nut  
3\. Ban, Ben, Bin, Bun  
2\. Pap, Pep, Pip, Pop, Pup

1\. Bat, Bet, Bit, Bot, But

  
Surely there's one of those that works with every vowel, including "y".

Motto: 2015 was cool.

  
This Column is going to be written over the course of a few days. There's too much going on for me write now. I'm at the Hill house. Avatar is playing on the TV. I forgot that Avatar _is_ actually pretty good. I've been learning how to play 7 Wonders. It's one of the many board games I learned how to play over my holiday vacation (see more about that in the Top 5).

  
Notice I said "my holiday vacation"? That's because my new job actually gives people a vacation at the end of the year rather than saying "you want time to see your family? Use your vacation days, darnit!" I make it a policy not to write about my job on here (for several reasons), but I really like it, so sometimes it's hard not to gush.

  
My favorite fitness-related website has gone through a fairly major re-write. [I wrote about Simple Science Fitness two and a half years ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/76), [it's still worth reading today](http://ss.fitness/). I contacted the author with a question/clarification and he wrote me back within the day answering said question. That's the 3rd time we've interacted directly. I really admire the work he's done.

  
The title of this post is a programming joke. I wish it were "Year++", but sadly I've been stuck writing code in Visual Basic for Applications. It's a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad language. What's cool is that I'm actually experienced enough in writing code to _have_ an opinion about coding languages.

  
Okay - here's the bulk about what I wanted to write about:

  
**It's 2016!**

  
That change doesn't really mean much. It means people look back at their lives over the past year and think about how they want to improve over the next year. It's cliched, but it's what you do. I did that, and this is what I've decided to do.

  
No more 30 Day Challenges. They were my New Year's Resolution two years ago. I was very good about doing them in 2014\. In 2015, I failed more often than not. So, rather than doing 1 challenge a month for a year, in 2016 I am going to be doing 12 challenges _the whole year_. Specifically, I aim to accomplish these twelve things by year's end:

  
1. Weigh 240 lbs
2. Bench 240 lbs
3. Squat 315 lbs
4. Deadlift 345 lbs
5. Incorporate 3 mile runs into my regular workout routine
6. Improve my average macro ratio over previous years
7. Average an 80% success rate for Life Tracking
8. Slowly build savings by spending less
9. Travel out of the contiguous 48 states
10. Read 12 books
11. Trend towards a phone screen-on-time of 1 hour per day
12. No booze\*. No soda. No energy drinks.

\*okay, booze once a month
  
  
Take a look at what I've done over the past 24 months:

  
| Establish great workflow at my new job  | Good.                             |

| Yes Man                                 | Great - but wasn't much different |
| No Reddit or Other Social Sites         | Good - but didn't like it.        |
| Drop Windows, Adopt Linux, Duolingo     | Good                              |
| GoPro Every Day                         | Good                              |
| Enjoy Your Wedding & Honeymoon          | Great                             |
| Run 50 Miles                            | Poor - back problems              |
| Write Every Day                         | Good                              |
| Read 5 Books                            | Fair - reading is hard.           |
| Paleo + Crossfit                        | Great                             |

  
That's a copy/paste from the Life Tracker - which is still awesome, by the way. The top of the table was December 2015 - the bottom, January 2014\. Next year all of my months will have all 12 of my new goals to work toward.

  
Now, for the picture(s) to go out on - a smattering of things from my recent photos list!

  
This is the stack of boardgames we played over the holiday. It does not include Ticket to Ride: Europe, Qwirkle, and the regular playing cards.

Motto: Have You Ever Had a Perfect Day?

  
I had a perfect day. It happened about 3 weeks ago.

  
Melissa and I were married on Saturday the 3rd of May in Lawrence, KS. It was an outdoor ceremony just up the hill from Potter Lake on the University of Kansas. The weather cooperated with the ceremony. It was mostly sunny, in the low 80’s, and not terribly windy. All the best people I've ever met were in attendance. The best person I've ever met was standing right next to me, and that’s what mattered most. The whole ceremony was over in \~24 minutes. It went off (almost) without a hitch. There was one minor incident with a paper lantern that took some coaxing to get lit and flying… but that incident led to what has become an early favorite ceremony photo: 

[![](assets/170-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-smt3mte4%5FsE/U3QkrWY8R0I/AAAAAAABRPo/RNjPcvQxVeQ/s1600/10275943%5F10100270047714018%5F4663312271789908712%5Fn.jpg)

The party bus took longer than we anticipated, the driver didn't exactly take the most direct route available, but that didn't bother me. The hour we spent on that bus was one of the best hours of my life. I had the pleasure and honor of being on both of my sister’s party buses, and they were great each in their own way, but our bus was the most “us” it could have possibly been. The perfect combination of crazy and tame.

  
The reception was amazing. 

  
They say "the best revenge is a life well lived", could the same be said of the best thank you? Is the best thank you appreciating the work that someone has done for you, taking advantage of that work to have the best time of your life? I hope so. I hope just knowing that I had the best day of my life is the best thank you anyone could ever get. If that's not the case, though, let me just say this:

  
Thank you to everyone.

  
The whole day went by so fast. It's a blur - just like I was warned. Luckily, I have some photos from the wedding (and the day before) to help jog my memory.  
  
[Here's an album of pictures taken by family & friends. If you have photos that we don't have, please send them to me somehow! This whole paragraph is a link because this is important.](https://plus.google.com/photos/103862168806820638349/albums/6015336095599784609?authkey=CLrblMfLtsmcvwE)

  
I could keep writing about this, and some day I might pick up where I'm leaving off, but I need to post this. I've got my honeymoon post 2/3rds finished and the post following that completely finished and this one had to come out before them.  
  
I'm working on a video from the day. That will come sometime in the future.

Motto: Otto Octavius was in a skydiving accident. Sadly, he's now an octoplegic.

  
Before I start talking about these things, I'd just like to say that I have not given up the ambition to complete any of the projects I'm talking about in today's Column. 

  
I always have kept a running list of ideas for fun things to do with my down time. Projects for me are what TV is to others. If I don't know how to fill out an evening, you'd probably have a decent-to-good chance of finding me working on any of the things listed in this column.

  
With out further ado, trials, and/or tribulations, I present to you the list of projects not-yet-done:

  
**Videos**

[![](assets/121-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T3zSyoa0dXM/UlHB672wkaI/AAAAAAABAtk/JNII8tgALkU/s1600/Column+121+-+Videomaking.PNG)

  
Rather than talk about each video individually, here's a list of potential synopses:

* "Red-Green Colorblind" - where the person just can't see red or green objects
* "Life Before the Internet" - series of videos falsely remembering life 20 years ago
* "First Ever Photobomb Video" - this one will be a single shot, <10 seconds long
* ... I actually thought I had several more, but this is all I'm seeing

**Movie Poster Project**  

[![](assets/121-2.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5L-ccWHNTeI/UlG4RKj3VQI/AAAAAAABAtI/R6RzFKAGfRs/s1600/First+GIMP+Product,+sadly+took+me+40+minutes.png)

  
Someday I will begin actively making fake movie posters with my friends. The posters would be for generic movies, not direct copies of any pre-existing movie posters. That is to say, we'd put together one for a movie about a duo of spies whose comic misadventures entertain while they still somehow manage to save the day. The focus on production value would be what made the project both funny and worthwhile. I have a list of posters to do, but haven't really started work on any of them.   
  
**Learning to Play Music**  

[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiimcndLFdA/UIdyp_ABAAI/AAAAAAAAxzU/8mZbRKyhwHk/s640/2008_yes_man_041.jpg "YES MAN")](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiimcndLFdA/UIdyp%5FABAAI/AAAAAAAAxzU/8mZbRKyhwHk/s1600/2008%5Fyes%5Fman%5F041.jpg)

  
You could say I've already kind of started this project - but I haven't dedicated nearly the effort into it that I'd like. I want a way to capture and mix my audio. I know myself, and that's how I learn. When that happens, I think you'll see more music-related content on the Column.  
  
**Life Reference**  

[![](assets/121-3.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZX8hPk66HwY/UlHEYgszEKI/AAAAAAABAt4/y733yjh8Tog/s1600/Column+121+-+Life+Referene.PNG)

  
The Life Reference is a single highly-encrypted folder that I will use to consolidate all of those pieces of information you are supposed to keep safe. Banking, insurance, health, and other such things will be aggregated and protected. I'm about half done with this project, but I haven't really done any work on it for a couple months.  
  
**Android Development**  

[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Android_robot.svg "I love this guy")](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Android%5Frobot.svg)

  
I am going to teach myself Android development. I already know how to code a few different languages and have bookmarked several different resources for learning Android development. What I'm waiting for is the Android Studio development suite to come out of testing and into production. After that happens, I have several ideas that I'll toss around before settling down to make something for real. I'm not looking to blow anyone's mind with anything, but it would be cool to have an app installed on my phone that I coded that is actually _useful_ for something (note: a long time ago I made an app that basically just showed a picture of a duck).  
  
**Don't Panic! - The Engineering Binder**  

| [![](assets/121-4.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y1K15WAiMHM/UlGmLwlvPpI/AAAAAAABAsw/ZKS-LmEsVJk/s1600/Column+121+-+Engineering+Binder.PNG) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (if you click on this image you should be able to read the text)                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Engineering binder is a comprehensive review of everything I learned in my engineering classes in college. This is (arguably) the most ambitious project I've ever started. It began in June, 2011; but I haven't really worked on it since I graduated a year ago. I did get 58 very nicely formatted pages down and I still do plan on picking it back up someday. I don't like the idea of having _only_ a diploma to show what I learned in college - I'd rather have _what I learned in college_ show what I learned in college.

Motto: Get really excited.

  
Here it comes.

  
You excited?

  
I turned 27 yesterday. That marks my 27th\* year on this earth, and my 3rd year's Second-A-Day video.

  
Unfortunately, I'd rather watch it in its completion for the first time with my wife... and she's in New York. So there that's not actually going to happen. The video I'm showing instead is my 4th Battlefield Highlights video.

  
HA!
  
  
I will have a watch party for the actual "**My 26th Year**" video with a small group of friends soon.

  
My birthday (and the day after) was full of awesome. Jon came up. We did a lot of awesome stuff. 

* We swam in the pool.
* We played some pool (different kind of pool from the one we swam in).
* We both set PRs on the Deadlift - each of which put us past a new centry mark.
* We played Top Golf with Nick.
* Played Paintball with Nick.
* Won Breakout KC with Krista, Simmons (my friend from work) and the Fullers.
  
I'm going to keep this short and sweet. See the Top 5 for photographic evidence of the aforementioned happenstances.

  
Jon convinced me to give Instagram another try. So this is from my Instagram:

Motto: the word "Pizzazz" has never been played in a game of Scrabble  

  
2016 was an interesting year. That's usually a codeword for "bad", and in this case... it's not. I'm very in-tune with how my life is and how's been... and for **ME**, things are going pretty well. I'm happy. Healthy. Strong. In a good spot in my relationship. In good with friends and family (although there's always room for improvement on those last areas).  
  
Even thought the year isn't over, I'm going to go ahead and do my wrap-up of the "Year of 12 Resolutions", which is what I did instead of 12 individual 30-Day Challenges.   
  
1. Weigh 240 lbs
2. Bench 240 lbs
3. Squat 315 lbs
4. Deadlift 345 lbs
5. Incorporate 3 mile runs into my regular workout routine
6. Improve my average macro ratio over previous years
7. Average an 80% success rate for Life Tracking
8. Slowly build savings by spending less
9. Travel out of the contiguous 48 states
10. Read 12 books
11. Trend towards a phone screen-on-time of 1 hour per day
12. No booze\*. No soda. No energy drinks.
Let's see how I did.  
  
  
[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h0ul_veF6Vw/V1THt3s-VAI/AAAAAAACU-k/TaP8AuET1j8zS1Yd4SoKSL2pGeaX0QE-wCPcB/s640/IMG_7480.JPG)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h0ul%5FveF6Vw/V1THt3s-VAI/AAAAAAACU-k/TaP8AuET1j8zS1Yd4SoKSL2pGeaX0QE-wCPcB/s1600/IMG%5F7480.JPG)

**Weigh 240**  
I started the year off pretty light. Average of the first 5 measurements I took in 2016 is **223.7 lbs**. The average of the last 5 measurements in 2016 (thus far) is **232.3 lbs**. That means I made it about halfway to my goal. But I'm still not fat. So that's good. Believe it or not that's the least "bro" photo I could find for this. Every other one of the several dozen were too embarrassing.  
  
[![](assets/303-1.gif)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ulS6CajrAag/WEyKhjyMZwI/AAAAAAACiJ0/IrUJTGT%5FgicoqEd1C9NrALk4opWEttrGgCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25281%2529.gif)

  
**Bench 240**  
I started the year with the bench max of somewhere around **195 lbs**. This wasn't my "all-time max". I had previously benched 220 back in 2014\. Just 20 minutes ago I went to my HOMEGYM IN THE BASEMENT and set a new PR with **235 lbs**. That's not QUITE to my 240 goal - but I guess I DO have a couple more weeks to get in one more attempt for the full 240.  
  
[![](assets/303-2.gif)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFl-k71xrlM/WEyOzE-I1FI/AAAAAAACiKQ/jviYvcdNd1AqsTfv-drI1L8fMSP9TnOowCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25282%2529.gif)
  
  
**Squat 315**  
I started the year without maxing out on my squats... estimates from the weight/reps I was working out with puts my max likely around **245 lbs**. Almost two months ago I set a new PR in the squat department of **315 lbs**. I actually "squat" 345 - problem was upon review of the video - I didn't get anywhere near parallel. I could probably do 315 legit. I'll give it a shot before January 1st.  
  
[![](assets/303-3.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v9oPpYpb%5FKA/WEyPyAWtEnI/AAAAAAACiKg/ABkBrLHZAowWt8J0-bPXRYZGljnPCiSigCLcB/s1600/2015-03-30.jpg)

  
**Deadlift 345**  
I also didnt' do anything resembling a deadlift max early in 2016\. Estimates put it around **280 lbs** back then. On many occasions since then I have managed to get **315 lbs**. I haven't successfully done a deadlift of more than that. I DID just try and fail for the 345 goal I had set for myself. Couldn't get it off the ground. Which is weird given that I sorta squat that much (even though I give myself zero credit).  
  
[![](assets/303-4.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vFhzkhDNWvk/WEyRZMfc71I/AAAAAAACiKo/E6me8lMlFjos0eync3eG0taR1NlXcaHcACLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG)

  
**Incorporate 3 Miles Runs Into My Workout**  
Yep. Haven't done that yet. Technically I could just run 3 miles one time right before the new year and claim success... assuming I can run 3 miles. I DID start going on bike rides, for what that's worth. I'm still not great at cardio. I DID do a couple 5Ks, though.  
  
[![](assets/303-5.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ti9QE4s%5FTJ0/WEySCEI1rUI/AAAAAAACiKs/rbfLwP8mYR8BTN1x8SoKhFitDfjQ7YufQCLcB/s1600/Captur%2B2e.PNG)

  
**Improve macro ratios**  
Nailed it. Carbs down, protein and fats up. That's the trajectory I was going for. Also I managed to achieve my "average 3000 calories" goal that I added halfway through the year. Christmas time might screw this up for me, though. We'll see.  
  
  
[![](assets/303-6.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/---nFj4AFuLM/WEySqGkipEI/AAAAAAACiKw/moz2-jhjLGUCiuGd-a0RhoIAndnTj9zRwCLcB/s1600/Capt22ure.PNG)

  
**Average 80% success in the Life Tracker**  
Nailed it... so far. I have to not screw this up over the holidays, which is a hard time to keep track of foods and stuff. My average lag time between midnight and "tracking" has gone down by almost 10 hours. This is inside baseball, I am aware.   
  
[![](assets/303-7.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U3Fpu0-Dsao/WE3FYNF6PTI/AAAAAAACiPA/0ZB%5F4hcNJH8yjqFm-Xu6XAMNpyN-lnRcQCLcB/s1600/IMG%5F20160817%5F052622.jpg)

  
**Build up savings**  
I bought a house. There's no such thing as "savings" any more. Okay that's not true, strictly speaking. The intent of this goal for the year was to enable me to buy a house sometime in 2017\. Things worked out better for us to go ahead and jump on the homeowner train. So, I guess I haven't really meet the requirements of this goal to the letter... but I met its design intent?

**Travel out of the contiguous 48 states**  
This picture is from Melissa and my cruise/2 year anniversary vacation. Nailed it.  
  
[![](assets/303-9.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ro4r-1Zr2%5FY/WE3GrGj1veI/AAAAAAACiPM/RHzHYGvRr0sVZOaa6x3PkiZ669AXBcgKgCLcB/s1600/mmm.jpg)

  
**Read 12 Books**  
I read... uhh... 3 books? That's probably 2 more than usual. UTTER FAILURE. I suppose I could read 9 books in the next 21 days. That's totally do-able.  
  
[![](assets/303-10.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KHBkwoNzl60/WE3IGLhXPJI/AAAAAAACiPY/6gbyVZh7X2oHANCob6osiQ4Np6-wp0BCwCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20161124%5F154930.jpg)

  
**Trend screen time towards 1 hour/day**  
Pokemon Go really didn't help with this. Technically I have reduced my average daily screen time by about 20 minutes... but it's still north of 3 HOURS a day. That's embarrassing. Side note - the phone in the picture up there is my original Droid. Back in the day, that was considered a "big" phone. It looks like a toy.  
  
[![](assets/303-11.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QdB7rZhSnr4/WE3IxxeIFBI/AAAAAAACiPg/8MYhv6ce89Aqg8mKMP3SkqEcs8DiN78%5FwCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20161030%5F143141.jpg)

  
**No Booze\*, no soda, no energy drinks**  
This goal was set up with the idea that I would allow myself one day of drinking per month. That quickly became "one day of drinking each variety of banned drinks, which don't need to be consolidated to a single day". I honestly did a good job of that for several months. Then summer hit and the whole thing crashed and burned. I have a Red Bull sitting next to this laptop. There's probably a Nutcracker Ale in the forecast for tonight. I gave it a shot.   
  
Top 5: Surprising Results for the Year  
5\. I came pretty close to getting most of my lifting goals. I considered them "aggressive" back when I established them. I didn't expect to come as close as I have.  
4\. Melissa and I bought a house!  
3\. I accomplished all those lifting goals IN that house!  
2\. I did manage to average 3000 calories/day... but didn't really gain any appreciable weight. My actual average weight over the course of this year has been identical to that of 2015.  
1\. I did genuinely make it like 4 or 5 months on the no booze, no soda thing.

Motto: The Tyrannosaurus Wrecks His Car

  
Despite the title of this post, this Column will not be about a massive, old tortoise.

  
My brother & father-in-law are in [Philmont](http://philmontscoutranch.org/About.aspx) for what I've come to learn is basically the culmination of Boy Scouting. My boss told me that he went there when he was a kid and it is responsible for some of his fondest memories. That's awesome. I am in this spot right between super jealous and not in least bit jealous of them. Philmont is fun, but demanding fun.

  
My wife is gone with my mother-in-law and her siblings to Colorado. They are _also_ doing outdoorsey-type stuff. Melissa said she climbed Red Rock Canyon with a GoPro strapped to her chest earlier today. Typical Melissa, doing things I'm way too much of a wuss to do.  
  
Here's what all that boils down to - I'm alone for the next few days.  
  
Well, except for Thor 2, Loki, and the birds that decided to make a nest in our plant:  
  
  
[![](assets/183-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GTFSfe6w-Ho/U8S8MCJZeNI/AAAAAAABZhk/-W4KRJoKMKc/s1600/IMG%5F20140713%5F115721.jpg)

  
While I'm alone, I've decided to take on a number of personal challenges. Starting several of my medium-term goals. See the Top 5\. It's a large portion of why I wanted to post this. After a self-evaluation, I realized I'm more long-winded than I shoudl be. As a writing exercise, I did this next bit. An overview of my understanding of fitness, in 100 words: **Being fit is worth the effort. Fitness necessitates both a quality diet and consistent exercise. A quality diet prefers natural, nutrient dense foods (meats and vegetables) over processed, calorie dense foods (donuts). Cook your own meals. Don't drink soda. Track your diet. A couple of cheat meals per week is probably okay. Exercise at least three times weekly. You should lift weights, elevate your heart rate, and maintain flexibility. Use free weights, not machines. Do squats, deadlifts, bench, pullups, rows, presses, run, and yoga at a minimum. Doing these things will give you a healthier, happier, and longer life. Kthanksbye.**The last thing I want to talk about is something I've talked about a long time ago (Columns [21](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/07/21-my-last-summers-last-week.html) & [22](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/08/22-its-my-party-and-ill-cry-to-get.html) - my "goal physique". First, it was Daniel Cudmore, whom I saw in the movie "X-Men". Then, it was Matt Grevers, whom I saw in the Olympics. Now, I'd say I'm aiming more for Serge Ibaka, whom I saw on ESPN Magazine's "Body issue".

I made that using GIMP on my new Ubuntu system. It's definitely nothing fancy, but it's the first tangible piece of media I've created... and it's a bunch of shirtless dudes. Maybe I need to reconsider my priorities. **Top 5: Things I'll be Working on this Week**5\. Set up some system automation for importing content into my media server. 4\. Try to understand Android Studio. I tried this for a few hours last night... it's a whole new experience. 3\. Workout. Really hard. 2\. Gun stuff. More on this at a later date. 1\. Learning Lightworks video editor & rebuilding "My 25th Year". I've got less than three weeks until my birthday. I want the video ready to show on August 1st. Even if I was an expert with Lightworks, it would take me a full 6 to 8 hours to put the video together from scratch. I tried setting the first 3 clips up for 2 hours over the weekend. Lightworks functions in a completely different manner than my old editors.

Motto: Let's Get the Naming Scheme Right

  
On Saturday Melissa and I had one of those crazy productive days. The kind of day that you only have once every 2 months. The kind where you sit back at the end of the day and think "man, if I just did this once a week - I'd be so ahead of everything in life". On Saturday we: Drove around the area we'd like to live next year looking at neighborhoods and houses in our potential price range. Went to car dealerships to look at SUVs - we've had "buy a car" on the whiteboard for a couple of months now. Found an SUV we both really liked. Bought it. More on this later. Returned some improperly sized frames to IKEA. Looked around there for a bit. Sunday was pretty darn good too. On Sunday we: Went to an open house, to get an idea of what we'd like for a future home. Checked out a couple of other houses around the neighborhood. Played our last sand volleyball game of the year. Our team only had 3, but we still managed to win. Watched the movie Gone Girl. Thanks to that movie for helping us sleep that night. I filmed our last volleyball game. Here's how it ended: The play in that video does not accurately reflect the entire game... but it was awesome (for me). So - we bought an SUV. For the past year, Melissa and I have been sharing a vehicle. We've known for a while we were interested in getting a second vehicle, one with different physical properties than the small hybrid we already had. With that, we elected to get an SUV. It's bigger. It can haul stuff. It has many uses that the hybrid can't begin to accomplish. Without further ado, allow me to introduce the MK II:

That picture is more about the tree than the car, I admit. It's still cool.  
That is the MK II. I am retroactively renaming the Sonata from "Mark 4" to "MK I". Instead of keeping track of the number of cars I've driven, I'll keep track of the number of cars I've bought. Also, when writing the name I'll use "MK" instead of "Mark". The MK II is nice. It's fancy schmancey. It's got all sorts of bells and whistles. Here's a pictorial review of the vehicles I've driven:

In order - the Weezer Wagon, The Man Car, My Mom's Car, the MK I, and the MK II.

  
Here's the current Gillespie fleet:

Now - the last thing. I found out next year will only have 3 major superhero movies - The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, and the Fantastic Four. Compare that to eight scheduled for 2016, that's not a lot. It made me wonder what the past 15ish years have looked like in terms of major superhero movie releases. So I went to Wikipedia's [List of American Superhero Movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FAmerican%5Fsuperhero%5Ffilms) and copied their list over to Excel. I pulled out several movies that I fundamentally disagree with (I'm sorry - "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" are not superheros), entered their release dates, then wrote a tiny macro:  
  
Sub EasyMac()  
Dim i As Integer Dim j As Integer Dim count As Integer Dim weekNum As Double Dim startNum As Double Dim endNum As Double For i = 1 To 800 j = 0 count = 0 weekNum = Cell(i, 1) For j = 1 To 60 startNum = Sheets(1).Cells(j, 2) endNum = Sheets(1).Cells(j, 3) If weekNum > starnum And weekNum < endNum Then count = count + 1 End If Next j Cell(i, 2) = count Next i  
End Sub  
  
  
I used that to build data a usable format. The result was this chart: 
  
  
The X-axis is date, split into weeks. The Y-axis is the estimated number of different superhero movies you could go watch in major theaters for each week. In making this chart, I assumed that all movies had a 10 week run, which is the best "average length in theaters" I could find.

  
I added a trendline to the data. The formula for the linear fit line is **(9e-5)\*x-2.6037.** That formula represents the average number of superhero movies in theaters over time, starting from January 1st, 1900\. It is very slowly increasing. Extrapolating from the past 15 years, I can estimate that there was no such thing as superhero movies before 3/18/1974\. That's when the average number out crosses zero. The average number of superhero movies in theaters crossed over one on 8/18/2009\. Ever since then, there has been an average of more than one superhero movie in theaters. In January, 2040 the average will raise to 2 movies. In 400 years, you'll need to go to a multiplex with over 14 screens if you want to find something that's not a superhero movie.  
  
Of course, all of that is ridiculous extrapolation - but who doesn't enjoy that?

  
Top 5: Android Lollipop Features I'm Excited About 5\. The reworked notifications/quick settings area. Android's oldest advantage over iOS was its notifications panel. It's getting a fresh look and better functionality. 4\. Smarter lock/unlock features. No need for a pin/passcode if it's connected to my watch. 3\. Project Volta - apparently adding a significant amount of battery life via smarter software. 2\. Material Design. It's so beautiful. 1\. Google Fit. I hope it's the Life Tracker for the masses.

Motto: Hamburgers are Fun on a Bun  
  
File this Column under "Aaron tells other people what they should be doing", which I realize is too common of a theme.  
  
You know what's fun? You know what's rewarding? Honing a skill. Creating something new. Doing a craft. Working on something just because you want to. It's a lot more fun than enjoying someone else's work. It's a lot more _lasting_ fun than enjoying someone else's work.  
  
Creating things brings a sort of whole-brain engagement that only happens with the absolute best of storytelling. I wrote this Life Tracker thing to keep track of all sorts of different aspects of my life so I might be able to read through the data what makes me most happy... what I found out was that what made me most happy was actually BUILDING the thing. Doing the data work. I was more than just coding - I was creating. I was generating a thing that had never existed before and the possibilities were endless. That's really exciting. More exciting than figuring out who killed the person in the first act and how the CSI team solved the case.  
  
I hate those shows.  
  
I loved the show "Making It". It was a short, brisk series that was hosted by two people that seemed like genuine friends. They had a simple message - things made by hand are more meaningful than things that aren't. It was a genuine blast watching the creators in that show take a simple idea & some supplies and turn them into works of art - very _different_ works of art.   
  
Anyway, I'm not advocating changing everything wholesale in life. I think that my most pervasive real-world motto is "keep everything in moderation." Another person might have a different way of phrasing that... I'll give you a hint about the person - he's very crappily drawn right below this text.   
  
Top 5: Favorite Stuff I've Made  
5\. This Thanos drawing - my best digital work work for now  

[![](assets/352-1.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i46eL-v%5FwK8/W6W4iBgmwLI/AAAAAAADeO4/gKjfMO0wjzQmllgRYD41ZNorPp-BYBW%5FwCLcBGAs/s1600/sketch1526697110311.png)

  
4\. This drawing - not my best pencil & paper drawing, but my favorite  

[![](assets/352-2.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zjHyth6f5sI/W6W2H8KI4GI/AAAAAAADeOo/e8CdXZ1UW4g8eqdR2bxUEe%5F-s6PFDmGHQCLcBGAs/s1600/%2523353%2B-%2BDrawing%2BOne.jpg)

  
3\. This shield - made from a sled  

[![](assets/352-3.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fsfiXiTfNGo/W6XOnyO%5FAII/AAAAAAADePQ/0zhlHLE9cB8FuzDJ7Yi7vCWV2J0lyDAUgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20161029%5F124131.jpg)

  
2\. This desk modification - I also added a drawer to the other side.  

[![](assets/352-4.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DHdL2ctXRhA/W6XQo-98liI/AAAAAAADePk/W2oqcErgzxcsFEGpOEQVfLCLQ1ZGoplZgCLcBGAs/s1600/%2523352%2B-%2BDesk.jpg)

  
1\. The Life Tracker is pretty cool. So is The Column. The [Second-A-Day Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8%5FAwZQKjplc&list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw) are neat. You know, the stuff I've been doing consistently for years.

Motto: It Makes a Fool of Us All  
  
Life seems to me like a series of choices about what to do with your resources. Mostly those resources fall into energy, time, and money.  
  
It used to be that I'd sit down to write most Columns not knowing what I wanted to write about. The net result would be whatever came to my mind between the time I sat down and the time I stood up. Nowadays I know essentially exactly what I want to say before I ever approach my computer. I write more Columns in my head than I ever get to put online - I just "don't have the time" to do it.  
  
I have been saying for years that the "having no time" excuse is mostly bologna that old people say to make up for not using their time wisely. While I still think that's true to some extent, my tune has changed.  
  
Actually. After doing an exercise to fill out this paragraph with, it looks a lot like this is still the case and I've just been woefully misusing my time. Maybe I should do another time study like I did for ten weeks back in 2012.  
  
[![](assets/342-1.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jLGvP0Ex%5Fns/WynAMzgFU0I/AAAAAAADFwE/O%5FNMT75gEEs6jpx0BeMfl-UF2Ln9Vsh0gCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2018-06-19%2Bat%2B9.46.04%2BPM.png)

  
Yeah I've been doing this "let's make spreadsheets about life" sort of thing for a **long** time.   
  
I haven't made time in the past few months to play videogames with any regularity. The E3 Expo was last week, and it made me realize I hadn't played any videogames in over a month. Historically I've considered myself a video game guy. I listen to podcasts about them. I've played them my whole life, as a social experience or a solo one. Is that going away? I don't know. I doubt it.  
  
I have played about 6 games of Fortnite now. It's alright. Really good for being free, yet they're making money arm over fist somehow. How about that. Also I looked pretty heavily at [Super Smash Bros Ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHRwMmwbFnA) on the Switch in time for Christmas, and the upcoming [Hitman 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8aRCwbZGek) (Hitman 2... 2?).  
  
  
[![](assets/342-2.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LCzGY4spvEY/WyaBmcrG4QI/AAAAAAADFkY/PER3-84YQh8JKuAncL90PZzn2cutL-7vQCLcBGAs/s1600/ink%2B%252813%2529.png)

  
Economics is the study of limited resources. In a weird way I'm into economics.  
  
This was rambly and unfocused JUST LIKE I LIKE IT. Been tacking on additional sentences and paragraphs for a few days. I need to rewrite about time, energy, and money in a more focused way sometime. Especially on the energy part. Energy is something I think a LOT about and don't talk about as much.  
  
Last thing I'll touch on before I go - I've been doing a "No Zero" thing this year. That's been somewhat successful.   
I've been doing a detox thing for the past two months that's been probably equally successful.   
And I have trimmed the Life Tracker down to something I'll be using more long-term (cause 5 years wasn't long-term).  
Maybe I should have written about all those things instead.  
  
Top 5: Columns I've Written, but Only in My Head  
5\. Getting older. A followup to the "Aaron just turned 25" post from nearly 5 years ago. A less optimistic one.   
4\. An extensive review of Timbuk2's Never Check Expandable Backpack and why I'm interested in backpacks all.  
3\. An update on the stuff I use to do stuff, day-to-day, with a focus on the tech gadgetry and services I use. I [wrote 3 years ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/258) a Top 5 about wanting a perfect Google laptop, I got that hypothetical laptop a year ago. It still blows me away each time I use it.  
2\. A story, a comic, or a cartoon telling the story of a young couple walking away from their village into the forest in search of what's next.  
1\. Melissa and I are going to have a baby boy. Even attempting to address this fact, to write about it to give it any sort of justice sounds impossibly daunting. It could be an entire blog of its own. I'm going to be a dad... pretty soon, too.

Motto: Apple iWatch Air S C Plus

  
Apple's iPhone 6/iWatch announcement happened yesterday. Here's a 10 point overview: 1\. There are two new iPhones, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus. 2\. The iPhone 6 is 4.7", the 6 plus is 5.5". 3\. Apple is FINALLY trying to replace the wallet with "Apple Pay". 4\. Apple Pay uses NFC, something the iPhone has been lacking for years. 5\. Apple announced the Apple Watch... it's not the "iWatch". 6\. Apple Watch uses a rounded square form factor, with a squared screen. 7\. The watch uses several input interfaces - a button, a dial/button, and a dual-mode touch screen. 8\. The watch will also come in two sizes. 9\. The watch will have tons of straps to choose from - a surprising amount of focus was spent on the straps. 10\. The watch will sell for $349 (or more) and won't be available until 2015\. Here are my thoughts, I'll keep this short: The iPhone 6 I think 4.7" is really a sweet spot in terms of screen size. I bet this is the better selling model. This is probably the most enticed I've ever felt by an iPhone. The iPhone 6 Plus It's amazing to me that Apple is putting out of Phablet. This phoen is being positioned as the "superior" model. It's got one or two small improvements over the smaller version and it sells for $100 more at all levels. The Apple Watch This thing is... well... it's interesting. A device that small requires its own interface - on all levels. Apple took that challenge and really went in a different direction than anyone expected. It's got a touch screen. Sweet. It's got a touch screen that can also differentiate between a touch and a press. Oh, okay. Like the Blackberry Torch? That's cool I guess. It's got a wheel on it like a standard watch. Oh, that makes sense. It's also got this \*\*\*other button that has a special, single purpose. The touch screen plus any ONE of those secondary interfaces I would have believed... but all three? That's interesting. The \*\*\*software User Interface is also interesting, but I'll get into that more later (Top 5). Apple Pay The iPhone has integrated near-field communication FINALLY. If this push doesn't make NFC-based Mobile Phone payments more mainstream, then nothing will. I absolutely cannot wait for the day when I can leave my wallet at home. I won't be using Apple Pay, but I'll be using the infrastructure and experience that Apple Pay will help usher in. Thank you, Apple. Better late than never. The new screen sizes and resolutions will make life more difficult for developers, but it's a necessary problem. That's the price they pay for a not-very-forward-thinking model. I'm glad to see they finally decided to go to a standard 1080p resolution (on the 5.5 inch one). That's my summary. My shorter summary on everything Apple announced is this: Overall I was not overwhelmed, nor was I underwhelmed... I was just "whelmed". I just realized that basically all of Apple's product lineup comes in two sizes now. There's a smaller and larger version of the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, and iMac. Huh. My Moto 360 came in the mail today. I'd write more about it, but it's lateish and I wrote the vast majority of this post yesterday.

  
Top 5: Surprisingly Fundamental Questions about the Apple Watch that have Yet to be Answered 5\. When you raise your wrist and the watch screen turns on, does it show the clock face, the App Grid, or something else? 4\. Can the button (not the dial) on the side of the watch be used for anything other than calling up your contacts list? If they made a dedicated hardware button to perform a single software function... that's a very surprising design decision. 3\. How much of an Apple user's interaction with his devices is supposed to be done with the watch? I mean, what are they aiming for? 2\. How exactly are those apps arranged on that grid? I heard them say you can customize it, but how? Also, it's like a strange star pattern... what's up with that? 1\. How long is the battery \*\*\*actually going to last?

Motto: Clean your weight, deary

  
This post isn't a feature. It's mostly a story. It's a nerdy story about triumph. But first... I've made no secret of the fact that I'm an [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/231/) fan. I recently re-stumbled across one of my old favorite comics. Back in the day, I thought this was funny because it is true. Now, I think it's just awful because it's true.   

[![](assets/193-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LHYDQPUXj2M/U-6CkJqj4DI/AAAAAAABbWs/jjZdcx2glHE/s1600/%23193%2B-%2Bcat%5Fproximity.png)

I'm an idiot 80% of the time I'm at home now. Thanks Thor and Loki. Story time. I have a on-again-off-again history with writing code. import english.words; I majored in Computer Science in college for a few months before switching to Electrical Engineering. In 2008 I got a "B" in my first coding class, but the complexity of my 2nd coding class caused me to panic, drop the course, and switch majors. That was the only course I ever dropped. If I had stuck with it I would have seen that, according to my friends who DID stick with it, "that was the hardest class I ever had to take". Apparently that was what my dad called a "weed out" class. The assignment that killed me was "write a program that solves Sudoku puzzles". They had us do this before teaching us how to effectively use a debugger. Instead of doing that, I switched majors. I stopped writing code. for(int i; i < 2; i++){ years = years + 1; } May, 2010, I had a summer job interning for the first time. I made friends with a few guys who knew VBA (Visual Basic for Applications, another coding language). Thanks to them, I saw how useful coding could be and learned Visual Basic. I figured out how to use a debugger. I learned that writing code didn't have to be a "it either all works or it all doesn't" type of experience. I decided I had to exercise my coding demons, and I wrote a program in Microsoft Excel that solves Sudoku puzzles. Over the next 2 months I wrote it. It worked. It can solve any puzzle you give it. It's better at Sudoku than I am. There was a huge celebration (in my head). The next summer, I wrote a maze solver (with caveats) in Excel and one or two other little things. int j = 0; while(j < 2){ years += 1; //again j++; } April, 2013, as I prepare to fly to Thailand to propose to my now wife, I had an idea for a project: a Google Spreadsheet that would keep track of all the things in my life that I was letting get out of hand. To do it, though, I would need to learn how to code for Google Spreadsheets. Over the next month or so, I learned Javascript. I built out a program that I've used for the past year to keep track of my life, adding to it along the way (just updated a part of it last night, actually). This is (so far) the only coding I've ever done that's done anything whose use goes beyond novelty status. int x = 0; int newYear = 0; do{ newYear = years+1; years = newYear;} while(years < 2014); This year I decided to do the thing that's so obvious, such an easy logical jump, such a stupidly simply next thing to do that half a dozen or more people have told me "you should do this". You love Google. You love Android in particular. You have some experience writing code. Why don't you write an app, dummy? I enrolled in the Android Application Development class by Google on Udacity. I'm not taking it for credit, or anything, just to learn. The first thing I learned is that I am TERRIBLE at (class and) object-oriented programming. I have been writing in Javascript for a year, I figured the jump to Java would be easy. It's a whole different beast. I did all my work on the Life Tracker working within a single class. I had no idea what "extends" meant. I had no real understanding of the notion of "private" and "public" methods and variables. What's a constructor? Where is the code actually _running_??? Sadly, I was unable to complete the Android Application Development class. They expected \~2 years of Java background and I went in with 1 year of Java_script_. So I enrolled in a 4 month "Intro to Java" course. Here's the thing, though. It's got 9 lessons and it's supposed to take 4 months... but I'm already on lesson 6 and it's been less than a week. I'm flying through the course. It's 90% review for me, but review in a new language. Is it worthwhile? Absolutely. I'm confident that I'll be able to pick up where I left off in the Android course and run with the football. That's my story. That's the Column.

  
Top 5: My Favorite Lifts

5\. Sumo deadlifts - like deadlifts, but better for tall people. 4\. Bench press - required answer for everyone. 3\. Pullups 2\. Tricep extensions - admitted guilty pleasure. 1\. Clean & Press - they say squats are the king of all exercises, and it's true. But I prefer the clean and press. No other exercise I've found works the whole body as effectively. Also, Cleans are fun, squats are not fun. That's all there is to it.

Motto: Balance in the Force  
  
This post will serve as the _"yong"_ to the previous post's "ying".   
  
First I'll start by saying I'm _back_ on prescription anti-inflammatories and honestly and truly back to feeling normal. Do you have any idea how **good** it feels to feel "normal"? It feels damn amazing. I think I'll take the stairs. I think I'll clean the house. I think I'll tackle that project. I think I'm going to go lift weights.  
  
\#BACKtoHealth was a last-minute success. My 30 Day Challenge for May will be for me to watch 10 movies from my "Movie Bucket List".  
Wednesday was the three year anniversary of the day on which I married Melissa. It was the three year anniversary of the best day of my life. It was the 1096th day in my streak of good days (on the whole). It was the 36th straight month in which I was able to fill out "married" on hospital forms, rather than having to choose the single option and tell the hospital staff "it's complicated!". It marked the denotation of the 3rd complete trip around the sun Melissa and I have made as a legally wed couple. It was the 9,500,000th second I've lived without regretting a second.  
  
We chose to celebrate the occasion with literally the fanciest meal I've ever had. We continued celebrations by spending more time together... which has lasted from then until now. Melissa's going into the summer, so I get a feeling we'll be able to continue celebrations for a good long while.   
  
As it so happens, each year at around the same time as Melissa and I celebrate our anniversary, Marvel put out a blockbuster movie. This year's edition was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2\. Man it was fantastic. GotGV2 dethrones the first one (or, possibly, "Ant Man") as the funniest entry into the MCU... and it did so without sacrificing quality, story, or heart. It was another huge win for Marvel, and another time I was not let down after having my expectations built up for a long time. If you haven't seen it yet - go see it. Everyone in the world should like this movie. It's just good fun.  
  
Speaking of good fun - I played pool against some new folks the other day. It was a social event with people I had never really spent any amount of time with that I instigated. That's never happened before. It was a good time. We got to know each other just a bit while we played. Generally it worked out pretty alright! Also I got to ask about how pool leagues work and learn some stuff I'd never be able to teach myself on the table in my parents' basement.  
  
The last thing I'm going to write about in this post that is 100% "this is what I've done recently" is the Royals game I went to on Friday. Or maybe I should say the Royals game I _didn't_ go to on Friday.   
  
Melissa and I went to a social work gathering at Kaufmann Stadium. We started the evening off with some tailgating, presumably to be followed by us using our tickets to sit in a chair and watch some baseball surrounded by my coworkers. What transpired instead, though, was us deciding "we're having a great time and don't really care to see opening pitch". "We're having a great time and don't really need to see any of the first inning". "We're having a great time and don't really need to see any of the first 4 innings". "Oh hey they're playing fireworks, I guess the game is over and we never went in to watch".  
  
I gotta say, I couldn't be happier about it. I got to spend a very quality evening with a group of people that I have the good fortune to work with. A work group so great that I'd rather hang out with them in a parking lot than go watch baseball. Or, to say more, I'd rather hang out with them in a parking lot than hang out by myself at my house. It was a night full of laughter, dancing to almost no music, and healthy tailgate gaming competition. We all won.  
  
I've had a phenomenal week. There's more to come - Melissa and I have a friend lunch to go to in a few hours. Then a full Sunday's worth of whatever you do when your house is already clean and you've got some spare time on your hands.   
  
LIFE IS GOOD.

Motto: In Two Weeks, Someone Will Make a New Year's Resolution Joke with the Punchline "1920x1080"

  
I wrote one post in the past month. If you asked why that is, I honestly wouldn't know what to tell you. I moved the Column down my priority list.

  
What I DID do instead?  
  
Made this, for one:  
  
  
That video took forever to put together. Worth it.

  
I've done several other things:

  
Saw family.

Saw friends.

Shopped for Christmas stuff.

Watched a couple of movies.

Started rewatching a couple of old TV favorites.

Played Battlefield.

Worked.

Worked out, like 3 times.

  
I kept busy.

  
I might go back to updating this every once in a while I suppose.

'Tis in a Motto: Ottoman I Sit

  
Writing with constraints is a fun and difficult task. It will push you to go to spots to which you would not normally go. Crafting thoughts around a constraint is hard - I just said that. But as a smart man has said - if a thing isn't hard to do, is it worth doing? Having us both said our own things - it's also worth stating that not all difficult things warrant doing. You don't do your cooking with no lights on, do you? Baking in pitch black is not good for anything. It's difficult, but has no obvious point, no justification. Why do it? For art? Up until this point, this column has had a constraint. It's an illustration of a lipogram. That will now End. From Wikipedia: "_**Constrained writing** is a [literary technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary%5Ftechnique "Literary technique") in which the writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern.[\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained%5Fwriting#cite%5Fnote-SS1-1)_" I usually don't consider something to be "poetry" unless it conforms to some sort of constraint; be that rhyme, meter, or something else. If you can work some sort of constraint into your writing without sounding at all unnatural, it's a beautiful thing. It's art.

  
Writing with constraints is a mental exercise. Like other exercises, it makes you stronger. It also lets you really appreciate the creations others have made. Demetri Martin once wrote [a 224 word palindrome](http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/panorama/Literature/Martin/MartinPalindrome.html). Randall Munroe published [a comic explaining the parts of the Saturn V rocket](http://xkcd.com/1133/) using only the 1000 words people use most often (he said 10 hundred words, because "thousand" isn't one of the 1000 most often used words). Demetri Martin _also_ wrote [a poem by rearranging the all the words on a bottle of Rolling Rock](http://poetry-fromthehart.blogspot.com/2011/07/all-of-words-on-bottle-of-rolling-rock.html) beer. That "[Buffalo buffalo buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo%5Fbuffalo%5FBuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5FBuffalo%5Fbuffalo)" thing is the most constrained writing I've ever seen. **\- Palindromes -**  I've written a few palindromes in my day. The motto is a palindrome. This paragraph contains none, so don't waste your time looking for them. I generally don't enjoy writing palindromes, because you usually have to settle for something that's awkward to read or something that makes little sense. It's hard to sneak a palindrome in to regular conversation. Fun fact: The word "palindrome" is ridiculously hard to build a palindrome around. People on the internet couldn't do it. Nor Aaron. **\- Alliterations -** Starting every word with the same letter sucks. It's hard to do and even harder to read. Again, you can't usually sneak an alliteration into everyday-type speaking. Alliterations are always annoying. Aaron's alliterations are arguably amicable... also aggravating, agitating, and alarmingly addictive. **\- Rhymes -** Rhyme (usually combined with meter) is your standard poetic constraint. Nearly everyone has written a "roses are red, violets are blue" monstrosity at some point. I don't prefer simple rhymes. I like rhymes that happen across multiple syllables across multiple words, perhaps even across the sentence. Rhyming is a cinch. Stopping is unnecessary. Timing in a pinch. Dropping unless you carry. Didn't make sense, but it rhymed across syllables, across words, and across the sentences. Good enough. **\- Meter -** Meter refers to the number of syllables in a given line. This is a more effective way of measuring the "length" of a sentence, when compared to counting the number of words. Syllables are more basic than words. You can count on them.

  
A famous illustration of meter: Haikus 

  
Haikus are poems that are only built with a specific meter, 5-7-5\. Haikus can be fun, but they don't always make sense. Refrigerator. **\- Anagrams -** Dan Brown featured anagrams heavily in "the Da Vinci Code". A long, vivid sentence can be hard, and I'm a wiry, deaf author. 

  
I like doing anagrams, but usually only if they are a couple words long. If you get too many letters it's hard to keep track of things. That's a detriment to the writer and the reader, in my experience. "Aaron Gillespie" says "Original, please". **\- Pilish -** Now I have a crazy challenge. Pi digits guide the words' duration. Difficult keeping direction. But if you organize your vision, it should come out.

  
Pilish is a good constraint for me in particular because I have Pi memorized out to 27 digits because high school wasn't sufficiently challenging.

  
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884 **\- Acrostics -** Acrostics Are Really Obscurely Named. It's Simple, Conceptually - Only Opening Letters. 

  
Acrostics are when first letter of each word/sentence/paragraph forms a word or sentence. I did this a few columns back. [I wrote an initialism using the word "initialism"](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/03/156-showered-and-writing.html).

Top 5: Constrained Writing Projects I've Done

5\. This Column has contained several. Collectively they warrant inclusion on this list. 4\. A nonsensical poem written using English words which makes sense when you move around the spaces. Simple, bad example: "Willy O, U, Significant?" becomes "Will you sign if I can't?" 3\. A short story written only using song titles. Simple example: "[Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZcqBgCS74). [Hello, I love you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzM71scYw0M). [Hello goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBZ8ulc5NTg)." 2\. I broke my right arm in 2001 & had to wear a cast for a couple months. During that time, every time I wrote anything it was done in a highly constrained manner. Technically accurate is the best kind of accurate.1\. The short story I wrote using homophones, homonyms, & antonyms. If you're interested in reading it, just keep swimming.  
  
Don't be an Oxymoron:   
  
“I drove to a park the other day. There I met a new old man and had this conversation. It started when I told him life seemed deathly hard - it's simply too difficult.  
  
He said _'You should think a little bigger. You aren't failing to succeed, you are working to success through failure. It's alright to be all wrong; because once you're failures pass, you'll find what's left is what's right.'_  
  
What he was saying sounded awfully good.  
  
_'Let me tell you a true story - originally, I copied others. I had been a minority for the majority of my life. Next, I became stuck in the same quest to be different. It was pretty ugly. My attempts were really fake; and it seemed like everyone hated me. I was even at odds with myself'_  
  
He paused to watch some kids play - he only stopped to continue.  
  
_'Now then, the past is a present. The new days, they're here. You're forgetting to remember your victories. You need to remember to forget your defeats. They are old news - stop going there. Consider yourself fortunately unfortunate. You've had to push yourself to pull through. Don't accept a decline in your life. Keep changing! You can't fill a tall glass in short order. With effort, things will come a bit easier. Once you get afoot, you will get ahead. Your failures will increasingly decrease; and as things will come to pass, you'll have found you never really lost."_  
  
  
As he started to finish, I thought about us. We sat there together, alone with our conversation. I looked dumbly at the wise old man.  
  
What he said seemed quite possibly impossible. I mean, he was nice; but I was certainly uncertain about what he was saying.  
  
I clearly misunderstood.  
  
Good grief."

Motto: I'm the Guy in the Suit

  
This post was written more for me than usual. Proceed with caution and/or boredom.  
  
Most of my writing lately has funneled into the MCU Feature. I didn't make that a link, because what's on this site doesn't reflect the current state of the Feature. I don't like Blogger's text editor for advanced formatting. I want my Features to be formatted nicely, sort of a showcase of "I _could_ be doing _this_ every time". So I'm writing the Feature elsewhere, and will hopefully figure out a way to display it on this site that maintains my formatting.  
  
Hopefully.  
  
It's October. [Traditionally, October has been my bulk month](http://www.aarongilly.com/215l), but I am taking bulk off this year for a couple of reasons:  
  
1. I don't have access to a gym with a proper squat rack or bench press. Bulking without lifting heavy is just called "getting fat". So I'm not doing that.
2. I am in two basketball leagues, playing at least two games a week. It's come to my attention that I could use some cardio love. Bulking runs counter to that end.

The 30 Day Challenge for this month will instead be "**break a sweat 5 days a week**". That should be nice and easy without being _too_ nice and easy. I very badly need to get back on top of my health game. So this covers that.  
  
In my writing of the MCU Feature, I've been rewatching the series. I still pull out new things from these movies... not saying they are super deep or anything - I'm just saying that almost every movie usually has a few things you can't pick up without repeated viewings. I've fully changed my opinion about a few details from these movies because I've picked up new things this time around.  
  
I babysit my niece and nephew. Kids are getting less scary... but that brings them from "the scariest thing I can think of" levels to "less scary than 'The Ring', but still way up there" levels.  
  
Proof I have the best friends:

Top 5: Things that Happened in 2008

5\. Christopher Nolan's "[The Dark Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FDark%5FKnight%5F%28film%29)" comes out. It blows away everyone's expectations, but doesn't earn the top-scoring "superhero movie" spot on this list.  
4\. I switched majors from Film Studies to (journalism, then computer science, then computer engineering, then...) Electrical Engineering  
3\. HTC came out with the ["HTC Dream"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC%5FDream), the first ever Android device  
2\. Marvel came out with [Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%5FCinematic%5FUniverse), marking the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  
1\. The University of Kansas won the [Orange Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%5FOrange%5FBowl) (football) and the [National Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%5FNCAA%5FMen%27s%5FDivision%5FI%5FBasketball%5FTournament) (men's basketball)

Motto: Discipline Beats Motivation  
  
Lately I have had trouble doing new Aaron things.  
  
The ideas haven't gone. It's the follow through. I sought to remedy this situation by nixing passive entertainment from my life in October. That worked until it didn't. _I set goals, do a great job with them at first, but after a bit I'm back to baseline Aaron. The goal is present, but the change in behavior is not._  
  
Comfort is the problem.  
Control is the answer.  
Captain America.  
  
...or maybe that's just what I think.  
  
I wonder if it I could play a Clair De Lune on the piano in a month?  
I wonder what it would be like to stop drinking caffeine & alcohol entirely?  
I wonder what it's like to eat an IIFYM diet?  
I wonder if I could make my own shirt from a sheet of fabric?  
I wonder if I could design and construct my own pergola?  
I wonder what I should do to continue my education?  
I wonder if I could have an Android app in the Play Store before the end of the year?  
I wonder what it would be like if I used lotion on one half of my body every day for a few months, would it be noticeably different from the other after I stop?  
  
These thoughts have felt like strictly hypothetical impossibilities. "Ah man I wish I could just do this" when there's literally no reason I couldn't other than it would mean I'd have to change behavior. I'd have to follow through. I'm throwing the ball at the rim right now.  
  
I used to have so much less to do, and I feel like I got more done. It's most likely that's the benefit afforded to you by the distance between the present and the past.  
  
  
Or maybe I've been too hard on myself.  
  
I've had basically the same set of goals for the longest time... and maybe the problem lately is that I've achieved most of them. Or I've achieved them to a level that I'm not willing to surpass. I could murder myself in the gym and get to my goal strength... but that wouldn't be worth it. As someone with an MBA would say: The ROI isn't there, opportunity costs are high. Invest elsewhere.  
  
Maybe it's time to change my goals. Think bigger. Think different. Or maybe just think less. Maybe I should just live a non-goal-oriented life for a while.  
  
Nah, doubt that.  
  
The things that are right and true when you're thinking with your best, most well-rested brain are also right and true on the days where you're not. I feel like that's important to know... but I thought of it when I was grooving on a caffeine buzz, so it won't be true when I'm bummed out or sleepy or hungry.  
  
I'll just have to keep seeing the glass half full - also split in half vertically:

5\. MacGruber

Motto: Step 1 - wake up

  
Have you ever been in a mood for an extended period of time? I'm talking like _days_ here. I have been lately.

  
Melissa is walking around dressed up like Bruno Mars right now.

  
Google announced the "Chromebit" earlier this week. It's basically an HDMI dongle that turns whatever TV you want into a Chrome OS computer. The device itself looks like this:

  
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zLdwDCew4w/VR4HUEXW6rI/AAAAAAABq6Y/2CRSXoquUWU/s1600/%23236%2B-%2BChromebit.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zLdwDCew4w/VR4HUEXW6rI/AAAAAAABq6Y/2CRSXoquUWU/s1600/%23236%2B-%2BChromebit.png)

  
The tech blogs are not covering this in much detail. When they _do_ talk about it, they generally talk about Google flooding the market with "devices for your TV". It is confusing, though. Should my TV have a Chromecast, an Android TV box, or a Chromebit plugged in to it? 

  
Regardless of that question, I think this thing is just a really cool idea. Hulu Plus on Chromecast was giving me some trouble the other day, so I plugged my Chromebook into my TV and set it out of sight. At that point what I had was essentially what this thing will be... and it was pretty cool!

  
That's just my $0.02.

  
Speaking of Chrome - the new Chromebook Pixel looks so darn good. I wish I could justify spending $1000 on a new laptop. I'm really looking forward to the proliferation of the new USB Type-C standard as found on the new [Chromebook Pixel](http://v/) and Apple [Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/).

  
Melissa is doing something for school involving a dance to "Uptown Funk". That's why she's dressed up like Bruno Mars. She's been dancing to the song on repeat since I started writing this. All to entertain her kids at school. She would be a good teacher. She's awesome to live with.

  
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iblkvxaw3VU/VR4KfGg9SrI/AAAAAAABq7I/ydOsekq_wn8/s1600/IMG_20150402_221933.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iblkvxaw3VU/VR4KfGg9SrI/AAAAAAABq7I/ydOsekq%5Fwn8/s1600/IMG%5F20150402%5F221933.jpg)

  
I mean, how can you not love that?

  
Alright, so last month's 30 Day Challenge wasn't formally defined at any point. I decided that last month's move was pretty challenging, so I'm retroactively calling March the month of the Move Challenge.

  
**April's 30 Day Challenge:**

  
**Work out before work. Take lunch to work.**

  
I spent a semester at college working out first thing in the morning before an 8AM class. That single change begat several other noticeable changes... moreso probably than any of the 30 Day Challenges I've taken on during the past year change. Discipline is a good thing.  
  
This morning I walked to the gym at our new place to exercise. During my 4 minute on-foot commute I walked by a garage door that was open. Inside it were 3 hardcore looking dudes doing squats in a power rack next to a Harley Davidson. I've never felt so immediately and instantly uncool by comparison.   
  
Speaking of uncool - I tagged this post with the tag "nerdcred". If I haven't already justified that tag, let me clear up any doubt right now:  
  
Dominion is getting its 9th expansion. This expansion was never _supposed_ to happen (but always posited as "a possibility"), thus my [storage solution](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/01/132-30-day-challenges-dominion-box-and.html) is no longer going to work. Regardless of whether or not it was expected, I'm excited for its rapidly approaching release. The first time I ever played the game I was hooked. I thought the possibilities for building interesting mechanics within the framework of the game were endless. After 8 very different expansions, it turned out I was about right. Each introduced some new concept or idea into the game... and almost all of them worked _really_ well. I hadn't thought much about the game in the past couple of months, largely because I felt as though the space within the game available to explore was beginning to show its limitations. The 9th and soon-to-be released expansion seems to include not _one_ new concept, but several. It's looking like a _great_ addition that will add months of replayability to the already ridiculously replayable game. 

  
Top 5: Things I'm Looking Forward to in the Next Month or So

5\. 4/6 - The Dominion promo cards I ordered come in  
4\. 4/10 - "Daredevil" on Netflix  
3\. 4/18 - Dominion: Adventures  
2\. 5/1 - The Avengers: Age of Ultron  
1\. 5/3 - Melissa and my 1-year anniversary, the only non-nerdy thing on this list

I said I was interested in changing up The Column. This is me doing that. For future reference, this is the first post I'm writing after my move from Blogger to a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll-based personal blog using a barely-modified [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. 

The new & improved Column is mostly for my own benefit. I'm excited to be able to write posts using **markdown**, which has been my flavor of the month for the past two or three months running. If you don't know what it is, don't worry about it. Mostly it makes *quite* excited to write more.

## The Implications

The format of all future posts may look more like this and less like posts #2 thru #375. Internal links to previous posts will (probably) stop working - and the formatting from those old posts may or may not look like garbage, I'm not too worried about it. I plan on keeping my **Top 5** and **Quotes** sections, so not much is changing. At least not on that front. You're going to probably start seeing a lot more structure in each given post, though. Section headings are a big reason I like Markdown & will be more prevalent. Also more prevalent: typos! At least if I write using my laptop.

Soon I'll figure out how to do internal links to section headers & include a table of contents with each Column.

## Recap of Personal Projects Currently in Flight

I've been doing a *lot* of stuff lately. In addition to the long-running "Life Tracker" and "30 Day Challenge" projects, I've decided recently to:

* Move the Column of Blogger (**done** as of today!)
* Revamp (and rename) the Life Tracker
	* This one alone could be enough to take up all of my time for a few months, I'm aiming much higher
* Learn how to do my new*(ish)* role at work
* Learn Python
	* I actually used Python the other day to accomplish something relating to this Blog - it was *super* gratifying
* Start to make additions to the house - we've lived here for a few years and haven't really *improved* it in any meaningful way
* Writing articles for my knowledge center ["Gillespedia"](http://gillespedia.com), which is a much worse-looking website than this (frankly they just exist in my Notion right now)
* Recording [Podcasts](http://wesceneamovie.com) with my buddies Richard & Guy 1
* Change up my workout routine (**done** a while back, but I've committed to continually changing it every 8 weeks, so now that's an on-going thing)
* Reduce, reuse, recycle - I've got more interest in taking up habits to minimize my impact on the environment
	* I'll write more about this eventually, it's another one of those unsexy solutions situations I wrote about in [Post #291](http://aarongilly.com/291-crackers-update-clarity-chromeos/)

I don't know what I'd do if I weren't doing stuff like this. Probably just get fat or something.

# Top 5: Benefits of the New Setup

0. I feel cooler
0. I get more control over how this looks (although right now it's very much *not* something I've got a handle on)
0. I have a local repository of my posts on my computer
0. I can write using Markdown, in a text editor, & do version control via [GitHub](http://www.github.com), all of which makes me feel cool
0. I get to practice using all of the above, so I could (in theory) apply those skills to other projects.

There will actually be better benefits once I figure out all my newfound powers. Like footnotes[^1].

# Quotes

> **You and Markdown, man. Ugh.**  
> *- Nick*

> **COWABUNGA!**  
> *- The Cookie Monster, who's quickly become my favorite philosopher*

Motto: The Point of this Post is to Make You Hate Me

  
It was St. Patrick's day yesterday, and I think that's the one day of the year we all like to gather and give thanks. I recognize that I have a ton to be thankful for, seriously. The following is a non-exhaustive list of advantages with which I've been blessed:

* I grew up in a household with both my parents. The whole upbringing turned out to be a sneaky way to teach me how to be part of a successful and happy relationship.
* I was the youngest kid in the family... by several years. I learned how to schmooze people, but I also learned how to be independent. Also, my two older sisters absorbed most of the parental worries. I totally had it easy.
* I am a white male. This shouldn't be an advantage in today's society, but it's part of the way people approach me and has surely affected the opportunities I've had.
* I'm between 6'8" and 6'9" and possess at least a small amount of natural athleticism.
* I have this face:

* I graduated college with a degree in a highly marketable, very well respected field.
* I have a fantastic set of friends. They are the best people in the world and that's why I'm friends with them. I'm lucky I found a way to make them stuck with me.
* I'm engaged to the most beautiful, wonderful, and impressive person I've ever met.
* Lastly: I live in a world with Google and Marvel movies.

Google just blew the lid off the wearable technospace. That word I just made up shouldn't distract you from just how important Google's announcement was today.  
  
Android Wear is soon going to be a thing... and it looks fantastic.  
  
  
Top 5: Disadvantages I also Have

5\. I own a cat, but no dogs  
4\. Despite several attempts to learn, I have near zero swimming ability  
3\. The inability to choose what things I find extremely interesting  
2\. I have some sort of autoimmune disease that may or may not affect me for the rest of my life  
1\. I _also_ have this face:

It took me 6.8 years to think of two words. 

I grown to **hate** the name "Life Tracker". It's an embarrassing entry in the nomenclature of "Aaron Projects". It was the first, most obvious thing I could think to use. The name is what it attempted to do. It's not that I'm not a creative person. It's that I'm scared of committing to seemingly arbitrary labels for things. [Remember when I was going to start calling the Column "WVZ7X7"](https://aarongilly.com/111)? Yeah, I forgot too. It was only when I put The Life Tracker in the context of a greater System that I realized what role it was fulfilling, and subsequently what name it should be given:

> Data Journal

That's what it is - a structured journal with emphasis on data gathering & consolidation. When I read ["The Bullet Journal Method" by Ryder Carrol](https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/) I kept thinking, "man this guy's system seems to fulfill the same basic goals I had with my whole Life Tracking thing". To quote a professor I once had: "Things are only obvious when they're obvious." - *Don't remember which*.

Now I have a new naming dilemma.

# The Unnamed System for Doing What You Want and Getting What You Want Out of Life

As I hinted about in my previous post, about a month ago I had one of those awesome moments where you connect together multiple ideas from what used to be independent domains. 

![[385-2.png]]

I connected the things I've been doing for forever with the things I've been doing for only a long time, with the books I've been reading recently, with the direction I want to shift my focus. They've all coalesced into one big thing.

Here's is a rough-cut process map of what I'm talking about:

![[385-1.png]]

There are a few main components (green blocks), and a few main processes (blue blocks) that connect them. The processes may change, as may the components, but I think what's there represents most of what I've been thinking about over the past month.

The rest of this post is breaking down that diagram. Skip to the end if you're uninterested.

# Components

## 5 Year Plan
This is literally a plan for the next 5 years, by year. It's a list of tangible, measurable, and time-based goals. The plan can be as specific or nonspecific as you like. I like to keep next year pretty well-defined (10 to 15 specific goals) and have future years be a little more vague (1 to 5 broad goals). As you accomplish goals, check them off. When putting together your plan, keep in mind your context will change over time. Ask yourself "how old will I be this year?" "How old will my loved ones be?" "are there any milestones anyone will be hitting?". Keep it on a piece of paper, or in a notes application. It doesn't matter. Choose to share it with someone, or keep it to yourself. Keep it handy, but there's no need to look at it every day.

## Identity Statement
This is a description of the person you want to be in 5 years. A LOT can change in 5 years, so keep it ambitious. There's no reason you can't wholly change your situation, so keep it optimistic. I prefer to keep mine in a list. In the year 20__, I will (be)/(have)/(live)/(do)... 

## Data Manifest
This is a big topic. I could write a ton about this and not be done yet. To keep this post manageable, I'll just say the Data Manifest is where you intersect the things you want to do and be with the means by which you track them. It is a list of things to measure, what they are, why you're measuring them, how/when/where they are measured. If you're not the person doing the measuring, then you get "who". A quick example:  
 **Sleep Duration**  
 - What: how long my main sleep was each night
 - Why: I believe adequate and consistent sleep is vital to overall health and happiness
 - When: after waking up
 - Where: in my sleep app
 - How: automatically captured by my sleep app
 - (Who: me)
 
 My Data Manifest is currently 60 items long. I suspect most people would want fewer tracking points, but I believe everybody could benefit from having at least a few entries.

## Data Journal
If the Data Manifest is the recipe, the Data Journal is meal. It is the combined set of points tracked according to the Data Manifest. It is populated consistently and constantly, via manual and automated means. It tracks your habits and whatever measures you want it to. It acts as a journal, full of timestamped reflections about life. It can also be home to any other sort of event logging task you might find handy. Data Journaling is another big topic that I could write a ton about. Automation of said journal alone could be a whole book.

## Habits List
This is a written list of the habits I am practicing in order to achieve my long-term goals and bring me closer to who I want to be. These will be housed in the Data Manifest, but are important enough to be called out here.

## Challenge List
This is a written list of month-long challenges you have taken or plan to take as part of your system. Keeping them nearby your identity statement and your 5 year plan can be helpful in developing these goals. Keeping them in one place and writing down a review of them is helpful for keeping track of what has or has not worked for you. 

## Getting Things Done (GTD) System
There literally is a book written about this - ["Getting Things Done" by David Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/). Suffice to say, a Getting Things Done System is comprised primarily of an inbox, a task manager and calendar, and weekly review (upon which I'm building later).

# Processes 

## 5 Year Planning Process
The process starts with a 5 Year Plan. This plan gets reviewed & renewed each December, and after any major life-changing events (or, you know, whenever you want). It is more than a 5 year plan, though. It's a goal *identity*. It's a forcing an answer to the question "why?" in the long, medium, and short-term. 
- Who you want to be in 5 years? 
- Why do you want to be that person? (*identity statement*)
- What has that person accomplished? By when? (*5 Year Plan*)
- Where do I need to be in one year to be where I want in 5 Years?
- What does that person *do* in order to be who they are, and accomplish those things? (*Habits List* and *Monthly Challenge List*).
- What can I start doing today to get me there? What habits should I adopt?
- Of the list of things I can start doing, how can I track them? 
- Are there any metrics or measures I can use to track my progress toward my goal identity? (*Data Manifest* and *Data Journal*)

## Ongoing Capture
Throughout the day you'll encounter triggering events (as defined in your Data Manifest). These events will cause measures to be taken & either recorded in your Data Journal directly, or recorded elsewhere, to be moved to your Data Journal at a later date. A goal here is to automate as many of these inputs as possible. You'd be surprised what you can accomplish with a small amount of ingenuity. [You'd be more surprised what's already being done for you](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb). Best practices for batch export of data from some alternate repositories could again be the subject of another, long discussion. [Others have covered this topic well](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger).

## Daily Review
At the end of each day, record in your journal a couple of sentences about the day. What happened? How did you feel? What were you thinking about or working on? Then fill in any daily metrics/measures that weren't already captured. Lastly, quickly look at tomorrow's tasks & appointments, take those in concert with current realities and come up with a short list of 1 to 3 priorities for tomorrow.

## Weekly Review
At the end of each week (I prefer Friday), do a comprehensive review of your Getting Things Done system. Clear your inboxes. Check in with every active Project you've got going. Check in with all upcoming tasks and appointments. Do this standard set of actions as instructed by David Allen. On top of that, check in with any weekly measures you've deemed necessary. Catch up any missing data points that you can. Look at your Monthly Challenge. How is it going? Are you on track? If not, can you get back on track? 

## Monthly Review
At the end of each month, check in with your habits list. Have you been keeping up with them? Do you need to continue tracking them? Reflect on the monthly challenge you've just finished. How did it work? What lessons have you taken away from it? What challenge do you want to do next month? Review your measures and metrics for the month. Record measures that have a monthly scope (e.g. budgets).

## Annual Review
Basically just reflecting on what you've accomplished this year towards what you had planned. Thinking about the year overall. Looking at the measures and metrics in aggregate. Looking at previous years, if you have those data. The annual review is followed immediately by the next 5 Year Planning Process. 

# Closing thoughts
I want to write way more about all of the sections above. Then I want to write about how the systems could be reduced if you decide not to do the whole comprehensive list of processes and components. If this is the "high" level of keeping yourself accountable and on-track, there are natural "medium" and "low" level points that still offer a huge ROI that I think would be palatable to a larger audience.

Obviously I don't have space to do that writing today. Honestly I'm on the fence about putting future writings about this specific topic on the Column at all. I doubt you readers, who come here looking for brief insights about Aaron and his musing aren't interested in multiple longform pieces about this one specific thing. If you're interested, let me know.

# **Top 5: Very Specific Subcomponents/Subprocesses about which I could write for days**

1. Goal mapping
2. Options for GTD system components
3. Data analysis & visualization
4. Principles and selecting trackable habits for them
5. A litany of options in the space of automated data capture

Motto: Jason Unbourne  
  
I haven't written in a while because I haven't had internet in a while. Melissa and I are moving to a full-blown house in less than a week\*. Rather than pay for a half-month of internet, I elected to go ahead and cancel our home service. MELISSA and (sorta) I have been packing up our entire place, so the free time has been reduced somewhat. Packing and consolidating and repacking and reconsolidating. Plus working, maintaining a decent-ish workout routine, a social life, and a happy/healthy relationship... the Column has taken a backseat.  
  
\*assuming all goes as planned.  
  
Pokemon Go exploded. It's huge in a way I would not have believed one month ago. I've got mixed feeling about it and its popularity - but that hasn't stopped us from "Pokemoning" for hours on end many times over the past two weeks. I'm level 18 as of this writing. I hope to be level 19 by the time I finish this post (assuming any pokemon show up at all at Whole Foods). Thanks to this game, I've visited Loose Park, gone to the Plaza twice, been to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art... but I've been mostly staring at my phone during that time. Right now I'm mostly for it. Melissa and I are having fun together, and that's what matters to me most. I'll have more fun when I find a Charizard.  
  
"Jason Bourne" came out. Spoilers: it was hugely disappointing. I revere the first 3 movies as my top 3 favorite movies in the action genre. This one was devastatingly disappointing. I'm more hard on it than most of the critics I've read. I thought it was mostly a pile of garbage. I rewatched the original trilogy in anticipation of the new one. They hold up - so I know it's not just "my tastes have changed"... it's that "Jason Bourne" didn't have NEARLY enough actual _Jason Bourne_. There was too much bullcrap "tech" stuff jammed in. Too much side character focus. Too much side plot. WAY TOO MUCH shakeycam. Overall I give the film a "WHY" out of ten.  
  
Thursday Melissa and I will become homeowners. That puts us one dog and 2.4 children away from "The American Dream". I'm all for it. I can't wait to have a place to settle down, build up some equity, and begin the next phase of my life with my wife whose the love of my life. We've been doing a pretty good for the past four years (which you'll have the chance to glimpse into soon), but I get a feeling that by staying put we're about to start really going places. We love the place, and have some ideas that hopefully will make us love it even more. I'm sure I'll have pictures on here soon.  
  
Jason Bourne, Pokemon Go, I've got one other piece of trending thing Aaron opinions to share - it's about the Prisma app. I'd heard about it in weeks past in many of the various tech-related podcasts I listen to on my commute, but I hadn't bothered getting around to try it until earlier today.  
  
Holy crap.  
  
It's cool, dude. I don't need to tell you, though, I can just show you:

Only 359 days until my next one. Come that day I bet I'll probably use that as my Top 5.  
  
Top 5: Pros of Owning a House (I assume)  
5\. SO MUCH MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES!  
4\. Seriously, so much more room. Room for a kid. Room for guests. Room for a gym. Room for an office. Room for a second bathroom. Room for a 3rd. Room to park your cars.  
3\. Freedom to do what you want. "I think I'd like to draw a big smiley face on this wall." "I think I'd like to play the djembe even though it's 2am." "I think I'd like to change how this looks."  
2\. Not throwing money away on a monthly basis. Plus, the amount you get in return for the increased cost is really pretty amazing. I can't believe how little our monthly payments are going up compared to the amount we get back from it.  
1\. Having a place that is really and truly _yours_.  
  
Top 5: Cons of Owning a House (I assume)  
5\. "Well it turns out I need to move to Cleveland... should I go through the hassle of selling my house or just slam every finger I own in every door I own instead?"  
4\. Big ticket expenses that could hit at any time.  
3\. No more "maintenance guys" to call when something breaks.  
2\. There's only TWO Pokestops within walking distance. What is this, the Dark Ages?  
1\. Mowing the lawn. I don't care if it's not a "manly" thing to say, mowing the lawn sucks.

# Motto: You're Not Special

The motto is both a reoccurring theme from Fight Club and a reference to the fact that I am starting this column without hoping to fulfill or achieve some grand purpose. I am writing to write, and that's alright.

List of things I'm not doing in this update:
* Specially made media
* Unveiling of massive projects
* Lists of words or any other sort of feature
* Addressing some sort of massive backlog

I recently read an article titled "[The Smartphone is Dead](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-smartphone-is-dead-2013-8". It's essentially one guy pointing out that phones have plateaued. No recently new phone has really been much better than what was already out there. 1080p screens are an unnecessary bump from the 720p standard from last year. 8 cores perform only marginally better than 4, which only perform marginally better than 2. My Nexus 4 came out 10 months ago, and it hasn't yet been definitively dethroned as a top-tier device*. A couple years back, 10 months would have been an eternity. A new phone back then was obsolete within 2 months... now the performance differences across devices has become mostly negligible. Every review for every phone says "it's very smooth, almost no hiccoughs at all." The argument the article was making was that "*all devices are pretty much the same, and it's silly for them to try and differentiate themselves with useless gimmicks*". I agree.

So, what's next then? The Smartwatch? Google Glass? Who knows.

I live in a truly fantastic era.

* I would concede that the Google Play Edition of the HTC One is better than my phone, but it's really pretty close.

I do want the New Nexus 7, by the way.

I've been reading on/using different code breaking and coding techniques. I've learned more about Enigma, AES, simple substitution (such as ROT13), and "[The Dancing Men](https://www.os3.nl/_media/2009-2010/students/axel_puppe/ssn/dancemen.jpg".  People are smarter than me. Some people. Maybe it's because they are really dedicated. Maybe it's because I waste my time on the internet looking at funny pictures.

But, come on, how can you turn down finding things like this:

![wacky waving inflatable arm false tubeman](assets/105-1.gif)

I guess I'm doomed.

The last thing I want to write about right now has to do with the quote at the end of the column. I listen to This Week in Tech weekly. It's one of a few podcasts I make sure to catch every week. Ever since the whole "The NSA is collecting everyone's information in alarming rates" thing, they have been concerned about privacy. That's where the quote comes from, and it is a sentiment I have voiced in the past and it was great hearing somebody else say the same thing.

Maybe I should have plans for my posts from now on. This was not my best.

OH OH ONE OTHER THING! Starting THIS WEDNESDAY, I'm going to try to write updates on a more scheduled, intentional basis. I'm thinking every Wednesday and Sunday.

# Top 5: Podcasts I Listen To

5. This Week in Tech
4. This Week in Google
3. ...
2. ...
1. This American Life


# Quote:

> **“Ultimately someone's going to have all your information. I'm almost happier that it's with one person, rather than scatter shot across a zillion different startups with varying levels of security. I tend to trust Google more than, you know, 'start up X'. So if Google continues to innovate and do interesting things, I'm reasonably comfortable with them having my data.”**

# Motto: One man’s trash is another man’s trash

I just got my new computer. It is a refurbished ASUS that I got a great deal on. It is sleek looking. It is light. It is also completely and totally useless. The thing started up for the first time alright. I installed Chrome on it. I uninstalled useless frivolities like "ASUS WebStorage". After finishing that, I right clicked on the desktop to change the background and the computer BLUE SCREENED. This brand new computer with a fresh operating system threw up all over me. I thought, "no, there's no way". I restarted the computer - only to find that the HDD is no longer being recognized. It, by the way, is where the operating system is located. So, again, my new computer is nothing other than an expensive paperweight.

Not the right context for this picture, but otherwise it fits perfectly:
![](assets/58-1.gif)
Ron Swanson is a man.

ASUS is having me send it in to them (on my dime) to fix the problem. I am irate that I had this problem to begin with. When you "refurbish" something, it shouldn't die permanently within a half hour when I turn it on.

Anyway.   I started my New Year’s resolution last Monday. As you may recall, I resolved to live a more structured, consistent life. This involved intentional sleep and rise times, workouts, and dietary and monetary constraints. During this week, a couple of things happened. One, I realized just how hopelessly unstructured I had been living. I found I hard to start cold turkey (can you start something cold turkey?). I frequently stayed up later than expected, slept in, and ate out. I only worked out 3 of the 5 days, and one of those “workouts” was a 10 minute stretching routine before a shower. The other thing that happened: I had the best, most productive week I’ve had since I started keeping score with the Demetri List. I hypothesized that increased structure would show results in the Demetri List and, from what I can tell so far, signs seem to be pointing that way.   This week, so far, I’ve held up all of my contractual resolutionatory (made up word) obligations to myself. On a related note: It’s only Monday... and I've stayed up too late already.   This week at work I learned a semi-low-level-but-not-entirely-technical view of how cell phones and the network behind them work. It was amazing, confusing, frustrating, enlightening, and, most of all, very humbling. It makes me respect even more the phone companies, the many many people who created these systems, and the many many people who work every day to maintain them.   Allow me to summarize everything I learned into one easy-to-digest paragraph:   It’s magic.   Technically, that’s a whole paragraph. I know because I looked it up. Online (that was my subtle movie quote for this column. I’m still doing those, btw). 

I watched KU beat West Virginia at Power and Light in KC. I took this photosphere:

This topic, the intersection of philosophy and technology, is probably my favorite and most-covered topic over these past 437 Columns. Technology is like fashion. It’s never “done”. With each new development in technology, there’s reason to think about what rights and wrongs come from it.

# Consumer Tech Form Factors

## The Smart Watch

My favorite class of consumer electronics is the smart watch. A smart watch adds the most benefit with the fewest drawbacks.

My Apple Watch:

- allows me to message people
- handles short phone calls
- handles timers, alarms, reminders, etc
- tracks and report on my exercise
- allows me to run shortcuts and ask Siri questions
- allows me to find my phone, unlock my computer, and do other ecosystem stuff
- shows me the time

My Apple Watch will NOT:

- allow me to accidentally ruin an evening looking at the internet

It facilitates health and connection. It doesn't demand your attention. You won't see people who are lost in “their watch”. 

## The Smart Earbuds

A new piece of tech I wouldn’t want to live without is some nice, noise-canceling earbuds.

My AirPods:

- Allow to me focus on the task at hand
- Read me books while I mow
- Protect my ears while I mow
- Blunt the harshness of a 2 year old throwing a tantrum (just using them as earplugs, even without anything playing)
- Allow me to take and make hands-free calls
- Allow me to interact with Siri

The AirPod **does**, though, have a large portion of the blame for making random people less approachable. Little white earbuds are now ubiquitous, making idle chit chat between strangers waiting in line less frequent. They are too good at “shutting out the world”.

## The Tablet

Tablets are the most “fun” class of consumer electronics. They are probably the most versatile piece of consumer electronics available.

My iPad:

- Is my favorite way to browse the internet
- When combined with headphones, is much better than a TV for solo movie watching
- Is an infinite piece of paper and an impossibly capable pencil that never runs dry
- Is a CAD device that can also scan in 3D models
- Is capable enough for a hobbyist for editing music, videos, photos, and podcasts
- Is what I’m writing this Column on
- Is more capable of playing games than I give it credit for[^1]
- Is a good way to read books, PDFs, etc
- Allows me to markup PDFs, I can even do crosswords with the Apple Pencil

While it is very easy to lose a night playing around on an iPad, I find that when I'm on it I'm generally doing something more worthwhile or productive… or at least I'm enjoying myself more than comparable time spent on my phone.

## The Rest

The **computer** still has its role. For as much as I love my iPad, there’s still no great way to write code on an iPad. I’ve looked into it, trust me. Every solution out there doesn’t *really* work as well as having VS Code and a full internet browser on my computer.

The **smart speaker** was a not-so-brief flash in the pan, I think. We have a ton and we use them every day - but for reasons I’ll get into in my next Column… I’ve been thinking Alexa isn’t actually “adding” to my life. Having ready access to decent sound, especially sound that can be piped simultaneously to multiple speakers around the house, still feels like living in the future to me.

The **TV** is the best thing for communal experiences. The only piece of tech that my family and I can really enjoy simultaneously (aside from music from the speakers).

Finally, we have **the phone.** The phone is really only “the best” as a camera. In every other way the phone is outmoded by something else in the ecosystem. This gets to the point I'm trying to make here…

## Unsupported “Ideal”

Screw the phone.

Apple assumes everyone has an iPhone. It's the primary device. It's the de facto “king” of your technology, as ordained by the church of Cupertino. You cannot use an iPad and Apple Watch together without an iPhone to bind them. 

![[438-2.jpg]]

In a hypothetical world where I lived a “digital nomad” life, or just adopted brazen minimalism for whatever other purpose, I could see really enjoying a “Apple Watch + AirPods + iPad + Mac” setup[^2]. As previously mentioned, the **only** thing you'd *really* be missing is the stellar camera on the iPhone. The simple removal of the little device in your pocket would free you from the tyranny of the ubiquitous access to the addictive little dopamine device. I think life would be better.



# Odds and Ends

- We took a vacation to South Dakota to obtain a new brother-in-law/uncle for my sons. He's good. Vacation was good. Wedding was good. Pretty idyllic situation overall, I'd say.
	- We took our Model Y on a road trip for the first time. More thoughts on that in my next Column.
- I just discovered that holding the "option" button on my iPad allows me to easily access weird off-keyboard characters, easy as π.
- My back, neck, and shoulder are **still** hurting from the work I did fixing our backyard water feature over a month ago. Possibly related: I turn 35 next month. 🙃
- Said water feature is finally functional again, though!

# Top 5: Potential Site Changes to Come

I try not to promise changes to the site, but here’s some I’ve been thinking about. 



## 5. Re-introduction of ‘Gillespedia’

It didn’t go away. I just hid the link. I have several articles I’d like to write. Arguably this post should have been one.



## 4. Folding in of My Notes

If I switched from Notion, I'd figure out a way for my notes to live in the Column, as well.



## 3. More Integration with Get In To Win

There's one link right now. Ideally this could better support that, and any future podcasts I may formulate.



## 2. The Still-Outstanding Deep Dive on the PDW

I am planning to write an “all about it” page. What it is and how it works, both from a laymen's perspective and a technical one. 



## 1. TOTAL OVERHAUL

I’m interested in moving this site from its current tech stack to something else entirely. You’ll know this happened if suddenly one day the site looks totally different.

It's been a while since I talked about EDC[^1] directly, and I'm not sure if I've ever directly covered one bag travel. Let's rectify that.

Also - I felt like drawings lots of things in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), so get ready for that too.

# I've got Baggage

Remember [[345|Column 345 about the Backpack]]? I love bags. I have too many of them, but I primarily use these.

## Timbuk2 Never Check Expandable Backpack

![[345-1.jpg]]

Already extensively covered in [[345|Column 345]].

## Osprey Daylite Plus

![[469-7.jpeg]]

My black Timbuk2 bag is great, but also more than I need for most things. Often I only need to hold my iPad, a water bottle, and a protein bar. Enter the Osprey Daylite Plus. It's *awesome*. In fact, when you stack it side-by-side with my other backpack, the Timbuk2 does not look good:

|                      | Timbuk2 Never Check Expandable Backpack | Osprey Daylite Plus |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Capacity             | 21 liter to 25 liter                    | 20 liter            |
| Water bottle holder  | 1 small one                             | 2 huge ones         |
| Luggage pass thru    | No                                      | Yes                 |
| Reservoir compatible | No                                      | Yes                 |
| Slip pocket          | Technically, yes                        | Yes & it's better   |
| Bag name             | Stupid                                  | Less stupid         |
| Weight               | 2.6 lbs                                 | 1.3 lbs             |
| Build quality        | Great                                   | Also great          |
| Price                | $230                                    | $75                 |

The difference between 2.6 pounds and 1.3 pounds is **really noticeable** when you're walking around with a bag on your back all day. Also the bag takes up so much less space when it's empty. This much less fancy, much less expensive bag has nearly entirely replaced my "nicer" one. This fits in with a recurring theme/principle[^2] in my life: Less, but Better.

## A Duffle (or) Rolling Carry On

Sometimes you need to bring more stuff. These are my volume options. I like the one with wheels when I'm going on plane trips and the soft-sided one for when I'm going on car trips. They're both capable of holding around ~40 liters. They get the clothes, often segmented into packing cubes.

I find lots of write-ups like these focus heavily on the *clothes themselves*. I'm a weirdly-sized individual and don't think that my clothes recommendations would really apply to anyone under 6'4".[^3] I don't have a "standard" set of travel clothes. They're always picked and packed uniquely for whatever the trip needs. 

# Modules

I used to be the kind of organized person who wanted a 1000 little pockets for each of the 1000 little things. Now I'm much more a fan of the "bag in a bag" approach. Something my wife has advocated forever.

## Actual Everyday Carry

![[469-6.jpeg]]

I don't carry anything that doesn't comfortably fit in my pockets. Thus, my actual EDC is:
- An aging iPhone
- An aging Apple Watch
- A thin no-name wallet
- AirPods Pro
- Occasionally: multitool or pocket knife

### Water Bottle

My water bottle isn't on me 24/7 like the above, but it's pretty darn close. I definitely have a water bottle on me more often than the multitool/pocket knife. It ends up in every bag I have, or just generally sitting nearby. I bring it with me into places like Jimmy Johns, rather than produce the waste of getting a cup for water. 

My water bottle of choice is still the 40oz Ice Shaker which I covered in [[440#Water Bottle Analysis 2023|Column 440]].

## Evergoods Civic Access Pouch

![[469-6.png]]

The most interesting part of this Column, I'd guess, is my Evergoods Civic Access Pouch. This is **the bag** that is my "bag in a bag". It goes into whatever backpack I'm using. It goes on my desktop at work and at home. This holds my daily-but-not-quite-EDC stuff. It is lightweight, firm enough to retain its shape but not rigid, and segmented enough to stay organized without *forcing* the use of its various pockets. Its killer feature, though, is the way that it opens up to a wedge shape, providing stability while displaying its contents for easy access. This functions like a desk drawer that's always at whatever table I'm working from. 

![[469-9.jpeg]]

In this case is:
- General self-care things (travel toothbrush, lotion, lip balm, & some painkillers for errant headaches or whatever)
- Post-its (for a [Daily Post-It](https://gillespedia.com/Daily+Post+It))
- Writing implements (sharpie & pen)
- Protein bar and/or drink mix packets
- This [awesome all-in-one travel charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Compatible-Wireless-Certified-Foldable/dp/B0D8PYWHZR/) (THANKS ED & MICHELE)
- A very small leatherman (not included on airplane loadouts)
- Empty space enough for other ad hoc uses (e.g. sunglasses)

This organizer is awesome.[^4] 

## Lunchbox

![[469-11.jpeg]]

The humble lunchbox gets not the appreciation it deserves. Our family is very much into the concept of "Meal Prep", and a decent lunchbox & bento boxes enable that habit. My lunchbox is its own ice pack. It lives neatly tucked into the bottom shelf of the freezer door. When I pull it out each morning it's cold and good to go.

## Charger & Cables Bag 

![[469-10.jpeg]]

My chargers & cables bag is the result of a bad itch I needed scratched nearly a decade ago. Its contents have evolved some, but still it basically just holds chargers & cables. Everything in this bag lives in it permanently - it is not emptied between trips. It's a grab-and-go "I've got all the chargers & cables we'll need" solution.

- USB-C to USB-C x2 (one long, one short)
- USB-C to lightning[^5]
- USB to lightning[^5]
- Lightning to 3mm headphone adapter[^5]
- Apple watch OG Charger
- Travel Apple Watch USB dongle
- A high-powered multi-USB wall adapter for simultaneous charging overnight
- A small portable power bank
- A pen
- Some Tylenol / ibuprofen 

## Dopp Kit

There's no picture here, because I've not found a Dopp Kit[^6] setup that I like. Some day I'll get a bug in me and need to flex my consumerist muscles to get some "perfect dopp kit setup" that achieves the same job as my charger & cables bag. Until then, this is the weakest area of my packing game. I like to use mouthwash, and despite using travel-sized mouthwashes and travel-sized hair products, it just doesn't *quite* fit everything I'd want it to. So I end up with another bag that routinely gets forgotten in the bathroom at my in-laws'.

# Motto: Aaron Go Brag (somewhere else)

The motto is my Anglicised form of [Erin Go Bragh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Go_Bragh). Which apparently truly Irish people don't say, or at least don't spell like that anyways.

Here's the way the rest of this column is going to go down: I'm going to briefly recap my recent trip to KC Irishfest, move on into the greater sense of Irishness and take a brief look into my roots, then "the wait", and end off with a random Top 5 about tech factionism, which is a word I made up for this post.

Melissa and I went to the tenth annual Irishfest in Kansas City this weekend. It was our second time attending the festival, the first time where we went there on purpose. During our 7 hours there we saw, amongst other things, Irish bands, dancers, comedians, and a 7 foot tall guy that I walked by in shame. On our way to buy tickets to get in, an old man handed us two tickets for free. My streak of good luck continues. 

An interesting note, Melissa and I accidentally recreated a photo we took exactly 2 years ago:

![](assets/29-1.jpg)

Comparison notes: I got happier. Melissa and I both adopted one-strap bags. The fountains got lighter.
The weight of heritage at Irishfest got me thinking about my own. I don't know what exactly it is that makes up my lineage. I know there's some Irish in there. The only thing I really have to go off of at the moment is my name:

Aaron - Hebrew, likely Egyptian. Meaning either "mountain" or "enlightenment".
Gillespie - Originally Scottish or Irish, Anglicized to its current form. Meaning "Servant of the bishop".

I guess I serve people that like moving in only diagonal lines.

Interestingly, my idea for the tattoo I was considering (I'm not getting a tattoo, mom and dad, don't worry) showed strong Celtic and Egyptian symbolism before I realized their significance in my name. It was something like the following:

![oh I'm so deep it hurts](assets/29-2.jpg)

The tattoo idea that ended up just being a wallpaper for my phone for a few months.

I could do a Top 5 things I'm waiting for right now, but I already wrote my Top 5. So, instead, I'm waiting for a 64gb flash drive and official job offer to come in the mail, to move into my own place by myself for the first time, the new Armored Kill Battlefield 3 update to download, and, as always, the newest tech news (Motorola phone with no bezel, the iPhone 5, Windows and Windows Phone 8, and the once rumored fleet of Nexus devices, to name a few). This post was written to pass the time, hence it kind of sucks.

The following Top 5 is my recent thoughts about jumping into any one tech company's pool fully. This means no mixing of the breeds. No iPhone with a Window's computer, etc. Before we do that, I should remind everyone of my allegiance:

# Top 5+1: Technological factions to get behind right now, and what that means for you both now and in the future, when your phone and computer are almost entirely inseparable (just IMHO)

## 5. Open Source 
Desktop PC you built from scratch running some Linux Distro + Probably WebOS Phone
First off, I admire your spirit. Secondly, I feel kind of sorry for you.

## 4. Blackberry 
Your IMB ThinkPad laptop from work + Whatever new Blackberry.
You've already lost and will continue to lose. Even if Blackberry 10 is awesome, you'll probably still lose.

## 3. Apple 
Your <3 years old Macbook Pro + the newest or second newest iPhone + iCloud + optional iPad + Safari
It's now ironic that Apple's slogan 15 years ago was "think different", considering now its slogan would be more along the lines of "Join the Hivemind". Going Apple is now so standard that hipsters are doing it ironically. Going Apple means your software and hardware will always be tightly integrated and you'll never have compatibility issues within your own ecosystem... but that nicely formatted Microsoft Word document you just finished might look a bit funny on your professor/boss's Windows unit. Going Apple is a solid choice if you are okay with being like everyone else (which, honestly, isn't a bad thing! There's a reason it's so popular). Oh, and your hardware will always be more expensive than it really should be.

## 2. Microsoft 
Windows 8 Desktop + Windows Phone 8 + @Outlook.com email address + Optional Surface Tablet + Internet Explorer 9
There was a time when going Microsoft was laughable notion... with the upcoming release of Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8, this is no longer the case. As far as I'm concerned, Microsoft is poised nicely to make a roaring comeback. Your new Windows 8 Phone should (in theory) integrate perfectly with your new Windows 8 Desktop or Laptop... think iPhone/Macbook level integration. Doing so, you'll have some really nice things going for you. However, I just can't shake the feeling that Microsoft is going to overextend some with what it's going for, or they will miss the target wildly in some areas. If they can keep bloatware off systems and provide a truly compelling reason to go Windows, even I would consider it strongly.

## 1. Google 
Newest or 2nd newest generation Android Phone + @gmail.com email address + Chromebook + Optional Nexus Tablet + Chrome Browser
The internet is your noble companion and just about your only option in some aspects. Actually going with a ChromeOS computer as your only option is really a bad idea if you ever want to do anything serious. Gmail and Android, however, will always be the shining beacons of giving the consumers exactly what they need cleanly and without a lot of extra crap. Android is now, and will likely continue to be, the best thing that exists. It's just science.

## +1. Facebook 
Facebook on all the browsers at all times + potential "Facebook Phone"
Your actions, friends, photos, location, and thoughts are all monitored, cataloged, and indexed. You really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? If you elect to go the route of Facebook I don't like you. Also, the "Facebook Phone" will never actually happen.

# The Notes are Back

~6 months ago I switched by body of evergreen notes from [Notion](http://notion.so) to [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) as part of an effort to give these notes the best chance of still being around in 30 years. With that came the loss of the free notes publishing service. While Obsidian is stellar, their subscription for their publishing service is slightly too pricey for my taste at this point in time[^1]. So, I was unable to publish the 256 notes I’ve created since July, 2023.

That’s changed now: 

> [!tip]  [My notes](https://gillespedia.com).

That’s the master index. The notes aren’t laid out so that they can be read end-to-end[^2]. Instead, they’re this densely interlinked web:

![[449-1.png]]

Each of the circles in that image is a note. The lines between them represent hyperlinks. The color are bound to tags[^3]. So, as an alternative to the link above, see the Top 5 for five somewhat randomly-chosen starting off points.

## The [Standard Process](https://gillespedia.com/Standard%20Processes)

Despite how *involved* this whole thing looks, it's really not all that crazy or difficult.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Read something]
    B[Think of something]
    C[Hear something]
    D(Write it down)
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    E[Add to Obsidian & link to other notes]
    D --periodically--> E
```

It just involves using an [inbox](https://gillespedia.com/Inbox) to perform [ongoing capture](https://gillespedia.com/Ongoing%20Capture), and periodically cleaning it out. It's [nibbling at the elephant](https://gillespedia.com/Minimum%20Viable%20Progress), a [little bit, consistently](https://gillespedia.com/Small%20but%20Consistent%20beats-Big%20but%20Sporadic), [over time](https://gillespedia.com/Prefer%20a%20Long%20Term%20Philosophy).

**Note:** I don't plan to do this "linking to my notes everywhere" thing in most Columns. Doing it here because it's the point of this post.

# Other Local-First Changes

5 months ago I wrote about “[local vs the cloud](https://aarongilly.com/439/#notion--obsidian)” and my intention to become (slightly) less dependent on hardware & services that might [pull a Google](https://killedbygoogle.com). I presented my “[so what](https://aarongilly.com/439/#so-what)” to illustrate what I was going to do about it. Since that time I *also* successfully moved my quantified-self system to something that’s modularized and portable. I can run it locally, too.

Yay me.

[^1]: There’s a good chance this will change and at some point I’ll decide to subsidize their product by paying the $8/month their asking for to do something I can do for free.

[^2]: nor should any sane person want to.

[^3]: actually they're there to look pretty, mostly.

Motto:  "Sa-wat-dee-khrap" not "Sweaty Crap"


The motto is phonetically how you say "Hello" politely as a male speaker in Thai. I usually just said "hi". This column is a recounting of my trip to Thailand and my engagement to +Melissa Hill.

This post will have several pages worth of information, pictures, and one video. To keep the length of this post somewhat manageable, though, I'm going to employ my favorite space-saving technique:.

## The Trip Out:
I flew from Kansas City to Los Angeles, to Tokyo, to Bangkok.
I flew Delta. I will probably use them from now on if I have the option.
More about Delta will follow in my next column (I already have it planned)
I stayed up the night before my initial flight at 6am to try to nip jetlag in the bud.
I couldn't sleep on the plane due to being 6'8" to 6'9" and generally giddiness.
I had been awake for ~43 hours straight when I reached Japan. I took a sleeping pill when my plane was about to board.
My plane was delayed. 3 hours. I fell asleep on a bench.
I woke up as my plane was boarding - didn't alert Melissa I did, in fact, wake up.
I arrived in Bangkok around 3am (as opposed to the 11:30pm that was supposed to be)
Total transit time: Around 36 hours.
Somehow I missed Melissa, who was waiting for me at my gate.
I couldn't get a password for the WiFi.
Melissa thought I was still asleep in Japan.
I walked around BKK airport for an hour and fifteen minutes without any means to contact anyone before we ran across each other.
We hopped in a Taxi. I was, in a word, zonked.
## Initial Impressions:
Melissa's place
Really nice, actually. It was like a really good dorm room. She lives in an apartment without a roommate in Salaya, Thailand.
Mahidol University
The Univeristy at which Melissa works, based out of Salaya, is also really nice.
The campus was huge. Hard to compare it to KU, but it seemed to be of the same approximate size.
Wikipedia just told me they have 26 thousand students. KU has 29 thousand. Close!
Bangkok
Bangkok was weirdly exactly like I expected and nothing at all like I expected.
There are hundreds of skyscrapers littered throughout the landscape... but they are not all congregated in any one main area. You have vast expanses of small buildings, slums, parks, rivers, and favelas in between the huge, tall buildings. But no matter which way you look, you see sky scrappers in the distance.
The heat was bad, but not "the worst thing I've ever experienced" like I was expecting. 
Melissa said she was intentionally making it seem worse than it really was so I would be prepared.
There were monks walking around, but no elephants. I was only half disappointed.
## Temples:
The Grand Palace
The Grand Palace is huge. Huge and golden.
I've been to several big churches in the United States - but nothing I've ever seen even begins to compare to the Grand Palace. It's... astonishing.
There were a seemingly unending amount of shrines, buildings, artwork, and people.
The place was extremely dense with tourists. 
It was really hot and bright.
Wat Po
Although not as huge as the Grand Palace - still huge.
Less vertical. Less dense in general.
This included less people - which I loved.
Full of art and history and golden and rock statues of monks, little Buddhas, and the largest Buddha in Thailand.
32 feet tall. 141 feet long. (he's laying on his side)
There were many other temples we could have/were going to see; but that was the hottest day of the trip. This was exacerbated by the fact that we had to wear long pants to enter some of the temples. 
## Malls:
Being American, I enjoyed the malls quite a lot. There are 4 malls that are more or less in a line near the middle of Bangkok in Siam Square.
The malls decreased in "niceness" and "hugeness" as you went down the line from East to West.
The malls were the best example of just how much influence American culture has in other countries. 
I was sitting in the food court across from a Subway, Auntie Annes, Hagaan Daz, KFC, and a Burger King. The menus weren't quite the same - but everything was in English. You had to really look to find any Thai.
The largest mall, Siam Paragon, is 7 stories tall and houses hundreds of stores.
American stores like H&M, The Gap, Forever 21, and probably others that I don't even know about.
Other stores of note: Samsung, Sony, Ferarri (with actual cars), Prada, Versache, 
I realize it was largely targeted at foreigners ("Farang" as they said), but it was still quite surprising.
## Beaches:
The natural beauty of the jungles and beaches of Thailand cannot begin to be described in words. I would pit the beaches at the Similan and Surin Marine National Parks against any beach anywhere. Anywhere.
The sand was almost purely white and ultrafine. Individual grains of sand were impossible to see. It was like walking on powder. It was hard to tell where the sand ended and the water began.
The water was clear and full of coral and fish. Snorkeling there was unreal.
I hated snorkeling at first. After my brain realized I wasn't drowning, though, it was awesome. Tandem snorkeling with Melissa is an experience I'll never forget.
Probably the most impressive and great thing about the beaches was just how empty they were. There were hundreds and hundreds of feet of beach and less than 100 people there. You'll notice in the pictures later there are hardly any other people in the background. Try doing that in Florida.
Overall Impressions of the People in Thailand: 
The Thais are unanimously nice and courteous. They mind their own business and leave you be.
This wasn't just something I realized as an afterthought - this was something that shocked me every day I was there.
I wish America was halfway near that laid back.
People in Thailand are shorter in general. When we were riding one of the many forms of public transportation we used, Melissa was often (but not always) the second tallest person person or close to being the second tallest person on board. Having said that - they also react hilariously to tall people. They were never rude about it - but I could definitely tell they don't routinely see people who can't stand up on their buses.  
Speaking of public transit - it is used by normal people over there. Here (at least where I live) it seems like the bus stop is frequented only by the sketchiest of individual. I would pick bus stops in Thailand over Kansas City 100 days out of 100.
Ladyboys exist.
## Trip back:
The trip back was slightly shorter than the trip there. Probably 32 hours. 
It seemed much shorter, though, because I was travelling with the sun. I left Thailand and arrived in America on the same day, technically.
The landing in Japan was rough. Like, "I let out a bit of a yelp and grabbed the seat in front of me with white knuckles" rough.
They warned us about high winds ahead of time. They weren't joking.
I figured out the seats on the international flights CAN be sleepable if I sat a certain way.

The other thing I wanted to write about is the biggest thing that happened during the whole trip, if not the biggest thing that has ever happened in my life: 

I got engaged.

During the middle day of the trip, the 2nd of the three days we spent in the jungles and the beaches, I used the natural beauty of the landscape as the setting for the biggest question you ever get to ask anyone... Will you marry me?

She said yes.

(Check the quote at the end of this column for the actual transcript... I left out the long, stunned silence that occurred first.)

I manged to find a secluded section of the beach with a fantastic view. It was in the corner, near a group of interesting rocks. While she was taking pictures and enjoying the scenery, I was setting up a video camera and getting the ring out from it's hiding spot deep within our bag. The whole thing is on video.

Afterwards, we took several photos. Both on the beach, and later at the Kuraburi resort. This photo was taken were I asked her.

People in Thailand apparently love jump photos. This is for you guys.

Now, I present to you a clip-video from the craziest and best week of my life:

(editor's note from the future: this video lost to time)

Melissa and I are engaged to be wed. We have taken the next step towards the rest of our lives.. and I can't wait. 

![](assets/78-2.jpg)

That's Melissa. She's my fiancé.

I was going to do a Top 15 favorite photos. I was going to just link to an album of 50 photos and do a Top 5 photos. But I think, instead, I'll break the trip down into it's main four parts - each with it's own Photo Top 5.

# Top 5: Photos from Bangkok/Salaya

5. A Photosphere that was taken on the way to get a world-famous Thai massage.

4. Melissa and the reason she's in Thailand to begin with.

3. This gong is about 10 feet away from the previous picture - and yes, I did really hit it.

![](assets/78-5.jpg)

2. We have dozens of pictures from the malls, but I like this one best. It was the Me-est thing we found!

![](assets/78-6.jpg)

1. A bad representation of the Bangkok skyline (I don't really have a good one) behind an attractive couple.

# Top 5: Photos from the Temples

5. A great introductory picture. Thank you, Melissa, for suggesting it.

![](assets/78-8.jpg)

4. Me Wai-ing within the walls of the Grand Palace (the palace is mostly behind the camera).

![](assets/78-9.jpg)

3. Pretty self-explanatory.

2. These two pictures together paint a single picture of what it was like that day.

![](assets/78-11.jpg)

1. And these two pictures together paint a single picture of just how immature I am.

![](assets/78-12.jpg)




# Top 5: Photos from Beaches

5. This picture was taken within 5 minutes of our first glimpse of the ocean (which is behind the camera).

![](assets/78-13.jpg)

4. Melissa recreating her favorite photo from her first trip to Thailand at a new beach.

![](assets/78-14.jpg)

3. There were only about 25 people on the trip - I think Melissa was the first in the water.

![](assets/78-15.jpg)

2. Mermaid and Mer-man. I totally pulled it off better, by the way.

![](assets/78-16.jpg)

1. One of the first photos we took after the proposal - before the jump shot from before.

![](assets/78-17.jpg)




# Top 5: Engagement Photos

5. I do not like this photo. Amy said I "had" to post it, though. So I did cause she's tough.

![](assets/78-18.jpg)

4. Arguably my favorite photo that was posed for (I'm terrible at posing).

![](assets/78-19.jpg)

3. Correction: I like this one better.

![](assets/78-20.jpg)

2. I'm glad she likes me.

![](assets/78-21.jpg)

1. A genuine and natural smile from a genuine and natural beauty.

Yay! 🎉

# Limitations & Economics

In college I learned that "economics" is the study of unlimited wants in a world with limited resources. Despite the fact that economics was boring[^1], the general concept is something I find endlessly fascinating. How can you get what you want out of life with what you have?

The economics of life boil down to how you choose to use your great personal resources: time, money, and energy.

![Energy, Time, and Money](assets/418-1.jpg)

## Trading Resources

While we may not be able to exert much control over the total volume of these resources, we have *some* control over their proportions.

| Trade | Trade Forward | Trade Backward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time ↔️ Money | Work more hours. <br> Take a 2nd or 3rd job. <br> Fix your own car. <br> Paint your own house. |  Work fewer hours. <br> Try a part-time job. <br> Pay someone to fix your car. <br> Pay someone to paint your house. |
| Money ↔️ Energy | Pay someone to help you move. <br> Buy medicine. <br> Buy a better mattress. <br> Get a babysitter. | Move yourself. <br> Save the money and be sick. <br> Couches can be beds, too. <br> Never pay anyone for child care. |
| Energy ↔️ Time | Stay awake late at night. <br> Wake up super early. <br> Run. <br> Never exercise. | Go to bed early. <br> Sleep in! <br> Walk. <br> Exercise 60 minutes a day. |

# 10,000 Minutes

Did you know a week is 10,000 minutes long?[^1]

How the **hell** do 10,000 minutes go by every week? What happened!? It sounds like so much!

...but then if you take a serious look at the things you **have to** do and the things you **want to** do, it becomes clear: the week isn't enough.

## An "Ideal" Week

In order to be "living right", I'd want to spend:

- 56 hours - sleep 7.5 hours a night, which really means at least 8 hours dedicated to bedtime.
- 45 hours - work 40 hours week, which really means ~45 hours if you’re lucky with commutes and extra hours spent to get what needs done done.
- 11.5 hours - cook & eat your own meals, which I reckon is about 90 minutes day unless you’re doing fast food/convenience food for 2+ meals.
- 7 hours - maintain your relationship with your partner, which we’ll just call an hour a day for focused, direct relationship building. Playing games. Having real conversations. Going on dates.
- 14 hours - make memories with and enjoy your children. Playing toys with them. Teaching them things. Reading with them. Chasing them around yelling like you’re a monster.
- 14 hours - keeping your kids alive. Cleaning them. Making them eat. Taking them to and from places.
- 11.5 hours - maintain the stuff you own. Clean your house. Take your car into the shop. Fix that thing that broke. Update your computer. Do your laundry and dishes.
- 11.5 hours - pursue your own interests (have a hobby).
- 3.5 hours - exercise every other day for an hour.
- 3.5 hours - half an hour a day for bathing, grooming, dressing.
- 2.5 hours - shopping for the things you need to live.

We’ve got 168 hours to work with. **I just knocked out 179 of those 168**. 

That’s not even accounting for things like the >3 hours a day people spend looking at their phones, seeing friends and other family, any of the things that can easily zap entire days (e.g. being sick and trying to fix it), or any sort of above-and-beyond activity (say like writing a Column).

Imagine if you took the time to actually *read* those End User License Agreements and Terms of Services before clicking ‘agree’.

## A Realistic Week

- 49 hours - sleep 7 hours a night.
- 42.5 hours - work 40 hours. Live closer to your job.
- 7 hours - save a few hours eating stuff that’s bad for you.
- 21 hours - try to make memories with your kids while doing the things they need you to do to keep them alive.
- 2 hours - try to maintain your relationship primarily while doing other things (like cleaning)
- 21 hours - just zoning out. Thinking. Resting. Looking a screen for the purposes of escape or entertainment.
- 10 hours - maintaining the stuff you own, save a couple hours letting some broken things stay broken, letting some chores pile up.
- 7 hours - on that hobby of yours.
- 2.5 hours - only manage to work out 2 1/2 times each week.
- 3.5 hours - let’s just assume you bathe and groom per the plan.
- 2.5 hours - shopping.

168 hours with cut corners at every turn.

# So What Can We Do?

The day has 24 hours. Pretending that’s not true leads to failure, or worse - burnout *followed* by failure.

## Resource Usage Distribution

In an ideal world, you’d expend your resources in proportion with how they come to you naturally. If you make lots of money, you spend lots of money. If you’re naturally blessed with high levels of energy, you take up active hobbies. If you’ve got time, you take up time-intensive hobbies. If you’re out of alignment, see if you can trade one resource for another to get yourself back **in** alignment.

This is where I struggle. Almost all of my personal interests and hobbies traded time for money. 

This blog costs me $12/year to maintain, and that’s just cause I want the fancy URL. But I’ve been writing this post for 2 hours now.

My recent "[Wrapper-Lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrapper-lib)" coding project cost me $0 but took probably ~25 hours to get to its current state.

More generally I reckon I’ve spent weeks-to-months of hours working on the Personal Data Warehouse concept, and it’s still not really what I want it to be.

The workbenches I’m building in my garage have been probably 40+ hours at this point when I consider the design time, trip to the store for materials, and the few hours I’ve spent actually *building* them thus far.

## Be Realistic, but Ambitious

Don’t set yourself up for failure. You can only do so many things a day. You also don’t want to just "do nothing". Live on [the edge of your capability](https://www.notion.so/Edge-of-Capability-74d4ebc4966946619bfed77d2b7a3b18). The high edge. Not the low one.

# Other Stuff

## Personal Idiosyncrasies

I spend an unnecessary amount of time worrying about the ‘optimal’ way to characterize and assess things. The table above was the 4th iteration on presentation of "Trading Resources". I still don’t love it. Frankly I don’t even really like splitting "time" from "energy". I care about the *application of energy*, which requires time. This more aligns with the philosophy you’d find in something like ‘[Your Money or Your Life](https://www.notion.so/Your-Money-or-Your-Life-0997e4b2a72b4f3e9bef4159faef05ad)’. Or, perhaps, go in the *other* direction and split out mental energy from physical energy. Why not include spiritual energy? 

Does it **really** matter? Probably not. 

But where do you draw the line? Some things *have* to matter. We’re all just doing the best we can with what we’ve got.

## Consumer Tech Update

### Mac

My computer is now 7+ years old. [This is when I wrote about building it](https://aarongilly.com/226). I think it will be replaced soon. Probably with a Mac Mini or something similar.

### iPad Pro

I used my iPad Pro to take a 3D scan of the workbench I’m building. I can’t believe this is a thing that I can do. 

{% include video id="AFLQPrlMWP4" provider="youtube" %}

### AirPods

I finally got some AirPods Pro. They are cool. I just apologized to my wife for my iPad playing music loudly while she was trying to get some work done. I said "sorry, my AirPods aren’t working". 

Turns out my AirPods were working and spatial audio is *legit*.

Motto: He then let out a mighty, roaring mew

  
Melissa and I each got a kitten. We named them Thor and Loki and they are awesome. I am going to dedicate this Column to gushing about the kittens. I'm going to get out all of the crazy kitten pictures out of my system. Starting now.

All pictures taken by Melissa. She wanted credit. I'm giving her credit both for the pictures and for wanting the credit for the pictures.  
  
Continuing with the kitten theme - I made this recording earlier today:  
  
  
About the cats - they are interesting. I'm going to probably tell some stories about them at some point because they are interesting. They have these complex and unique personalities. They are so interesting.  
  
The following video is a one minute commitment:  
  
  
[Column #125 - The Asgardians - Volume 1](http://vimeo.com/77370821) from [Aaron Gillespie](http://vimeo.com/user21984197) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).  
  
I had to create a Vimeo account and upload that to Vimeo because YouTube muted the audio around which the structure of the video was built.  
  
This seemed to me like the perfect picture to go out on:

Top 5: Poetic Pet Peeves

5\. When people refer to "consciousness" as some sort of strange living being that is beyond their control.  
4\. Using obscure words for the sake of using obscure words.  
3\. Bad or simple rhymes or rhyme schemes.  
2\. Any usage of "Living in a world of..."  
1\. A metaphor or other attempt at deep thought that has to constantly explain itself.

Motto: WWDC stands for Wow. What a Developer's Conference

  
Everything I'm about to say might surprise some people, but it really shouldn't. This column is about Apple's developer's conference that happened a couple days ago and how impressed I am with their announcements. Here is a brief overview of what Apple announced. I'll be presenting it as "feature (prior art)" to illustrate that it's possible to do just that before making my final point that prior art doesn't matter.   

[![](assets/174-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nxh8WTn87B0/U5Dw-0Y0dtI/AAAAAAABXI0/aoiFHwAf6%5Fs/s1600/%23174+-+Yosemite.jpeg)

The Operating System that runs Mac computers is getting an upgrade by the name of "Yosemite". This update brings a number of changes:  
* Updated iconography (like iOS)
* An expanded notifications (like iOS)
* Safari upgrades (like Chrome in many respects)
* Mail markup (like Evernote's "Skitch")

[![](assets/174-2.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aR1pWGEZmkk/U5Dxg96kp7I/AAAAAAABXJA/N5CZrkE4cLY/s1600/%23174+-+iOS.PNG)

  
They are also updating iOS to version 8\. This update also brings a lot of changes:

* Interactive notifications (Android)
* 3rd party keyboards (Android)
* Extendability between 3rd party applications (Android)
* Messages audio/video chat (Snapchat/WhatsApp)
* Photos App with cloud backup and editing (Google+ Photos)
* Hands Free Siri (Moto X Android)
* Widgets in the notification shade (Android)
* Battery usage by app (Android)
* Wifi calling with carrier OK (Skype, LINE, Talkatone, etc)
* HomeKit (AT&T Digital Life, sorta)
* HealthKit (an extension of Fitbit and other such products)

Most impressively, they updated OS X and iOS to function together in a way that far surpasses anything else on the market. They called in "continuity", I'll call it "the biggest innovation since the iPad". Here's changes common to both Operating Systems:  
  
* Spotlight's role and functionality was expanded upon (spotlight previous & Google Search)
* iCloud Drive (Google Drive (Dropbox)
* Airdrop files between iOS & Macs (various wireless transfer apps that never really work well)
* Make your iPhone into a Wireless Hotspot without leaving your computer (various hotspotting apps that never really work well)
* Send and receive SMS & Phone calls from your computer (Google Voice)
  
Lastly, they announced a brand new coding language - "Swift". This is a much bigger deal than any of the above if you are a developer. Here is the main point I'm trying to make in this post: Nothing NOTHING Apple did should really be considered "unlike anything we've ever seen". Everything they put together has a clear bit of prior art. But here's the deal, _it doesn't matter_. They took ideas from Google, Android, Chrome, Google Voice, Snapchat, Dropbox, Evernote, and implemented them in a much more elegant, consumer-friendly manner to their expansive user base. They added even more guns to their already impressive arsenal. More than anything else, Apple has done a really impressive job of pulling together a platform-wide solution for all of your consumer electronics needs. Everything you want to do, you can do on an Apple product while enjoying a consistent design, user-experience, and level of quality. If you were so inclined (and you had the cash) it would be perfectly painless to put together a practical, palatable, playful yet professional, particularly premium, pleasant platform to produce motion pictures, paint portraits, photoshop pictures, play pop pieces, pull up reports, and look at cats on the internet. Apple hit a homerun. They hit a homerun to the tune of this die-hard Android fan seriously thinking. Google I/O (Google's developer conference) is at the end of this month; and they better deliver.   
  
  
Top 5: Things I Used to Point to as Evidence of Android's Superiority

5. Inter-app sharing. Apple has this now. 4\. Customizable homescreens. Apple is still a step below Android in this aspect, but it's much much closer to parity. 3\. Alternative keyboards. Swiping input is so much easier than tapping input. It's just true. Apple's got it now. 2\. Google Now. Apple doesn't really have Google Now. 1\. Hardware variance - namely, screen size. I love my 5 inch phone. The iPhone has a 4 inch display. I just couldn't sacrifice that much screen real estate. Maybe the iPhone 6 will give us something bigger.

Motto: Putting the "I" in "Happiness"

  
I'm going to write a bit about a subject I normally avoid writing about (because I think it's awkward to read about) - my wife.

  
[![](assets/216-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jZt9YLg7jnA/VFhOOF%5FkrdI/AAAAAAABgW8/1PFL9sXamtA/s1600/Gillespie%5F409.jpg)

  
Melissa and I met a little over 5 years ago. Melissa and I got married 6 months ago. We've lived together ever since. It's been a dream. It's been better than I could have hoped for. I knew, intellectually, that living with the love of your life would be a recipe for genuine and continual happiness - but I didn't know what that would _actually feel like_. It's the highlight of my day when I wake up in the morning, to see her there. It's the highlight of my day when we meet again after work. Making dinner, playing games, spending time together, are all **the** highlight of my day. When I go to bed each night, she's there - and it's the highlight of my night. You might notice that my day is pretty much covered in highlighter at this point. That's what it's actually like. She's wonderful. She's beautiful. She's talented. She's happy. She's dedicated. She's a genuine pleasure to be around. I love my wife. If the past half year is any indication of what the next 100 half years will be like, I'm so game. I'm a lucky dude, and I know that.  
  
Feel awkward? Too bad.  
  
Melissa is listening to a piano solo version of "[Where is My Mind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If%5FNgKWJhKs)", which just so happens to be one of my favorite songs. Just wanted to throw that last bit in there for good measure.   
  
Anyway, I said I wasn't going to ONLY write about that, so here's one other thing:  
  
Correction I've been meaning to make: The Nexus 9 does NOT price-match the new iPad Air 2\. The Nexus 9 starts at $399, not $499\. However, that model only comes with 16 GB of storage. When I think of tablets, I think of games. When I think of games, I think of massive usage of storage space. Also, taking movies onto a plane. You'd probably want the $479 32 GB variant. So, in short, I'm a little more impressed with the Nexus 9 now. I still don't plan on buying one - but I'd certainly consider it if I weren't focusing on saving money.

  
Top 5: **Final Thoughts about My Captain America Halloween Costume** 5\. I'm really glad Melissa forced me to do it with her costume choice. Captain America is way more memorable than BoJack Horseman. 4\. I love having the shield. I'm glad I made one instead of buying one. Having said all that, I want to make it better. 3\. I didn't like that my costume consisted of a shield, a mask, some gloves, and then my normal street clothes. The rest of the costume could have been more fledged-out. 2\. I'm not committing to myself anything, but I'd like to try this costume again sometime. With more than a shield, gloves, and a mask. I want a full blown suit. 1\. Captain America is 6 inches shorter than me, but weighs basically the same. In order for me to accurately portray the character I'd probably need to gain 40 lbs and do so in the right places. That's not happening. I'd settle for half that!

Motto: IT'S ALIVE!!!

  
This is a continuation of my previous few Columns. **Re: Linux & video editing** I've determined a new problem regarding Linux and video editing. The better of my two GoPros uses a filesystem type that Linux is incapable of reading. This filesystem type is hardcoded into the GoPro. There is no correction. The workaround is to use my Chromebook and a large flash drive to copy videos from the GoPro to the flash drive and then copy the videos from the flash drive to my Linux machine. It's annoying, but hardly a show-stopper. Glad that I found yet another use for my Chromebook! Overall, I'm very optimistic regarding Linux and video editing, though. Why you ask? I learned Lightworks... kinda. My analogy comparing Lightworks to a weird foreign language with horrible yet strict grammar rules still rings true - but I learned how to speak the sentence that I need to speak. I can take a clip, cut it down to a specific size, insert it into the timeline, and put a title in the corner. Keeping to the analogy, that's the only sentence I know how to say... but I'm getting pretty good at it. The workflow is actually faster than it was on my old editor thanks to some intelligent systeming on the part of Lightworks. After I figured out how to "speak my sentence" in Lightworks, I was able to cut together August 2013 from the new Second-a-day video in a surprisingly short amount of time.

 So I'm feeling super optimistic all the sudden. It's not perfect, there are still nagging issues (framerate problems on individual clips), but I think I have workarounds for all of my problems. **Re: Fitness Baseline** I'm really excited about this idea. Last night I ran three miles. It was slow, I had to walk some, but but I don't care. I completed the full three. I never stopped. I'm not sure I've ever actually run 3 miles before. Here's the rest of the plan: I will measure all metrics over the course of a single week. This will keep things consistent and help keep the samples discrete. By the end of this week I will have data to complete this list - 1 mile time: 3 mile time: 29 minutes, 40 seconds Plank time: Pushup rep number: 34 Pullup rep number: 10 Press weight: 130 Bench weight: Squat weight: 250 Deadlift weight: Yoga... feeling: Okay, not great. Need to work on hip flexibility and balance. Body weight: 224.4 I wish I had something on that list to measure explosiveness or agility. Those things are hard to measure, though. Maybe I'll think of something. Look for a completed fitness baseline sometime this weekend or early next week.  
  
Maybe I should add a "fitness" tag. I don't think tags get used much. Probably because they aren't very useful. Honestly, this whole blog thing could use some TLC. **Re: the rest of life** Things are really great.   
Like, really great.   
Melissa and I are behind on doing some final wedding stuff. We DO have video from the ceremony. We DO have professional photos from the day. We have some sharing to do. In due time.

Some history (if you don't care about history and just want to read about Aaron & the iPhone, skip down to after the next photo in this post):  
  
My very first phone I got sometime around my junior year of high school. It was a flip phone with a VGA camera (in today's terminology, that's 0.3 megapixels). I thought it was so cool. If you took someone's photo with it, you could usually tell who it was! It had ringtones to pick from, you could call your friends on it, or you could text them using the T9 buttons (but who texts?). My first week with the phone it flew out the window of a moving vehicle onto a gravel road. It survived. Having this piece of technology of my very own was EXTREMELY exciting. I started reading about phones and other pieces of consumer technology using my parent's computer on Mozilla Firefox.  
  
After a year and a half, my parents got me my first smartphone - the Motorola Moto Q. It had a huge _320x240_ display and a 1.3 megapixel camera. You could technically install 3rd party software on it, but it was pretty much impossible to do so.  
  
Another year and a half went by. I was about to enter my second year of college when I got my first (and only) Blackberry 8330\. The blackberry was different. The screen was bigger (2.5 inches!). The rollerball was a revolution in user inputs. The keyboard was _great_. I don't want to brag but I did get to the point where I could text blindly under my desk in class without the need to proofread. There were 3rd party applications. I remember I even got one or two, but I don't remember what they were or why you'd want them. At the time, the Blackberry was king of the crop (with the possible exception of the Palm Treo, which I never owned).  
  
Next was the **big** one... the biggest jump from one phone to the next. It didn't happen between the dumb flip phone and the "smart' Moto Q, it happened between my Blackberry and my first Android phone - the Motorola Droid. This was, and maybe still is, my favorite phone I've ever had. It was incredible. It took photos that looked like photos. Its 5MP camera had a flash! It had an internet browser that looked kinda like the actual internet. It had GOOGLE MAPS and GPS! It had a proper headphone jack (RIP). It had a HUGE (3.7") touch screen, AND a slide-out keyboard so I wouldn't have to rely on any finicky on-screen keyboards. People weren't sure how those would play out yet at the time. I distinctly remember when my PlayStation 3 was still new, yet my cousins and I took turns playing with their new phones more than the PlayStation. They were just unlike anything anyone had ever seen before (other than the iPhone, but who could afford an iPhone - they were like $600! for a phone!). This represented a jump in phone technology that I think hasn't really been replicated since, and may never be. Suddenly a phone went from being just a phone to being a phone, a GPS, a camera, a gameboy, a flashlight, and a Google machine.  
  
My 3rd year in college I got the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It had an even bigger, even sharper screen, that was curved somewhat for no reason. It was slightly faster, but otherwise it wasn't much of an upgrade. The hardware was kind of crap, though, even at the time. It felt like you were about to break it constantly. Samsung forced some crapware onto it and permanently gave me a grudge against Samsung.   
  
At Google I/O 2012 Google announced their cheap-but-good LG Nexus 4! I bought it as soon as stock was available. It had a nifty pattern on the back. It had wireless charging (THE FUTURE!). It's camera still sucked by modern standards, but was approaching okay? It was a well-built phone, but was quickly overshadowed by its successor.  
  
The LG Nexus 5 was incredible. It felt like a true step up in a way that the previous two didn't. It had a _massive_ 5 inch screen. It had a no-joke HD (1920x1080) screen. It had an 8MP camera, with (I think?) optical image stabilization. It was fast enough to play some real games. This phone was a legend. It is tied with the next one on this list as my 2nd favorite phone (for the time) I ever owned.  
  
The year after the Nexus 5, Google came out with the Nexus 6... which I didn't buy. It was a full 6-inch screen. It was also 1440p, which was unheard of at the time. I thought it was overkill, and the hardware looked suspect. I just couldn't convince myself to pull the trigger. The Huawei Nexus 6p that came out the next year, however, put me RIGHT back on course. It had everything. It had a bigger screen than my Nexus 5, but wasn't ludicrously wide and awkward like the Nexus 6\. It has USB-C (which I still love). It had stereo front-facing speakers. It had a fingerprint reader. It had Google's first "as good as the iPhone" camera, that still holds up to this day. It had a metal body, which unfortunately meant wireless charging wasn't a thing, but this thing screamed premium... which is good because I didn't see any good reasons to pick up any of Google's next _three years_ worth of phones. The Pixel phones seemed fine, but not overwhelmingly good, and they did away with the cheap pricing. After 3 years with the Nexus 6P, it was starting to hang up, drag in-between tasks, and die after a couple of hours away from a charger. After 1131 days with the Nexus 6P, I decided it was time to upgrade... but there just wasn't any Android phones on the market looked interesting...   

  
[![](assets/356-2.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-%5FZfku8n6urM/W-d1yMl1B2I/AAAAAAADgpc/QuLAbVXv7bASbK-0%5FM6Nj9EN9p9XsGeegCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F0137.jpg)

  
Ever since I saw the all-screen iPhone X in person, I've not been interested in anything with bezels. Several of my friends have that phone, and it got glowing reviews across the board. I saw pictures from its camera that looked genuinely great. Combine that with the apparent aging of my Nexus 6P... and it finally happened. Last Sunday I went Apple. I got an iPhone XS.  
  
I've had it for 6 days now and I'm still getting used to it. It's not interesting to stress things about it that are usually true of all any phones, so I'll do that quickly here: it's crazy fast, its battery is **so** good, its camera is better than any other phone camera I've ever seen, it feels like the future.  
  
I can't go back to bezels. The phone is physically smaller than my old one, but its screen isn't. The notch is not something I notice, nor has it ever been. It reminds me of the "flat tire" on my old Moto 360 watch. It just goes away after looking at the screen for more than 3 seconds.  
  
Apple's "Health" app is so, so much better than the Google Fit app. This was honestly the thing that made me most excited about switching, and I'm not disappointed. The Health app actually gives users a reason to open it, which in turn actually gives developers incentive to use it. Google Fit had integration with food tracking apps, but seeing caloric intake anywhere was basically impossible. I could write an entire Column about my disappointment with Google Fit if I thought anyone in the world other than me would find it interesting. The Health app is great & makes me wish I had an Apple Watch.  
  
Speaking of Health - it is neat that all my historical nutritional data & fitness data pulled over from when I used MyFitnessPal and Strong on Android into the Health app. I didn't start from zero, which made me very happy. Related, but the Life Tracker doesn't work with the Health app in the same way it works with Google Fit. Not yet, at least.  
  
Face ID is a delight. It's basically like not having security on your phone at all. It doesn't feel like you're ever intentionally unlocking it - it just becomes unlocked on its own. The fingerprint was always a very dedicated gesture. I was aware of every time I used it on my old device. It's a known trope that you have to trade security for convenience or convenience for security... but this is the least intrusive security measure I've ever experienced.  
  
The camera is great. The VIDEO camera in particular creates videos that look phenomenal. Every video shot on my Android phones pales in comparison. There was a software stabilization on Android videos that caused the resulting footage to look "jello-y". That hasn't happened on the iPhone yet. Portrait mode and Memojis and the like are neat, for whatever they're worth.  
  
Speaking of pictures - the process of taking a photo & sending it to someone is so, so much faster on iOS than it ever was on Android. I'm not saying that Android's process was complicated, it just always took forever to load the sharing menu. The first time I wanted to send a photo of something I was looking at to someone with my new phone I was blown away by how quickly I accomplished doing it.  
  
Having Garage Band and iMovie on your phone is pretty neat. I haven't done anything with them, but the one thing I like most about Apple is their focus on giving customers a way to be creative. You can make music or edit videos on your iPhone. Even when you take a screenshot you get the option to annotate it, right there. Little things like that are nice!  
  
Going back to wireless charging is nice - although it seems like my wireless charging pad is somewhat spotty. I'll set it down & hear it start to charge, but come back an hour later to find it not charging for whatever reason. It's like it slides off the sweet spot, but nothing moved.  
  
Apps on iOS look better than apps on Android. They look better and the function better. Every single app I've installed on my iPhone that I used to use on my Android devices has been better on the iPhone. LastPass in particular is incredible to use on iOS 12\. It made logging into my various applications almost _fun_. Mint looks better. MyFitnessPal looks better.  
  
My car integrates better with the iPhone. The little readout on the display says what's playing. Also it's nice that every accessory in the world is designed specifically for this phone. That's nice.  
  
Oh, and the phone's compass points north. It's funny how little things like that make a difference. On every Android phone I ever owned functioned like Jack Sparrow's compass.  
  
But not everything is better with an iPhone.  

  
I'm not thrilled to be using lightning cables. For the past year, my phone, laptop, GoPro, Nintendo Switch, and wireless headphones (thanks to an adapter I permanently stuck on there) all could be charged by the same cable. Now if I'm travelling, I need to think about which cable(s) to bring. Plus our cats are addicted to Apple cables specifically and have killed several.  
  
Some apps I bought on Android are way, WAY more expensive on iOS. I bought a weightlifting app called "Strong" on Android for $5\. On iOS, Strong is a subscription-based application that's $5 _each month_. Or you can just buy it for life for $99\. That sucks. Same goes with the #1 sleep analysis apps on each platform. "Sleep as Android" was cheap. The iOS "Sleep Analysis" app is not.  
  
Notifications aren't as easy to manage in iOS. It's weird you have to pull the notification shade ALL the way down before you see if anything is in there. On Android notifications are bottom-aligned as you start to pull down the shade, so you see them immediately. Also the lack of little notification icons at the top of the screen. I often times swipe down my notification shade on my iPhone and am surprised to see there's stuff in there. I've completely missed notifications until after they stopped being relevant. That said, the settings for per-app customization of notifications is a **lot** more clear on iOS than Android.  
  
I do wish I could have a widget on the homescreen with a Google Keep app. Having it off to the side isn't bad, though. Speaking of Google Keep, I find myself shying back to using mostly Google apps. Apple Maps isn't as good as Google Maps (from experience before this), so the fact that the Apple Calendar app links to Apple Maps exclusively means that I won't be using the Apple Calendar app. 

  
The gesture-based UI took a bit of getting used to, but I'm there now. The lack of a "back" button hasn't been an issue. Only one time in my week with iOS have I went "wait, how do I get back to where I just was?". The iPhone will sometimes use the top-left corner to go back. In fact, sometimes you can see the _name_ of what you're going to go back to on it.  
  
The lack of a headphone jack is a bummer. Especially since the aforementioned cats immediately ate the lightning headphones.  
  
The two gripes I just mentioned would have equally applied to Google's new Pixel phones, by the way. They also use gesture-based UIs and lack headphone jacks.  
  
More thoughts will come.  
  
Top 5: Surprising Things I Learned about the iPhone  
5\. Apps that exist on both Android and iOS don't necessarily look or behave the exact same.  
4\. Apple Health can pull in medical records from some places. I can see my prescriptions and stuff as recorded in the past.   
3\. The LastPass integration is crazy good. I already mentioned that, but it was surprising and awesome.  
2\. Apple now lets you uninstall a LOT of the stuff they pre-install. This wasn't always the case.  
1\. The "Measure" app is a thing... and it's crazy. You can take pretty good approximate measurements of stuff in the physical world using your phone's camera.

Motto: **I've got a long way to go**  

  
I re-wrote the HTML template for the Column from scratch. In theory, that should load this post a tiny amount faster. In actuality, it just means that I've learned the _concepts_ of HTML and not just how to copy & paste it. 

  
Of course, when I paste things into this editor box Blogger just decides to make treat every little thing as its own containerized piece of HTML. So my work was for nothing. Stupid Blogger. I'm looking forward to my coming move off Blogger to an actual _website_.

Melissa is in Pasadena, CA. I've learned (and re-leared) a TON of (mostly annoying) things about myself while she's been gone:  
  
* When I cook meals for myself, they usually consist of one course.
   * Yesterday's Breakfast: Cereal.
   * Yesterday's Lunch: One pound of sausage and 4 eggs wrapped in a couple tortillas.
   * Yesterday's Dinner: a pound of baked chicken breast seasoned with Mrs. Dash.
      * _Reminder: Buy more Mrs. Dash Chicken Seasoning._
* I can waste a HUGE amount of time "half doing" two or three things, while actually accomplishing nothing. Usually, while this is going on I've got the sense that I'm forgetting something the whole time... only to realize at the end that I haven't been forgetting anything. or, rather, I forgot that there was nothing to remember.
* I am good at keeping the place organized, but not good at keeping it clean. The apartment right now is a neatly organized cluster of dirty surfaces.
* I have, in fact, seen all the episodes of American Dad and Futurama on Netflix, despite not remembering when I watched them.
* Having a cat on my lap is excuse enough to hold my pee for 20+ minutes.
* I spend too much time in front of screens. I will probably write more on this in another Column soon.
* When I work out, I will stay at the gym for a LONG time if there's no reason to go home. This one is actually a good thing.
* If I only eat when I'm hungry, I don't eat very much at all. My natural state is one of perpetual weight loss.
* This one has nothing to do with Melissa being gone, it's just something I've realized since I took the GRE and written some stuff for work. I am and have for a long time been having a real problem with brevity that I could really stand to make some marked improvements on. Often I will find myself saying tons of unnecessary words just to say the couple of words that I actually wanted to say. For example, let me rewrite everything I just accomplished saying:
   * I could be more concise.
      * Taa-daa!
* I am not good at being social. I am not saying I am bad in social situations... I'm saying I'm bad at putting myself in them. Despite living only minutes from several, I have made zero attempt to see friends since Melissa left.
* I sleep at a 45 degree angle across my bed.
* If left to my own devices, I let my mood guide my actions instead of the other way around.
  
  
That's about it for now. I hope this was entertaining.

  
Top 5: Things I Accomplished in the Last Week

5\. Caught up on my 3rd Second-a-Day video

Motto: Dr. Jan Itor

  
Follow through... follow through is the topic I want to talk about for this Column.

  
Actually let's talk about something else.

  
It goes without saying at this point that I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movies are entertaining across the board, with some really great standout characters, moments, scenes, and laughs. The television shows have been entertaining on the whole, with some shining examples of great writing. The Netflix shows have been great. Most impressive of all, the organization of the whole lot has been nothing short of phenomenal.

  
But.

  
It's not perfect. There are a few things I wish were different. I wrote some stuff that used to be right here, but you'll see it later in the Top 5.

  
February is almost up, which means I'm nearing the end of my CostCo 30 Day Challenge. The basic idea was that I was going to only eat food I got from CostCo. What I hoped to accomplish from this was 4 fold:  
  
1. Force myself to meal prep in bulk
2. Force myself to stop eating out
3. Force myself to get creative with at-home cooking
4. See how much money I would save
  
Even though we're still 4 days from the end of the month, I'm pretty sure I know the takeaways...   
  
**The Bad:**  
* I made a couple of purchases I regretted, but had to live with for a while because they were BULK purchases
* I didn't meal prep in bulk _much_ more than I would have anyways
* I didn't even wholly restrict my grocery shopping to CostCo

**The Good:**
  
  
* I DID do a good job of not eating out (as much)

**The Meh:**

* I can't really tell how much, if any, money doing this saved me

The data from February contain too many confounding variables. Even after doing my best to strip out some of the noise and account for things that obviously should be accounted for (e.g. the $360 CostCo trip in late January that carried well into February), it looks like I saved less than $100, if anything at all. I expected much more dramatic results.

  
I guess you live and you learn. That's the point of these things, right?

  
30 Day Challenges are essentially just me listing out things I want to do better at and trying them one at a time. Draw more. Eat out less. Exercise more often and with more variety. Use technology less. Go new places and try new things. They are cliched goals, but just because they are "basic" doesn't mean they are less worthwhile. Pumpkin Spice lattes are good. So what.  
  
MARCH'S 30 DAY CHALLENGE: something related to exercise. My body has been trying to bring me down for the past 3 months. I'll get it nailed down before March 1st.  

  
Photo to go out on - maybe be the best selfie I've ever taken.

Top 5: Low Points of the MCU

5\. **Black Widow & Bruce Banner's love plot** \- this really came out of left field. I don't hate it, persay. It had been set up for a while that Black Widow and Hawkeye might be a thing, but I like what the did with Hawkeye's farm & family life even better than going forward with that. I don't even hate that Black Widow and Bruce Banner _could_ be a thing... it was just done really suddenly. It felt like we jumped into the middle of a relationship without seeing it set up. Also, I liked having a female character who wasn't anyone's love interest. That's gone now.  
4\. **Iron Man 3 & the Mandarin** \- most people will say the Mandarin should have been the actual Mandarin. Ben Kingsley was wasted on Trevor Slattory and a story involving the real Mandarin would have been better. I didn't actually hate this twist. I put it the list here because I know this is a popular opinion.  
3\. **Iron Man 3 Ending** \- MY opinion this time... Pepper Potts should have died. She fell to a fiery death near the end of the movie. Five minutes later, there's a scene obviously tacked onto what should have been the ending of the movie that completely ruins it. Tony's satisfying defeat of the villain is negated entirely by him surviving what should definitely have killed him, spouting off a way-too-on-the-nose bit of dialog, Pepper miraculously surviving what should definitely have killed her, then killing the bad guy by kicking some random explosive thing that happened to be on the ground and shooting it with a Iron Man's repulsor. This is out of character, for one. It undercuts all consequence of the story and any lessons Tony learned in the story. It robs us of any long-lasting weight... and we haven't even seen Pepper since this anyways! She should have stayed dead.  
2\. **Agent Carter Season 2** \- basically the whole thing. They turned strong Peggy Carter into a little girl with a crush on two boys. The big bad had a murky at best motivation. The season finale was centered around a plan in which they lured the supposed super genius Madam Masque out to walk in front of a huge, trailer-sized gun in the middle of the street, hoping she'll just walk in front of it. Worst yes, that's exactly what happens. Then there's a season-ending cliffhanger that will never be resolved because the series was not renewed. Agent Carter should have been ONE season - and that season should have just been an expansion of the pre-existing Agent Carter one-shot... which is not canon now? Ugh.  
1\. **Marvel's villain problem** \- Iron Monger, the Abomination, Whiplash, Red Skull, Killian Aldrich, Malekith, Alexander Pierce, Ronan the Accuser, the Yellowjacket, and the no-name villain from Doctor Strange (Kaecilius) what do they have in common? They were all underdeveloped, given poor motivations, and killed off/sent away & unlikely to return. Their motivations range from "went crazy just cause" to "want to destroy the universe just case". At _best_ they are just "I don't like you because I'm Hydra", which I guess works. Loki and The Winter Soldier have really been the only two villains worth remembering - I literally forgot to write Ultron in the list up there, and you didn't even notice. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT! Ultron is such a great character!

# Celebrating History

April 22nd, 2013 was seven years ago. It was the first day I committed to using a point-tracking system to better manage my life. It was based on an idea I stole from a Demetri Martin stand up special. In that special Demetri talked about how he used his points system for **26 weeks**. It was my goal at the time to do it for 5, or maybe 10 weeks. That seemed like a daunting commitment.

I just finished week number *three hundred sixty five*[^1].

My tracking system has grown and changed alongside me. I went from a guy living by himself with a girlfriend who was *very* far away to being married to said girl, going through a series of apartments, getting some cats, switching careers, buying a couple cars, buy our first house together, and becoming parents[^2].

It was originally managed via pieces of paper I carried around, and a once-weekly Excel data entry task. Then I moved to Google Sheets. Then I moved to Google Forms. More recently, I moved to a custom web app I built. I used to care very much about the points system. Slowly, its value as a free-flowing journal overcame its value as a rigid framework of points-tracking. Now I’m thinking of going back to a variation on the point system idea.

It taught me how to use spreadsheets. It gave me a reason to get good at them. Once I got a little good, I wanted to get *really* good. It gave me a reason to learn how to write code. It gave me a place to experiment with how code and spreadsheets can interact, then how they could interact *better*. Later I found out just how far being good at spreadsheets and coding can take your career. 

I’m not saying the Data Journal is to thank for my successes. I can never know what lay on the paths not taken. What I am saying is that I’m glad it’s been a consistent part of my life for the past seven years *because* of its part in putting me specifically on **this** path. For that, I’m incredibly grateful. 

## The Original System

This was the original points system. A heavy majority of these 25 daily goals lasted, unchanged, for 5 years.

![[391-1.png]]

I’ve written about history of the Data Journal many times over. I won’t write much more about it 

# Continuing Forward

I’ve learned an *incredible* amount thanks to this project - not only about myself (which was the intended goal), and not only about spreadsheets & coding (the next most obvious reward), but also about how to organize information and orchestrate life through time. 

For years I thought this sort of personal information system had to be self-contained. Its value was limited by what I could spiderweb into its rows and columns. Weirdly, the actual *spreadsheet* portion of the whole thing has grown less and less important. For example - I have spent, collectively, probably 20+ hours messing around with how to better integrate my personal finance app 'Mint' into the spreadsheet, alongside everything else. I thought it needed to be integrated, or it wouldn’t have any value. I wouldn’t be able to review its data. It may as well not even exist.

Sometime within the last year it dawned on me. It doesn’t *really* matter that all your data be centralized into one place. It doesn’t *have* to be in a single spreadsheet for you to access it, engage with it, and utilize it on a frequent basis. I can just *go look in Mint*. Really, it’s okay. The same could be said for the apps I use to manage all sorts of other things (e.g. diet, exercise, time & habit trackers). The only real benefits of integration is the ability to search one repository for a litany of different things and the ability find correlations. In my experience, though, I’d rather search Mint for transactional data, or MyFitnessPal if I need to know what I ate (which doesn't happen). I didn’t find anything useful in the correlation study that wasn’t already obvious (and believe me, I tried).

What matters more than integration is **engagement**. I was heavily engaged in one specific silo of information. That was why it was so appealing to make the silo wider. But there is no reason you can’t engage with data where they already live. With that dawning realization, the importance of my Data Journal shifted from being the one place to house everything, to being the one place to house *specifically those things that aren’t well-covered elsewhere*. 

## Data Journal, Data Manifest, and Periodic Review Checklists

The Data Journal is now a component of a larger, more useful system with a lower barrier to entry. The schema of the database dictated what got measured and managed. The columns functioned as a script for periodic reviews. If I couldn't force something into the schema, I couldn't track it and it wasn't reviewed. An example of one such problem child was my calendar. There *are* ways to pull your calendar into a spreadsheet, but it really doesn't belong there.

![[391-2.png]]

By breaking out the schema and the script, suddenly I'm capable of managing and organizing a much broader scope... and doing so with less effort (or at least less overhead).

The schema used to be defined by the layout of columns in a spreadsheet. The schema is now defined in my Data Manifest. [See this post for more](https://aarongilly.com/385).

The script used be “look at what’s in your summary sheet” for each week, month, and year. Now the script is defined in a note, linked to by a recurring task in my task manager. It can grow, shrink, and evolve as needed through time. More importantly, it isn’t limited to what’s in a spreadsheet.

## The Future

The big question I‘m pondering now is how I want to develop, grow, and share these ideas. I’m interested in developing an app, but every component of the system is already well-covered by apps. The whole concept of a distributed productivity and tracking system is antithetical to the creation of a “one app for everything” solution. Or maybe there’s some niche or corner that isn’t particularly well-served? 

Alternatively, I could write a book? Or make a YouTube series? Or host a Podcast? Or just settle for having the ideas strung out on an obscure blog through a number of posts over time (a.k.a. What I’m doing now). 

Time will tell.

# Top 5: Facts from Seven Years Tracked
1. 35 of the first 114 weeks were actually NOT tracked. Before I switched to a nightly input, if I lost the sheet of paper I was using to keep track of my week, it was a lost week. This is a 10% miss rate over the course of 7 years. Since the switch to the nightly input 4.8 years ago, I haven't missed a day.

![[391-3.png]]

2. I'm on major version **8** of the Tracker. That's about 1 major change a year. I defined 'major changes' as the addition or subtraction of significant number of (~more than 2) columns.
3. I track food slightly over half the time. This has dropped sharply since 2020. I stopped tracking what I ate when I realized that I genuinely don't need to. Over the past twelve months I've gotten thinner, fitter, and ate better than ever before. I'll start tracking food again if I wake up one day and don't have >4 visible abs.
4. I've logged 794 workouts in the 2300 days (hey another round number, neat) I successfully tracked. That's 1 workout every 2.9 days on average for 7 years. That's 2.4 workouts/week. I'd like to see that number closer to 3.
5. If I could do it all over again, I'd change very little.

Motto: We're Going Through Changes

  
One week ago was 2/1/2014, my half birthday. In the week since, some intense snow has given me the opportunity to sit down and put together the first half of the video that will eventually be "My 25th Year".

  
Because I can't think of a better title, I now present to you - "From 25.0 to 25.5":
  
  
So, that's that.

  
I have two other things to share with you today, though.

  
After having it on my list of goals for probably half a year, I finally sat down and made a complete **Life Reference** using a highly portable, open-source encryption method. I no longer will be without the extremely important private personal information. The list contains (among other things) a list of account names and passwords, a list of policy or account numbers, a list of phone numbers for insurance or financial agencies, a list of my most valuable personal possessions, and living, education, medical, and employment histories.

  
It's pretty boss.

  
Lastly, my **30 Day Challenge** for this month is going to have to change.   
  
As it turns out, "No screens after 9pm" takes a bit more planning and foresight than we originally thought. Melissa and I have broken that rule more often than not over the past 8 days. Now, while that _might_ seem sad and pathetic, it's actually been because of our wild productivity.  
  
In the past 8 days:  
1\. We made, largely from scratch, our wedding invitations, RSVPs, and all that stuff.  
2\. We've put together a website (blog) for the wedding.   
3\. We've collaborated on my Life Reference project.   
4\. We (well, _I_) have read 2/3rds of an e-book.  
5\. I put together the video featured earlier.  
  
It seemed silly to _stop_ working on these really important, huge goals in the name of a smaller, 30 day goal. Rather than give up on doing a 30 day challenge this month, we are going to attempt to **read 5 books this month**.   
  
I'm 2/3rds the way through Dan Brown's "Inferno" (the 4th book of the series that started with "The Da Vinci Code"). While it's not entirely _original_, it's still highly entertaining. Next up, a book about happy marriages that our officiant wants us to read. After that: Who knows. All I know is, I've gotta go so I can get some reading done.  
  
The picture to go out on is a random pick from my surprisingly long list of "Pictures to eventually feature in the Column":

Careful, it's cold out there.  

Top 5: Words I've Learned Thanks to Books

5\. Luddite - a person who fears that a machine will take his job  
4\. Oculus - a round (or eyelike) opening or design  
3\. I haven't been keeping track of words very well and just realized I forgot to mention in the column up there that I hurt my shoulder playing basketball. I should be fine, but I'm going to have to take it easy for a while.  
2\. Avarice - extreme greed for wealth  
1\. Dilettante - a person who essentially fakes an interest or expertise in a given area

Motto: Set Achievable Daily Goals and Achieve Them Daily  
  
I've struggled not to start every Column I've written over the past few months with "everything is really good". I didn't write it because it isn't all that interesting to read, but today's post is mostly about how and why I think things are so good for me lately.  
  
Routine, the thing that i had heard about as the chief complaint of relationships in televised sitcoms, has turned out to be not something I'm afraid of, but instead something I am actively interested in cultivating. It is the primary subject I am going to write about today; so strap in or bail out now.  
  
Routine has several definitions:  
* ["Commonplace tasks, chores, or duties as must be done regularly or at specified intervals"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/routine)
* ["A set of customary or unchanging and often mechanically performed activities or procedures"](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/routine)
* ["A regular way of doing things in a particular order"](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/routine)
* ["A boring state or situation in which things are always done the same way"](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/routine)

Those are all accurate and fine definitions of routine, but I'd prefer just to say that routine is life. You sleep at night. You eat two or three times a day. You wash and dry your clothes when they are sufficiently dirty. Those are routines and they make sense. If you skipped out on any of of those things on a long enough timeline, you'd find yourself in trouble (either dead or smelly), so you do those things. But those aren't the only routines we have. Each of us have hundreds of things (on a macroscopic and microscopic scale) that we do as routines.

  
Unlock the car with keyless entry on approach. Engage handle with convenient hand. Look inside car to determine if debris needs shifting or cleaning before you and your current cargo may enter. Place right foot on floorboard and use hand(s) on your preferred surface(s) to stabilize yourself on entry. Sit in seat. Bring other foot inside of the vehicle, ensuring it and all other items are clear from the path of the door. Close the door. Engage ignition mechanism with the right hand.

  
That's a _lot_ of stuff, yet we all do it every time. We don't think about it; we just do it. But that wasn't always the case. There was a "first time", a time _before_ we established the routine. The routine was arrived at through trial and error. Now that you have a routine, you're a car entering fool. Don't even have to think about it (you stud).

  
The car entry example is a microscopic routine that everyone has got figured out... but it would be easy to go through life without looking at your bigger routines. That is a potentially dangerous (or, at the very least, inefficient) way of doing things. If you don't stop to consider what you're doing on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, or even year-to-year basis, you will end up in a "_how did I get here?_" situation. 

  
There's another definition of "routine" that I like:

* "[**performed as part of a regular procedure rather than for a special reason**](https://www.google.com/search?q=digitize&rlz=1CATAAA%5FenUS594US596&oq=digitize&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2621j1j7&sourceid=chrome&es%5Fsm=93&ie=UTF-8#q=define+routine)"

  
This is really the crux of argument I'm making. Doing things because that's just what you do, rather than finding a special reason to do everything. If you only go to the gym on special occasions, you won't go to the gym very often. If you aren't intentional with how you're filling out your days, they will be filled with _whatever_... and whatever just isn't very ambitious.  
  
A good routine covers all the bases, while leaving room for flexibility. It doesn't take up 100% of your day, 7 days a week. It is also not a one-size-fits all type of solution.  
  
I've been in my new job for a couple of months now. I'm fairly settled as far as timing goes. I know when I'll be there, when I won't be; and with this knowledge I've carved out a pretty great (for me) routine.  
  
**My Routine (Mon-Fri):**

* Morning
   * Wake.
   * Start coffee.
   * Make & eat breakfast (whatever variety is fine).
   * Get dressed.
   * Pack pre-made lunch into lunch box.
   * Finish coffee & make protein drink (water + whey powder).
   * Drive to work, listening to a podcast (whichever podcast is cool).
   * Drink whole coffee on commute.
* Work
   * Drink protein drink.
   * Rinse and refill with straight water.
   * Drink. Refill. Continue to lunch as needed.
   * Lunch: Refill with water, add caffeinated crystal light.
   * Eat lunch you brought in, unless there's a better option.
   * Rinse and refill with straight water.
   * Continue until end of workday.
* After work
   * Workout: MWF - lift weights, TuTh - basketball (after basketball season this will be readjusted).
   * Drive home, listening to a podcast or talking with someone on the phone using my car's phone integration.
   * At home, shower.
   * Make dinner - starting with the question "[what is the _base_ of this meal going to be](http://ss.fitness/#ssf-make-a-meal)?", following up with appropriate followups.
   * Eat dinner.
   * Clean dinner & put away work stuff + whatever other junk has accumulated.
   * Spend the remaining 1-3 hours doing whatever.
   * Brush & floss.
   * Get in bed.
   * Start sleep tracker Android app, close eyes. Dream of electric sheep.
* Repeat.

**My Routine (Sat):**

* (This section intentionally blank)
**My Routine (Sun):**

  
* Every-other Sunday, beat Ben at pool.
* Deep clean the place (the depth may vary from week to week)
* Create some form of bulk meal for the first couple of lunches for Melissa and I.

Writing it out like that makes it sound formal, like I've got a checklist that I carry around and check things off as I go - but that's not true. Just like the car entry example before, it's just what happens. It's not rigid. It's not without exception. It's just generally what I try to do. If I manage to do it more often than not, I wind up feeling pretty good about things. It makes me happy now and hopefully will enable happiness in the long term. Happiness is what we're all going for, right?  
  
Some people might read that and think "wow that sounds incredible boring". To those people: Shut up. Go away. Like your life is so interesting.  
  
But really, Saturdays are always different. I try to fill out each night with different stuff. I try to make new meals. I've got vacation hours. If "routine" is a boring concept for you, then I would say you have a boring routine.  
  
This Column doesn't necessarily lend itself to a picture to go out on - but this picture I took of the best made-from-scratch meal I've ever prepared seems to be a good idea. This thing was packed with protein (and flavor!).

Top 5: Additions I'd like to make to the routine, but haven't yet had the discipline for  
5\. Catch up on my "me" projects (Columns, Second-A-Day Videos, Life Tracking)   
4\. Have an established time which is dedicated for learning stuff - the stuff rotating on a weekly basis (learning music, coding stuff, etc)  
3\. Read before bed every night  
2\. Meal prep Sundays - make all lunches for the entire week  
1\. Before-work workouts

# Motto: WVZ7X7

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE! This whole idea was dumb and didn't stick. Go ahead and skip all this. END THE EDITOR'S NOTE.

The motto is my new thing - my unique identifier in the space of 6 character strings. You can Google "WVZ7X7" and find this page without (much) clutter. For now, I won't make any grandiose changes to the column to accommodate the string. I'm just going to add it in a little text box above my picture at the top-right of the page (or the top of the very bottom of the mobile page). 

If you have a hard time remembering "WVZ7X7", it may help to notice how the whole string can be drawn without picking up your pencil - like so:

![](assets/111-1.png).png)

I used Microsoft Paint to make that. You could probably tell by its fanciness. 

I also made a few other variations of the same thing:

Then I started getting fancy with coloration:

Then I graduated from Paint and started getting really fancy:

Anyway, that's not the only thing I wanted to share it today's column. It's not the only thing I've made lately, either. I made an graphic to illustrate a point that I've made to many people over the past several years. I'd explain more, but I think I'd rather just let the graphic do the talking:

The last thing I wanted to mention in today's post was the story a friend of my friend told me. She was at her place of employment, eavesdropping on a conversation between two coworkers about the correct pronunciation of '.gif'. One of the guys referenced "that guy with the peanut butter" when making his argument.

That guy was me, back from over a year ago when I did this:

If that's not 'infamy', then I don't know what is.

Motto: Don't say cheese, just smile. Life is Good. 

  
This is the kind of stuff I think about.

  
What is "smart"? What makes somebody smart? Is it just... knowing a lot of things? Is somebody _smart_ just because they do really well in bar trivia? Are you smart because you've read so many books? Is she smart because she's so well-traveled? Is he smart because he's experienced a lot of things?

  
I don't think "smart" is definable in a global scope. It's sort of like "healthy". It doesn't _mean_ anything, really. Healthy is what you define it to be. If you die of a heart attack at 35, but that was your plan all along - does that make you "unhealthy"? Planning to die at 35 certainly makes you not _smart_... so what does? Maybe "smartness" is something you just know when you see it, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. 

  
I'm not "smart" because I pulled that sweet Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart reference. I had to Google 'who said that thing about "I know it when I see it"'... but just because I had to _Google_ it - does that take away that I said it? Is smartness just having the ability to produce results?

  
A smart person would probably know.

A smarter person would probably say "[don't think about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItV8utelYlc)".

  
Along a similar vein - have you ever considered the difference between _actually_ learning something vs just "learning the sequence of words that explains the thing"? I think my college education was very much centered around "learning a sequence of maths that does a thing" and NOT about the real-world applications that would invoke those maths.

  
I can _read_ about how to accomplish X or Y in Java on Android - but until I apply X or Y to solve a real-world problem, it's somewhat meaningless. Breaking code into functions seemed like a completely meaningless set of steps to take when I could just write that same code directly into the main body of whatever. Today the concept of _not_ containerizing code just seems... brutish and messy.

  
And now for something completely different.

  
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best videogames I've ever played. I watched my brother-in-law play some of it over the weekend and I was reminded just how delightful the experience was.

  
And now for something _else_ completely different.

  
I want to expand upon [something I wrote about almost two years ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/291)...  

  
_I feel like many of the major problems people have in their lives that they've struggled to control have well-known, simple, yet extremely unsexy solutions._  
  
Weight management, financial management, how to wake up feeling rested, how to stay on top of tasks - these are solved problems. **Not** implementing the tried-and-true solutions to problems you're having is a matter of lack of discipline. I think that part of the problem is the [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic%5Ftreadmill) and a tendency for each of us to return to the status quo in a more general sense. You do a thing. It makes you happy for a while, until it doesn't. Then you stop doing the thing even though you know it's good for you.   
  
I think that it's hard to change behaviors and attitudes without changing environments. Once you've established a pattern of behavior in a given place, that's just sort of how you are there. I go to my parents house and I'm instantly high school Aaron again.  
  
I'd like to sit down high school Aaron and show him the Top 10 from below... although I don't think it would have much effect.  I'm not saying that I have these problems solved, I saying I can describe how one _would_ solve them.   
_**T**_ _**hat's**_ the difference between learning the sequence of English words that explain a thing versus actually learning the thing.  
  
Alright that's all I had, I've gotta go have a good evening.

Top 10: Simple Solutions to Life's Big Problems

10\. If you're having trouble with money, make a budget. There's a billion tools and techniques. They all achieve the same thing. Follow the budget. For more money stuff, see [this notecard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FIndex%5FCard).

9\. Talk to people around you. Talk about your problems. Talk about their problems. Talk about the weather. If you're unhappy, talk to a therapist.

8\. Regardless of your religion, at least 6 or 7 of Christianity's 10 Commandments are no-brainers. Do those things. I'm sure there's some super obvious stuff included in other religions that I'm not aware of

7\. If you have tasks, write them down someplace you'll see them. If you have an appointment, put it in a calendar. If your tasks need to be done by a certain time, put them in that calendar, too. If you don't have a calendar, your phone is a more than capable of covering this.

6\. Have a place for everything, and put everything in its place.

5\. If you're drinking something that's not water, have a reason. Drink water almost exclusively.  
4\. Don't smoke. If you're a smoker and you want to stop. Don't buy cigarettes. I contend that if you're addicted to thing, _having_ the thing is going to prevent you from getting over that addiction. If you're a smoker, why? Seriously why? That's maybe a different topic, but how could you possibly have gotten yourself into that situation? How D.A.R.E. you.

3\. Lift weights, do cardio, and stretch. There's a million exercise routines, but the basics cover basically everything. If you are going to become a bodybuilder, physique model, or high-level athlete then you'll know what else you need to do. If you're not those things, then you don't need to do much else.  
2\. Sleep consistent hours. Don't hit snooze. Avoid screens for an hour before bed, and definitely while _in_ bed.  
1\. Delete Facebook. Hit the gym. Lawyer up.

Motto: I have half an hour to write this  
  
It's the beginning of the month. That means I'm transitioning between two 30 Day Challenges. Here's where I reflect on my previous month and set a new goal:  
  
Last month's challenge - **Sweat 5 Days a Week**  
Results - Glorious failure... sweat barely over 3 days/week in reality  
Reflection - Disappointment with self  
  
This month's goal: **No screens after 10PM**  
**I am going to do this.** I have only really had 2 "good" months out of the first 10 months of 2015 in terms of successful challenge completion. That's terrible. Here's to turning it around.  
Having said that, this month's challenge might be particularly challenging because I GOT THE NEXUS 6P TODAY! It's gorgeous. It's wonderful. My Nexus 5 went from "meh" to "AGGGH GET IT AWAY FROM ME IT'S HIDEOUS" in 5 seconds. The screen quality alone is reason enough to switch. See the Top 5 for more.  
  
Here are some relevant pictures:

The Royals won the World Series yesterday. I literally thought I'd never see that happen. It was too dark out to see the all the pigs flying.  
  
I've seen all 4 of my groomsmen from my wedding within the past week after not seeing any of them for several months. I prefer seeing them over not seeing them. I prefer friends over not friends in general, actually. Life lessons.  
  
Alright. 5 minutes to spare. I gotta go play with my new phone for 4 minutes really quickly!  
  
Top 5: Things I Immediately Appreciate about My New Phone  
5\. The metal build. The weight. They beauty. The Nexus 5 was never an "ugly" phone, but it's hard to deny that the Nexus 6 is a looker. It feels _premium_. I like it.  
4\. The fingerprint sensor. Although my phone is hardly ever actually _locked_ on account of me using a smartwatch and Android's nifty "Trusted bluetooth connections" feature... the integration with Lastpass alone is worth the fingerprint being on this list. It's saved me from typing in my 20+ character-long password probably a dozen times today. It's a revelation.  
3\. The speakers are on the FRONT of the phone... and they are GOOD. It actually will take some getting used to. I'm not used to hearing my notification sound so well. I had a speaker phone call today, it was a night-and-day type difference compared to the Nexus 5 of yore.  
2\. The screen. Oh my goodness the screen. It's 5.7 inches of gorgeousness. What makes it gorgeous is NOT the 1440p part of the screen, it's the AMOLED screen type (as compared to most phones' LCD screens). It's colors are amazing. It's big, beautiful, bright, and handles contrast way better than LCD ever could.  
1\. The camera doesn't take 15+ seconds to open up, find a focus, and take a picture. Beyond that, it's pictures don't look like they were taken through a light layer of fog. It's also helps that I get to see the pictures it takes so much better thanks to #2 above.

Motto: Do You Have Any Apple Fritters?  
  
I read an article ([like this one](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/200905/if-you-want-succeed-don-t-tell-anyone) about a psychology study in which the takeaway was: telling somebody you were going to achieve a goal, made you less likely to achieve that goal. I thought "I should stop telling people I'm going to do things before I do them!" Then I promptly pulled open my messaging app and typed a message to my wife saying:   
_"I think I'm going to stop telling you about things I want to do to better myself befo"_...  
  
Then I realized the irony of the message, and pressed 'delete' instead of 'send'.  
  
I say it here because I thought it was funny.  
  
You ever make a table like this?

If you haven't, maybe think about doing it.   
  
Or don't. I expected it to be more enlightening than it was.  
  
I have a Podcast. It's got [a website](https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co/) in case you're not interested in Podcast apps... it's nothing fancy. Just a thing we do for fun.  
  
Top 5: Things I Learned About Communication at Work  
5\. ... I only have 4 points to make. This is me copping out.  
4\. It is incredibly rare to communicate too much or too clearly.   
3\. Pay attention to what means of communication works best for given situations. Use those for similar situations. A lot of times a 20 minute chat can be done in a 3 minute phone call... and other times a 3 minute phone call can be done in a 5 second chat.  
2\. The word "but" is almost never worth saying. "And" works in it's place AND doesn't make it sound like you weren't lying about whatever you said before it.  
1\. Don't say "just" in an email. Stuff like "I just wanted to say..." makes it sound like you're not worth their time.

Motto: Optimis Divisible Only by Himself and One

  
The thirty day challenge I embarked upon for the month of November was simple - live on a budget. I wanted to see if some pre-determeined amount of money was enough to sustain a comfortable life for Melissa and I. We completed that challenge successfully. That, however, was largely because I put off making any larger purchases until THIS month... which hardly seems like it should count. So, "success" I guess? Maybe, more aptly put as "Success\*". Because this is really the only venue I keep track of these things, I'm going to do a hyperbrief rundown of each month's challenge & its outcome: January - Paleo & Crossfit - Success February - Read 5 Books - Failure March - Write Every Day - Success April - Run 50 Miles - Failure May - Enjoy Yourself - Success June - A GoPro a Day - Successful July - Adopt Linux, Duolingo - Huge success, partial success August - No Reddit, Buy a Car, Other Stuff - Success, failures September - Yes Man - Success October - The Incredible Bulk - Success November - Live on a Budget - Success I don't like breaking those down into binary "success" and "failure". Almost every month feels like it deserves an adjective like "huge", or "partial".   
So, what about December?   
  
Well, I'm not doing anything different in my _personal_ life for December. Instead, I've decided to try out an entirely new workflow at work. Without getting into the boring nitty-gritty details I will be utilizing Outlook, OneNote, and a tag-based system instead of a folder-based system. The one true categorization will be time. Each day and each week will be easily searchable. What happened on any given day will be readily apparent. It seems like timelines could much more useful in the business world than a per-project folder structure.  
  
I've got another Column lined up, ready to submit. I will wait until tomorrow to push it out, though.   
  
I'll end this post with this picture - no context provided.

Motto: Your Projected Projects Project Your Identity

  
Writing this in a coffee shop. I'm so hipster\*.

  
\*according to Jon, who lived in Seattle and thus _knows_ "hipster".

  
Melissa and I found a new place, as my last post said. We move in 20 days from now... but you wouldn't guess that was the timeframe by looking at our current place. Melissa packed up 50% of our place already. It's impressive.  
  
I wrote this Column _mostly_ just to write down my Top 5.  
  
**My Nexus 5 died.** The hardware power button was going bad on me starting around a month ago. 3 days ago it stopped working all together. I pulled the phone apart, unscrewed all the screws, unclipped the electrical connections, pulled out the circuit board, cleaned out the electrical component power button, and put everything back together. Then it booted up and ran fine. It was a cool experience. So **it's working now\***, but I'll still be in the market for a phone again pretty soon.  
  
\*except for the wireless charging and NFC, which I cannot seem to get working.   
  
My Life Tracker thing continues to get cooler. I used this formula in a column of cells:  
  
\=SUM(COUNTIFS(Daily!$D:$D,$B3,Daily!Q:Q,">0.5")\*IFERROR(AVERAGEIFS(Daily!Q:Q,Daily!$D:$D,$B3,Daily!Q:Q,">0.5"),0),COUNTIFS(Daily!$D:$D,$B3,Daily!Q:Q,"<0.5")\*IFERROR(AVERAGEIFS(Daily!Q:Q,Daily!$D:$D,$B3,Daily!Q:Q,"<0.5")+1,0)/COUNTIFS(Daily!$D:$D,$B3)  
  
Here are some new insights I've found from the updates I just made to the "yearly" summaries - compared to 2014, in 2015 I...  
  
* Sleep 12 minutes less on average
* Am 11% more likely to workout on any given day
* Take 192 more steps per day
* Weigh 1 pound less (this calculation can be done as simply as "what I weigh now minus what I weighed then", but this was done in a hilariously complicated way)
* Eat 23 more grams of protein (the equivalent of 1/5 lb chicken breast)
* Am less productive by an average of about 1 goal/day (of the 25 total possible)

Anyway. I'm really happy with the thing. I'm still interested in making it into an app. Turns out that's difficult. I'll give it another go someday soonish.

  
Completely unrelated picture to go out on - Melissa says "TWO THORS!"

Top 5: Coming "30 Day Challenges"

5\. Sleep 8 hours a night. No ifs, ands, or buts. Go to bed early. Wake up 8 hours later.  
4\. Try the iPhone for a month. I'm not sure I _can_ do this one, but if it's possible it would be fun to try. I'm in the market for a new phone soon anyway. If I can return an iPhone within 30 days of purchase, I'd like to give it a shot for a month.  
3\. IIFYM diet. I've been wanting to do this one for forever. I might combine it with some sort of workout challenge focusing on overall fitness.  
2\. Go to _only_ to new places. Don't walk into any business you've ever been to before. Eat at new places. Shop at new stores. I'm thinking about doing this one next month (during the move).   
1\. Use the amenities **every day** (at our new place). Looking to do this one in April after we've settled into our new place. The amenities look super nice, but they only do you good if you use them.

Motto: This is essentially just Facebook  
  
My little family unit just took our first 3-person vacation... and we liked it so much we decided to go for immediate seconds.  
  
We spent 3 days, 4 nights in lovely lovely Las Vegas - in a way super holy cow nice house with a way super holy cow nice family. We saw the Strip, where we ran into a pair of old friends from a cruise. We met up with the Best Man. We hung out by the pool and drank delicious beverages and ate ice cream like we were kids. We _were_ kids, and it was super nice. The kind of nice that makes you realize you’re doing things right in this world.  
On what was scheduled to be our last full day of the trip, we decided to change our flight home. Rather than leaving from Vegas, we would leave from San Diego. Then we rented a car to get down there. Driving they the Mojave Desert listening to the score from the movie Rango was super fun.  
  
Turns out it’s cold in San Diego. If you’re packed for 100 degree Vegas, you may not be perfectly suited to go to 69 degree San Diego. That said, it was San Diego. The weather goes from “on the colder side of really nice” to “on the warmer side of really nice.” We had a chilly day on the beach, an awesome day at the worlds best Zoo, and a cathartic “last day of it all” day by the pool in the hotel.  
Overall, 9.75/10\. Maybe pack and a long sleeve shirt just in case. Oh and don’t actively have fevers for the first 2 full days of your vacation.  
  
  
I could picture myself living in the southwest at some point in the future. Or not. Who knows? I wrote this whole post on my phone in a plane, so don't judge me.  
  
I wanted to also write my lament about Google Keep and how it represents the nexus between so many things I love, yet I cannot find a way to incorporate it into my life in a satisfactory way. That can be another day. Or never.  
  
Top 5: Pictures from the Trip  
5\.

**Note:**  
I'm blaming my illness for the first few days of the vacation for the fact that I don't have a photo of us with our hosts, the Fullers. They deserve to be in 2.5 of these photos at a minimum. I'm sure they are devastated and this little footnote is the least I can do.

Motto: Grass.RGB(0,0,255)

  
I am in the Hill's camper at Walnut Valley Blugrass Festival in Winfield. It's raining pretty hard, so we're stuck indoors. I'm okay with that, the "just hanging out in the camper" has long been one of my favorite parts of Winfield. This is my third (fourth?) trip to Winfield. The first time I came, I came because because Melissa wanted me to. The second time, I came because I wanted to spend more time with the family. This time, I came because I wanted to come to Winfield.

  
I just got this shirt.

My Chromebook's camera is awful.  
  
In other recent news: I took a work trip to San Antonio. It's a pretty town. The Riverwalk is awesome. I wish Kansas City had anything like it. On this work trip I got to attend an Open Compute Project conference and hear a bit about who they are and what they are doing. It was cool. Also _very_ cool was the office space it was being held in. Rackspace's office building is sweet. I have a ton more I could say I appreciated about the trip, but I like to keep work stuff out of the Column - so I'm going to leave it at that.

  
I made a video about sound effect continuity across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is that video:
  
  
Also, a metatorial note (that's a portmanteau of "meta" and "editorial"):

  
I added a couple of pages:

* [Features](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/features.html)
* [Projects](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/projects.html)
* [About](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/about.html)

Those pages are not "final". They will all be continually updated - as necessary. There are some known changes coming. "Features" will be added - I've got a [one already written](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/feature-marvel-cinematic-universe.html), and one in the pipeline. The "Projects" page will have a little blurb/background about each project.

Motto: I Forgot to Remember  
  
Last time I wrote about stuff I had been putting on the back burner for a while. I forgot this stuff.  
  
**SCIENCE AND HUMANITY AND STUFF**  
I wonder if we will ever reach a point where we fully understand how the human body works. Will we ever know what each little synapse in the brain is doing when it fires off. Will that discovery be succeeded by a discovery allowing us to shape the brain after birth to correct defects in the brain and body? Will we learn how to turn off the dopamine hits that are associated with damaging things? Would we be able to reprogram the brain to really and truly _enjoy_ doing stuff that is beneficial to the individual, humanity, and the world? Will we be able to link together in a way that is more meaningful than the means achievable through conversation. Can we abstract consciousness away from the human body? Could we ship that consciousness throughout the universe on miniature space probes? Will we discover a way of living that is objectively the "best", and if so - at what point do we cease being "human"?   
  
This sounds a little bit like the mad shower thoughts of a freshman in philosophy class. \#Deep  
  
**LIFE TRACKER ENDGAME**  
I have been doing a more and more sloppy job with filling out the Life Tracker lately. It used to be that I didn't know what was possible with it, and wanted to capture everything I could. Now I've got a good feel for what data I use and what data I don't, yet each night I've obligated myself to filling it _all_ out. I've decided to set a finish line.  
  
5 Years.  
  
I want to finish out my 5th year of tracking stuff. That means going as is for another 6 months, until late April, 2018\. After which time I want to transition to a new, long-term, more _"journal-like_" system of keeping record - retaining the stuff I care about still, but nixing the stuff whose return isn't worth the investment. It will be built in Android - which gives me a deadline for learning how to do anything _useful_ on the platform. Also it will have a better name... I'll figure that out later.  
  
**2017 FOR AARON AND MELISSA**  
December 31st, 2016 I made a list of fun stuff for Melissa and I to do in 2017\. Yesterday at Kansas City Irishfest we crossed the 10th goal off the 20 goal list. So that puts us a bit behind schedule. Maybe I'll revisit this in my first post of next year. Maybe I'll forget.  
  
Alright - now I've written about all the stuff.  
  
Remember that thing I said about not taking photos? It's still true. I went to Irishfest yesterday and the only picture I got is standing _in_ the Festival area, but looking _out_.

Top 5: Things I Still Value Tracking  
5\. Sleep, food, and exercise tracking (this stuff is automatic already)  
4\. Goal tracking - but in a less intense, less rigid manner  
3\. Location tracking - for Android this could easily be built-in  
2\. The concept of "tags" for each day for various things  
1\. A couple sentence summary of what I did each day  
  
Quote:  
"At first I assumed he was a Mexican, but slowly began to realise that a real Mexican probably wouldn't be wearing a sombrero in a London nightclub. And he'd probably have a real mustache, not a stick-on one. A Mexican with a stick-on mustache would be like a super Mexican, because he'd have two mustaches and that'd be cool, because a super Mexican could probably use his poncho as a cape, and then I realised I was saying all this to the man's face."  
\- Danny Wallace, in the book "Yes Man", upon which the movie was very loosely based -

# Motto: Catch up and mustard

I am alone. My best friend is back home with her family, about to go on vacation. My other friends are busy - at least they are right now. This means that I have some time to dive into the immense backlog of topics I've put en queue to write about on this Blog. Each new topic will be introduced in **BOLD, CAPITOL** text.

I saw **MAN OF STEEL**. These **LINES** stuck out to me:

*"I grew up in Kansas, general. I'm about as American as it gets"*. 
I recognize how much this line must make people from the coasts scoff, but I feel and have always felt that Kansas does represent good, old-fashioned America (for better or worse). Maybe Google feels that way, too, considering they saw Kansas City as the prototypical American city for their initial Fiber rollout.

*"He's coming in through the RSS feeds!"*
This has got to be one of the most hilarious technologically incorrect lines I've ever EVER heard in a movie. I laughed audibly in the theater during a scene that wasn't meant to be funny... and that's usually a bad thing. RSS, for those of you who don't know, is an old-ish tech that allows you to pull content off a website. Google Reader (until very recently) used RSS to build an aggregate channel of all your favorite sites. RSS has positively nothing to do with television or the greater network of multimedia broadcasting.

*"Welcome to the Planet"*
I liked this line. As it's used in the film, it is referring to the *Daily Planet* newspaper where Clark Kent works; but it works on the other level. I like things like that. Wordplay.

Apple's **iOS 7 LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE ANDROID JELLY BEAN** in certain ways. This issue was covered in detail on most tech-type websites a while back. I'm guessing if you care enough to know why or how that is, you probably have already seen it somewhere. I just want to say how delicious it is to see Apple emulate Google's design.

I've heard that Facebook has implemented some changes that make it more like Google+... but I don't have Facebook anymore. I can't really comment.

Disclaimer: I am very aware of how much Google has historically found inspiration for their products from the iPhone and from Facebook. In fact, here's a relevant XKCD:

![google+](assets/101-1.png)
I love XKCD

I'm **PHASING OUT GOOGLE TASKS IN LIEU OF GOOGLE KEEP**. They serve a similar purpose as one another, but Google Keep is actively being developed and Google Tasks is likely one of the next Google products/services to enter the graveyard. Google Keep is better than Google Tasks in every way, save for the ability to add Tasks to your calendar. I assume this functionality will come at some point and I will wonder how I ever got along without it. 

That's a common theme with technology and I. Something new comes out that supersedes something else, and I instantly forget what it was like or how I got along when I used the old thing. Google Hangouts did this to Google Talk. Android 4.0 did this to Android 2.3. 

As I touched on with Post #100 - **MELISSA IS BACK** and all the sudden it's like I have a fiance again! I'm really really glad she is home, that I much cannot overstate. It has been and will continue to be an effort to establish a balance of all things. When you live alone and have opposite sleep cycles of your significant other, the routine establishes itself naturally. You talk in the morning and at night. The rest of your day is yours to do with what you please. Now, we actually have to keep each other in mind when lining out plans. I hope to have more time to write and do my other "guy things" soon. 

"Guy Thing" - Noun
1. Item which is not interesting or well-received by women. *"I don't understand videogames - they are such a guy thing"*
2. Stupid, brutish, activity

**I ACCIDENTALLY DERIVED KARNAUGH MAPS WHILE TRYING TO CREATE A BETTER 4-WAY VENN DIAGRAM**. Karnaugh Maps, or "K-maps" are a tool you learn early on in electrical/computer engineering. They are used to reduce logical constraints in a system made of multiple binary/Boolean inputs. Long story short, I sat down to create a 4-way Venn Diagram that was better than the one I used in [Column #97]({{siteurl}}/97) (about human attractiveness). For reference:

![k-map](assets/101-2.png)
Non-intuitive, hard to draw by hand, and hard to work with on computers
When I was done, I had created this:
![venn](assets/101-3.png)
Easy to draw. Easy work work with on computer. More intuitive.
Those of you who have used K-Maps probably already can see that the 4-Way Venn I created is also a K-Map. Those of you who don't may be helped by this diagram of your usual K-Map I pulled from Wikipedia:
![filled-out](assets/101-4.png)
A = Cute, B = Hot, C = Beautiful, D = Pretty

Note that I'm not proud I accidentally figured this out while exploring the four variables "Cute", "Hot", "Pretty", and "Beautiful".

I had a weird extended daydream about **THE FUTURE OF CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY** the other day. I was thinking about Google Glass and the upcoming tidal wave of smartwatches (seriously, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Motorola, Samsung, Sony, and basically everyone else are rumored to be working on smartwatches). I look forward to the upcoming/already happened advent of "wearable technology". I can't wait to look at my wrist and see something more useful than the time of day. I've looked forward to this upcoming eventuality ever since I first saw Leela's wristlojackimator:
![Leela](assets/101-5.jpg)
That thing.

There's more, though. I think that we may soon converge our technological tethers to the cloud to a single, true broadcast device. The rest of our tech will borrow this connection. Basically, your phone (or something like it) will connect to the internet. Then your watch, glasses, earpiece, tablet, and/or whatever else will connect to your phone. Our pieces of consumer tech are going to build stronger relationships with one-another. 

There was seriously *way* more to it than that. I was going to write a whole feature post about it... but I forgot most of it already.

This backlog of mine included both the **TOP 5** and the **QUOTE**. Just EFWHYEI. It also included **THESE PICTURES**:

3. Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.

Motto: Meet Dr. Tryhard  
  
Melissa and I took a long vacation. For photos, see Facebook. If you don't know me well enough to see my Facebook, that's too bad. I'll include at least one photo on this Column, because that's what I do.  
  
Google I/O happened while we were on vacation. Typically I watch it then gush on this blog about all the cool stuff. I didn't see it this year, though. I have very little to gush about. It's not so much that it's disappointing, it's more just that we've reached peak smartphone. These things we carry around with us reached the point of diminishing returns years ago. That's not meant to be depressing, it's just me saying that our smartphones have already reached their noob gainz.   
  
There was one thing that I got pretty excited about: [Google Home](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/google-assistant-and-google-home-amazon-echo-but-from-google/). Ever since the Amazon Echo came out, every podcast I listen to has gushed about it. They spoke highly of what it is and what it does that I looked at them pretty heavily. I ultimately didn't buy one, though, because I didn't want to start trying to buy into another new ecosystem. "If only it were integrated with my Google account." This will scratch that itch. I hope it's affordable.  
  
Bo Burnham has a new comedy special on Netflix. I gave it a watch the other day and immediately cemented him at the top of my "best active comedians" list. Bo's routines are in league of their own. His show makes other comedians seem lazy, taking the easy path. I know that's not true and I know it's just different styles for different people... but I respect his style and the effort he puts in more than any other comedian. Pure talent... having said all that, I want to throw on a content advisory warning for anyone who's not heard his stuff and might care enough about my recommendation to check it out. It's definitely R rated comedy. The best R rated comedy there is, though. It's not lazy, relying on dirty jokes and phrases to get the humor across. It's just good, man.  
  
Speaking of musicians & artists... I really suggest marrying one. It makes life better than it would be otherwise.  
  
One last thing before I leave you with the picture to go out on - I've been doing before-work workouts. You'll read more about them soon, but I wanted to introduce the fact that I am, in fact, doing them (and not just writing about the benefits of hypothetically doing them).  
  
The picture to go out on - my favorite selfie in recent memory:

Top 5: Benefits of Before Work Workouts  
5\. Start work early, leave work early. That's the benefit of my job.  
4\. It replaces an unhealthy morning routine I found myself stuck in for the past three months... and introduces a new nighttime routine that I always wanted.  
3\. Working out more consistently and with more purpose has lead to strides in the weightroom that I've been wanting to make for a year.  
2\. Working out in the morning introduces the possibility for twoadays. On an unrelated note, it means I'm no longer getting in my car and leaving my post-workout funk behind.  
1\. Working out before work is a more efficient way to accomplish all the things that I have to do and that want to do. It cuts my thirty minute commute to a twenty minute one. It compresses my hour and fifteen minute workouts into a tight forty-five. Morning showers are no longer a stretched out period of lethargy somewhere between wakefulness and sleep. They become a quick transformation between someone who does _work_ and someone who _gets work done_. It gets me from my bed to my car in two minutes instead of two hours. Yes, it took me two hours. I told you it was unhealthy.

Motto: It's Good for You

  
One hundred fifty. I've written one hundred fifty Columns since the inception of the Blogger-based Column. "#1 - Why do this thing again?" was posted on March 16th, 2012\. That was 725 days ago, very nearly two years ago. In the past two years, I've written just over 1 post every 5 days, and I don't regret a thing.  
  
Even high school me approves:

I love writing. I like talking. I have been known to flirt with drawing. I had a passing glance at singing. I forgot dancing's name and have since been awkwardly avoiding situations where dancing and I might have to interact. But I love writing. It's like talking, except you can't get interrupted. The reader has no direct boredom feedback mechanism, so you feel free to go wherever the sentences take you. You have ample time to say what you actually want to say. If you have long enough, you can say it concisely. You have the privileged of takesies-backsies. Writing is therapeutic. Writing is liberating. Writing is fun. I'm glad I do it. I've written one hundred fifty Columns; and I don't feel like stopping any time soon. Interestingly, I don't like writing about writing. I think it's tacky, cliched, or maybe just cheesy. Speaking of therapeutic things, I changed up my workout. My new routine incorporates heavy lifting, High Intensity Interval Training, and general cardio. It's probably the best workout I've ever crafted in terms of overall health benefits. That's largely because I blatantly stole it from my cousin, who has underwent a very impressive and well-earned body transformation over the past 5 months. Writing nurtures the mind. Exercising nurtures the body. What about the spirit? Melissa nurtures the spirit - as do my friends and family. Still, I'd like to find something to feel a little more "free", now that I'm cooped up in an 8x10 cubical 40 hours a week. Current lead candidate: bicycling. Only, there's a problem. I rode my bicycle to work today. It took me 30 minutes to ride a distance that I can easily walk in 20\. I spent more time doing en route repairs on the side of the road than I did riding. I planned on getting a better bike after the wedding, but that timeframe might get pushed forward aggressively if I can't fix my problem.

  
**Top 5: GoPro Accessories**5\. Handlebar Mount - Also good for mounting on railings. 4\. Suction Cup Mount - Great for automotive/weather timelapses. 3\. The Frame - Good if you want to have usable sound in your video. 2\. The head mount - the first person perspective is the single coolest application of a GoPro. 1\. The chest mount - like the head mount, only less prone to causing motion sickeness or coming off when you jump into a river.

Oh hey. I'm writing. I'm also watching **"Frozen"** for the first time in forever. Disney Plus is incredible and an absolute no-brainer as a person with a very young child... or as a person with eyes and ears connected to a heart.

Turns out having a new website format adds about ~3% harder to write posts for. I can't do it from my Chromebook, which is a bummer. I don't really blame the format, though. I blame the Chromebook. Which is a bit of a bummer. I don't think that ChromeOS is *bad* per say. I just wish I had the non-atom processor variant so my Linux access wasn't so stunted. 

Somewhat coincidentally, somewhat causally, my previous Column was mostly a list of habits & this Column is a book report for the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. Spoiler: I liked it. I like the cut of his jib. [Here's his website](http://www.jamesclear.com). I'm sure his traffic is going to spike now that he's got a link from this blog. I hope he's got a good web Hosting service. From here down, I'm just going to put my notes from this book (those written on [Gillespedia](http://www.gillespedia.com), my side project).

# Atomic Habits  
Habits have a compounding effect over time - and because of that, small habits done consistently eventually return huge results. They do more than help you achieve your goals, they bring you closer to being the person you want to be. So start by asking yourself "what does the person I want to be *do*?" Then create a system that enables doing those things. *Good* habits moves you toward being that person, bad habits away. Don't focus too much on immediate goals, focus instead on exercising the system. Each time you repeat a habit, you cast a vote for your new identity. Find the joy in that instead of waiting for the joy of achieving your goal.

The basic habit loop is **cue → craving → response → reward** (the reward reinforces the cue). You can manipulate each step in this process to help adopt good habits and break bad ones.

**Cue** - make habit triggers obvious. Setup your environment to expose good cues often, and hide bad cues. Be very specific with when and how you will perform a habit. Try stacking a habit you aspire to do with one you already do.

*Example: Place moisturizer next to the coffee machine. Tell yourself "after each time I press 'brew', I will moisturize my hands".*

**Craving** - make good habits attractive. Use temptation bundling to stack good habits with things you enjoy (ensuring the good habit and the thing you enjoy don't cast conflicting votes toward your new identity). Also you can associate with people who already have the habit you want.

*Example: "Only after my weekly review of budgets, will l watch the new episode of my TV show."*

**Response** - make the good habit easy & the bad habit hard. Tailor the environment to add or remove friction where possible. Many good habits can be automated & bad habits prevented via one-time actions. Quantity is often more important than quality. You'd benefit more from never failing to meet a daily goal of "do a 2 minute warmup" than from consistently failing to meet a daily goal "do a one hour workout"... and you'll often find after you do the warmup it's often easy to do the workout.

*Example: Unplug the TV after each use and set your journal on the power cable. Commit to writing two sentences before plugging in the TV.*

**Reward** - make it immediately satisfying to perform a good habit by using rewards. Habit trackers can supplement rewards, and be rewards themselves. Make bad habits painful by using a habit contract and an accountability partner.

*Example: After finishing my workout, I will make myself a healthy smoothie and put an X on the calendar next to the blender. If I fail to put 3 Xes in any week this month, I have to do the whole family's laundry by myself next month.* 

Habit trackers are immensely helpful. They are a cue that can serve as a craving and a reward. When using a habit tracker, don't break the chain... and when it breaks, commit to not failing twice in a row. 

Experiment with many different habits. Stick with what naturally works for you. Keep pursuing what is on the edge of your capability - not easy but not impossible. After mastering any given habit, after your interests change, or just every so often, reevaluate how your systems. Ask yourself: Have your habits become rote? Can you dive deeper? Should you to refine or upgrade the person you want to be?

---------

Alright that's it. I highly recommend this book.

Motto: After Writing All of This I Realized Most of it is Embarrassing  
  
Hello internet. I'm writing this in my basement on the couch, waiting for Shadow of the Colossus to download on my PlayStation. I've heard it's a classic, so I'm going to give it a shot.  
  
While it was downloading, I watched Caddyshack. I'd heard it's a classic, so I gave it a shot.  
  
It's extremely nice out right now. So I should go outside and take advantage. It would probably be good for my mental health. Instead I watched a movie, then lifted weights, and now intended on playing a game (once it downloads and I'm done with this) until my wife gets home from her summer gig. We might grill out then. Who knows. Lately all I've really wanted to do outdoors is play golf, but golf is expensive. Playing it by yourself doesn't seem like it would be as fun, and playing it with other people requires coordination & forethought. I am fundamentally lazy. So those things don't happen. Maybe a bike ride. Maybe not.  
  
If it's not clear by now, I'm just writing whatever I'm thinking. I've decided for this Column to just let my mind go wherever, and write down what the little Aaron voice inside my head is saying. He's usually filtered and whittled down so that he doesn't fill space with words like "whittled" that he immediately regrets. Now I'm referring to my internal monologue as a different person than myself. I wonder if that's normal.  
  
Anyway I didn't come here to write about what I'm writing like. I had some ideas.  
  
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I threw all of my Google stuff out the window and bought into Apple's ecosystem. Would I hate it? Would it be just as good? Would I find out that I've been on the wrong side of the fence for years? Would it matter at all, or would I just fall into the exact same life I had before. It's not like my Googleyness defines me. I'm just fairly well placed with what I've got. Sometimes you feel like refreshing things. Lately I've been thinking more and more about how I want this or how I want that. Maybe it's a matter of me not doing what I really want to be doing. Maybe it's a matter of my laptop being 3 years and 3 months old and I'm bored with it. But I'm writing this on it so how bad could it be? Or the PlayStation 3 that's still my only gaming console after more than 6 years. Or the computer that I built a couple years back. Maybe I could upgrade that. Or I could buy a new couch. Or I could just look inward and realize that my lack of satisfaction comes from not being what I want, not not having what I want.  
  
So what do I want to be?  
**Captain America.**   
That's always been my answer for that. I don't think it's a bad answer. I've settled for Captain America meets Tony Stark meets some really lame guy who thinks about himself in terms of which Marvel hero he might most be like. Maybe I should think more on this. I know I want to be a good husband. A good friend. A good person. You're supposed to have that defined by the time you reach adulthood, right?  
  
Part of what's difficult about getting older is that you get better and better at raising your base-level happiness & contentment. You become less and less desperate to get out and go do new things, because you've seen a lot of things you like. You've learned to hone in on those things and surround yourself with them to the extent possible in a normal life. It's a gilded cage. But it's golden. and pretty. So why complain? I'm not even being cynical here. It's a genuinely true thought. I'm not saying getting older and having figured out a lot of stuff you like that makes you happy is a bad thing. It's nice. Way nicer than being young and frustrated constantly by having to do crap you hate for the most part. That said, it's easy to picture a man bordering on retirement who's just spun in one small circle (that he really like's spinning in) for the past 30 years. God I'm 30 years away from retirement. Statements like that make you realize maybe you're not so old. I've got time. I'll get there. Or, at least I'll try. There's a nobility in that, right? Just because you're never "there" because your state of mind constantly changes and you evolve and where "there" is constantly changes doesn't mean you shouldn't chase it. You shouldn't go forward, sideways, and backwards - wherever seems the brightest. Just closing up and settling down for what you've got is stagnation. And stagnation is death according to most radical teenagers. If the music's too loud, you're too old. If I can't live my way then I don't want to live at all says the kid who's got no real responsibilities. What an ass. I can live my way and I want to continue evolving what that is.  

  
For the reader - I do this kind of exercise from time to time. But I usually do it with a pen and paper. That slows my thinking down and I can sort through some crap. This typing thing has let me almost keep up with that little voice and has really gone awry. It's hectic. It's eclectic. Get some perceptive and be redirective. None of that made sense. SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?  
  
This word vomit took about 20 minutes to write. My game is almost done installing now. I'm going to kill some colossi.

Motto: The Theme is "Worlds"... which Passes as a Theme I Suppose

  
The past 4 days have been awesome. Here's why, with pictures & captions!

  
[![](assets/257-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cRv3XA5W790/VdvuiGiRDJI/AAAAAAAB7V4/oAUYeVH-llQ/s1600/IMG%5F20150821%5F224920.jpg)

  
Melissa and I went to Worlds/Oceans of Fun - the local theme park. Traditionally, I don't like theme parks (see the Top 5 for more) but I had a really great night. I even rode this big torturous monstrosity in the picture above.  
  
[![](assets/257-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gTQB90Q3aCk/VdvuiGBEpAI/AAAAAAAB7V4/lg2J7WdqwT4/s1600/IMG%5F20150821%5F093201.jpg)

  
It wasn't just Melissa and I at the park. We were there for Danielle's birthday - with friends! It was good getting to spend time with folks. That's something I've resolved to do more of lately. This notification on my watch was almost as scary as Steel Hawk.  
  
[![](assets/257-3.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Im53Jt5BTPA/VdvxyQPGBQI/AAAAAAAB7Wo/XU0%5FZe8clvg/s1600/IMG%5F20150822%5F111039.jpg)

  
Melissa makes a great hash. I make okay coffee.  
  
[![](assets/257-4.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6V-BNIieLMg/VdvuiLdR2SI/AAAAAAAB7V4/9jHK2mtrIIc/s1600/IMG%5F20150822%5F191231.jpg)

  
We went and watched my newest niece Kate's baptism. Melissa and Kate hadn't met before. Melissa said hi, Kate didn't say much back. I'll try not to hold that against her.  
  
[![](assets/257-5.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Recfja0KbY/VdvuiJYgdSI/AAAAAAAB7V4/m0pO0lPjkuM/s1600/IMG%5F20150822%5F200603.jpg)

  
Afterwards the family went out to get some Mexican food & margaritas. I don't see Aunt Net enough.  
  
[![](assets/257-6.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cI6QWdy%5FGag/VdvuiCiIhOI/AAAAAAAB7V4/Kp0Xfw%5FS7wE/s1600/IMG%5F20150823%5F131826.jpg)

  
Melissa is going back to the KU to get her Masters in Music Therapy. I rode along to hang out and see the old sites. Our first stop was Melissa's favorite Lawrence dining joint.  
  
[![this is a photosphere, but it's not embedded right cause I'm lazy](assets/257-7.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5n5jVsnkQak/VdvuiLpX8OI/AAAAAAAB7V4/UxyRLP00wWY/s1600/PANO%5F20150823%5F160840.jpg)

  
The Engineering complex is seriously twice the size it was 3 years ago. The dorms are totally different, too. There's two new ones. They look great. They make a really cool courtyard area that I'm extremely jealous of. I didn't know what nostalgia meant until I made this trip. It was mind-blowing.  
  
[![](assets/257-8.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2GY%5FPU6WJRc/VdvuiNH47vI/AAAAAAAB7V4/9ZbsxXe5EGg/s1600/IMG%5F20150823%5F172054.jpg)

  
Oh also I think I found the Hatch from _LOST._  
  
[![](assets/257-9.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MYdqdGGVui0/VdvuiPmLE6I/AAAAAAAB7V4/--Zyeq44nqM/s1600/IMG%5F20150823%5F214612.jpg)

  
After her meeting in Lawrence we had to run back toward Kansas City to go to the Starlight Theater and watch Incubus - whom Melissa introduced me to at KU in those dorms I was nostalgic about. The concert was great.   
  
[![](assets/257-10.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tPMbw1zVhwM/VdvuiMSJmPI/AAAAAAAB7V4/PgKJRCxsKMs/s1600/IMG%5F20150824%5F181908.jpg)

  
Jonboy came up to Kansas City today. We three had a celebration of our respective accomplishments: Jon with his new job, Melissa with her first day of Graduate School classes & GTAing, and me with my recent re-org at work.  
  
[![](assets/257-11.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LyDCDeMEcWw/VdvuiJI3GCI/AAAAAAAB7V4/0cEWEW0DjpY/s1600/IMG%5F20150824%5F213049.jpg)

  
Melissa ran home to do homework, but Jon and I decided to hang out for a while longer at the Legends. We are both big [fans of the Hitman videogame franchise](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/11/47-hit-out-on-facebook.html), so we decided to go watch the newest adaptation of that franchise to the big screen: Agent 47\. We went into the movie knowing that it was rated at a glorious 7% on Rotten Tomatoes. It deserves that rating... but we still had a really good time. I took this picture, because no part of the movie was worth representing in photos.

  
Top 5: Reasons I Don't Like Theme Parks

5\. They are expensive. "Step right up and pay me $5 to throw a ball at some cans!"  
4\. They are crowded. Crowds stress me out.  
3\. Paying money for the explicit purpose of "having fun" puts pressure on you to have fun. It is probably a personal failing, but I have a hard time making the transition between "I'm supposed to be having fun" and actually having fun.  
2\. Rides are, for the most part, terrifying, horrible torture devices that petrify me while I'm on them and/or leave me feeling like absolute garbage afterwards.  
1\. I'm a curmudgeon/old man who yells at kids from the chair on his porch.

Motto: Do the Thing the Person You Want to be Would Do - and Eventually that will be Who You Are.  
  
Does Anyone Remember When I Used to Write Everything in My Blog in Book-Title-Capitalization-Case? That was annoying.  
  
Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Podcast is an incredible thing. The dude puts out audiobook-length episodes for free. Better yet, they're actually good & entertaining. I didn't care about history at all going in - and now it's slightly interesting! If you've not checked them out, you should.  
  
I bring up the Hardcore History Podcast because I was listening to his most recent episode and he sort of nonchalantly throws out a reference to the Vision from the Avengers. Shortly after that, he made a reference to Captain America. In another podcast I listen to, This Week in Tech, they were talking about Thanos the other week. It's really neat to be a fan of comic book stuff right now. These characters that I'd only ever slightly heard of back in 2012 when the original "The Avengers" came out are now just casually referenced in completely unrelated media. It makes me happy.  
  
Sometimes I struggle with transitions. It takes me a while to get comfortable in any given new setting or situation. I'm sitting outside on my deck writing this right now - it took me probably 20 minutes to "settle in" and feel like I wasn't just getting used to the temperature, the things around me, and the essence (for lack of better vocabulary on my part) of the location.  
  
So you can imagine how I'm coping with the idea of transitioning from being just a dude to being just a dude with a kid. Does any bigger transition happen in life? Maybe if something terrible happened, that would be a bigger transition; barring that I can't think of anything quite so transformative that happens between the ages of 13 and 60\. The big things you'd expect to come with lots of changes were all pretty smooth. I got married. Life goes on. I bought a house. Life goes on. I switched jobs. Life goes on. I'm having a kid... life becomes more?  
  
Each moment that I'm not actively doing one thing, I'm thinking about it. Even sometimes when I'm doing things that should keep me in the moment, my mind wanders. I'm play sand volleyball and thinking about "how would a baby fit into this situation?" between plays. I'm watching a movie in theaters thinking about how we'll handle having an infant, how that will change as the infant becomes a toddler, as the toddler becomes a kid, and the kid becomes a little dude.  
  
Did you ever watch the movie "Mystery Men"? The one with the sort of quirky superheroes, such as the guy who can turn invisible, but only if nobody's looking at him. There was a character in there played by William H. Macy called "The Shoveler". I remember him in the movie saying something to the effect of "I'm the Shoveler. I shovel very well."  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm "The Spreadsheeter". I spreadsheet very well. I was going to write a bunch more about this but instead I'll just do this.

Motto: "September" is an anagram of "Mr. Best Pee" 

  
I'm looking forward to September for tons of reasons. September 1st - Labor Day... free vacation. September 2nd - the XKCD: What If? book is coming out. September 2nd - the draft for my first ever season of Fantasy Football happens. September 4th - the Moto 360 and successor to the Moto X is getting announced.

September 9th - IKEA opens less than 2 miles from our place September 9th - the iPhone 6 (and maybe other stuff) is is getting announced. September 9th - Captain America: The Winter Soldier is coming out on Blu-Ray. September 9th - Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 1 is coming out on Blu-Ray. September 19-21st - 43rd Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield. September 23rd - Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2 premiere. September 24th - Modern Family Season 6 premiere. Sometime in September - Android L, Android TV, and the next Nexus tablet & phone?

Sometime in September - The Renaissance Festival All of September - Temperatures will be more tolerable. All of September - the challenge of the MONTH WILL BE DIFFERENT AND I WILL BE ABLE TO WASTE TIME ON MY PHONE MORE EFFECTIVELY AGAIN. I'm looking forward to September.

  
Now for the other thing.

  
One of my goals for August was to have fewer projects. At the time I didn't know how to put that into a coherent English sentence, but I knew there was something I wanted. Something regarding projects and the word "less". I have come to realize that " less projects" is not what I wanted; what I wanted was "not EVERYTHING is a project." Don't get me wrong, I love projects. They give a sense of completeness, but the need for completeness and perfection can sometimes harm you when "just good" would have sufficed. The best case example I can think of for this came at work last week. I learned a new fact about a system I'm helping to build and my first inclination was "cool, what else is there to learn about this system? What other related facts are there to learn? Who would know these facts? Which platform would be the best choice for my documentation of this system? Where can I fit this documentation into my workflow such that it is accessible when I need to refer to it, but not cluttering up my occupational RAM?" Then I thought, "maybe I should just take this fact for what it is, remember it, then move on." I like projects because they are clean. Everything has a purpose. Nothing ad hoc will remain out in the voids with no proper place. But, man, sometimes you just need to know that the server you are working with is green and move on. (That wasn't the actual fact.)  
  
So. That's what I meant.

Motto: Focus, by Marc Jacobs

  
I'm writing this post in First Watch. If you don't know what First Watch is, I feel bad for you, and it is a breakfast & lunch restaurant that serves up the manifestation of deliciousness. 

  
My last (extremely long) post covered the year wrap up of the Life Tracker. I have come to additional conclusions since I wrote that post. For example, check out the standard deviation of my calorie intake by day of week:

  
[![](assets/206-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f0Kumn2Plxs/VChogOMe1jI/AAAAAAABeM8/fsefhj5Jkto/s1600/%23206%2B-%2BCaloires%2BSTDEV%2Bvs%2BWeekday.png)

  
What does that chart show? Statistically, it's showing the standard deviation of my calorie intake by day of week. What that means is this: I eat most consistently on Tuesdays for some reason. Friday has the widest variety of calorie totals.

  
I have not been tracking thing for the past week... and it's been crazy. It's not healthy, but I think the best part about working out, or eating healthy, or accomplishing a lot was the moment I got to write down at the end of the day "Aaron did well". I did yoga two days ago... it was great and very much the healthy and right thing to do... but I didn't get to give myself fictional fitness points, and that was sad.

  
So, basically, I decided to keep on Life Tracking - but with a new Life Tracker. I wanted to incorporate all the knowledge I gained throughout the year last year. Melissa was not in Kansas City this weekend, so I had some time. I sat down with a blank Spreadsheet at 9:30AM yesterday, then, 14 hours later, I created a new Life Tracker. It's _different_, but similar in spirit. It incorporates new tracking points like my body weight, my sleep patterns, my pedometer readout. It's got more to it - but it's actually much, much simpler than the old one. Instead of inputting things throughout the day, I just do a single summary input at the end of the day.

  
When I said "14 hours later", what I didn't say was I worked on the project literally that whole time. I ate lunch and dinner from the slow cooker meal I made the day before. I didn't stop, pause, lose focus, or otherwise leave the project for 14 hours straight. If I had a super power, "focus on things that I'm interested in" would probably be it.  
  
Even Thor was impressed.

I just realized that picture has the movie "Thor: The Dark World" _and_ the cat Thor: The Dark World. Happy coincidence!  
  
Speaking of Marvel. I got a new Captain America shirt. I like it.

Top 5: Difference Between the New Life Tracker and the Old One

5\. It doesn't rely on a homemade diet tracker.  
4\. It doesn't rely on a homemade workout tracker.  
3\. It doesn't rely on a homemade budget tracker.  
2\. It's much more flexible. Data errors should happen much less frequently and correcting them is now as simple as possible.  
1\. I only have to use it once a day.

Motto: T Minus 23 Days

  
I swear I'm taking these 30 Day Challenges seriously. But, once again, I'm going to have to change (or amend, maybe) this month's goal. This month's goal was: "I, Aaron Gillespie, will run 50 miles in the month of April". We have reached the 10th day of April, and I, Aaron Gillespie, have only ran 10 miles. That's not bad, right? But it's not on track to reach 50, and it's brought to my attention a big problem. If I run much over much over a mile, I wind up being in pain for the rest of the evening. The pain goes right through my SI joint. My hip feels exactly like it used to before I got on antiinflamitories. My rheumatologist (joint doctor) said that running is awful and would probably aggravate my autoimmune condition. Turns out she was right. So I'm amending my goal. I, Aaron Gillespie, will run, walk, ellipt, row, swim, and/or bike the combined effective total of 50 miles in April. Biking, rowing, and swimming will have some sort of conversion factor: 2.5 miles on a bike = 1 mile on a treadmill = 0.25 miles in the pool. Something like that. The goal is now a little more subjective, a little less pure than "running 50 miles", but the idea stands. The theme is still there: burn calories and build cardiovascular capacity through aerobic exercise. This is all part of my overall fitness goals: to find the crux between aerobic, anaerobic, and flexibility exercises - while eating a diet full of meats, vegetables, fruits, and, to a lesser extent, dairy products and grains. A healthy body is balanced on all fronts. That's one part of my overall goals for living a quality, fully self-actualized life. I'm continually impressed with my own foresight when it comes to the Life Tracker. I haven't had to change any of my fundamental goals: Diet, Excercise, Money, Mind, Management, Work, and Others. I first wrote about my "solution for keeping track of the chaos of life" in Column #76, 53 weeks ago. My first tracked week started Monday, April 22nd, 2013\. That's 50 weeks ago. I've successfully tracked on 35 of those 50 weeks, and I've learned a ton about myself along the way. During the 3 weeks that lapsed between initial conceptualization and the real-world implementation a few different things happened: 1\. I learned to write javascript 2\. I learned how to interface with Google Docs' backend 3\. My code brought to life an inefficient, inelegant system... but a system that worked 4\. I flew out of the country for the first time 5\. I got engaged I wrote those in order of increasing importance. Importance didn't increase linearly, nor exponentially, perhaps logarithmically? Perhaps logarithm-in-the-exponentially? As of yesterday, Melissa and I have been engaged for 1 year.

 As of next next next Saturday, we'll be married.

  
Top 5: Things I've Learned in a Year (35 weeks) of Life Tracking

5\. In terms of things I'm good at: Management > seeing friends > keeping my body healthy > keeping my mind healthy > staying successful at work. Should I be worried about my job? I got good performance reviews last year, and my work numbers have gone up significantly since starting this new job... so in theory I should go from good to really good. 4\. I work out only 2.4 times per week. Of those 2.4 times, 0.6 are legs focused, 0.8 are upper body, 0.8 are cardiovascular, and 0.1 is flexibility. I need to stretch more. I need to workout more. My goal is 1 of each type every week. Should be easy. 3\. I don't track money consistently enough. Things automatically pulled from my banking account are hard to track. Also it doesn't help that a weekly summary doesn't make much sense as far as money is concerned. Money is the area where the Tracker needs the most help. 2\. My macronutrient ratio (by calorie) is basically 35% fats, 45% carbs, and 20% protein. While that's not as bad as it sounds, I could use more protein and less carbs. 1\. I eat 2635 calories/day on average. That number varies wildly, but the number of days in the 2500 to 2700 range is more than double that of any other 200 calorie range.

Motto: Good Times

  
This weekend was a good one. I saw my family. I did things for the wedding. I played videogames with my two best friends. I had all of my paleo cheat meals back-to-back.

  
My cousins and I took this photo, which is now officially a tradition:

This is the whole series:

Pictures circa 2005, 2011, and 2014\. Another way to look at that: I was in high school, then college, and now working.  
  
We looked at suits and stuff. We played Battlefield and stuff. We got haircuts and stuff. We talked about life and stuff. It was a grand old time.  
  
**Life Tracking** \- I first came up with the idea just before I went to Thailand. Although that was 8 months ago, I'm celebrating the end of my 6th complete month of Life Tracking. I took a few weeks off every now and then... just to maintain sanity.  
  
Either way, I now have tracked half a year. All the money I've spent, all the food I've eaten, all the exercises I've done, and all the goals of the Demetri List are tallied up, sitting right beside me on my laptop screen. In [Demetri Martin's If I... standup special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzsEtafv-FA#t=378), the one that inspired the first version of what ended up becoming the Life Tracker project, he tracked 26 weeks before quitting. I have finally reached my half-year goal, and it would be justifiable for me to quit... but I like doing it. I'm going to keep going.  
  
Life Tracking is how I know that my paleo diet has me eating 30% fewer calories than average. It's what tells me that spend too much on restaurants and not enough on groceries. It's a diary. It's a tool. It's one of my favorite things I've ever done.  
  
**Other stuff** \- I'm re-re-re-reconsidering my EDC. I've already written about it ad nauseam, so I'll just say this - situations change and I'm adapting. This time, I'm consolidating and lightening the load. I'm sure I'll subject you to more detail in a future post.

  
Top 5: Weekly Goal Values vs. Average Values in Half a Year of Life Tracking

5\. Workouts - Goal: 4\. Actual: 2.5.  
4\. Money Spent on Entertainment - Goal: $20\. Actual: $21  
3\. Demetri Goals Completed (out of 175) - Goal: 100\. Actual: 78.  
2\. Daily Carbohydrate Intake - Goal: 225\. Actual: 312.  
1\. Daily Calorie Intake - Goal: 2750\. Actual: 2710.

Motto: As Google as it gets

A long time ago, somebody asked me "what was I passionate about". I didn't have a good answer for them then. I think I stuttered something about "movies" or something else that wasn't really an answer. I have a good answer for that now. I'm passionate about Google. Long story short. Google is the best at what it does, and it does a lot of things. Another blogger I conspire with wrote a great post about Google Plus. I agree with everything she said and would like to comment on the record how pretty she is. I could really go on forever about every little thing Google does and why it is awesome... but instead I'll move on to other awesome topics.

I watched THE AVENGERS. You can read any online review you want, but I think you don't need to know anything more than the following - Aaron's review of "The Avengers"

The Avengers
It was AWESOME.

That's it. No question about it. It was great and everyone should watch it. ([proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOrNdBpGMv8)

Also in the news of the awesome: One week from today I will be the proud owner of a Bachelor's of Science from the University of Kansas in Electrical Engineering.

So that's cool. More on that at a later date.

Last awesome news: I just manually updated my Nexus to Android 4.0.4. I got tired of waiting for Verizon to start pushing the update out.

It seems to be the norm with my posts lately that I cover two pretty unrelated topics. I'm continuing that trend today.

# Ambiguity

English sucks.

It is *especially* apparent to me lately how much English sucks thanks to a coincidence of unrelated events. I'm learning about a very abstract domain while *also* teaching a 2 year old some of the nuances of our native tongue. For example - "native tongue" means "primary language you learned growing up", not really anything to do with the muscle rolling around in your mouth. 

I'll set aside some small topics *(like how the letter "c" serves no purpose that couldn't be covered by other letters)*, and topics I've covered in the past ([like how we should have a 1:1 correspondence between letters and phonemes](https://aarongilly.com/397/#english-is-dumb), and today focus on a topic near and dear to my engineering/dumb boy heart:

Clarity.

English has a nasty habit of enabling its speakers to use a lot of words to not actually say anything meaningful. It is difficult to construct a wholly unambiguous sentence. I think that's why lawyers get paid so much. Things like "passive voice", demonstrative pronouns, and the attribution of adjectives to pairs of nouns lend to obvious questions. Looking at a description of a process, it's incredibly frustrating to find things like:

*Once the house is under contract, it is inspected. If the inspection finds any big cracks or stains, they may want those fixed.*

Okay.... but who's responsibility is it to inspect the house? Who makes the offer? What level of 'inspection' is required for the criteria to be satisfied? Is there a problem if the inspection finds big cracks or **big** stains? Or is it "big cracks" and (any variety of) stains? Who's the "they"? 

## Other Examples

*"I'll call you next Friday"*. - okay... But it's Monday. Do you mean 5 or 12 days from now?

*"My dad went golfing with his buddy, and his game was below par."* - okay... whose game was below par, the dad or the buddy? Also do you mean below par like *good* for golf or below par like *bad*.

*"I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole"*. - inspired by Demetri Martin, am I using the pole to touch the thing, or is the pole more so just in my presence?

*"I need that tomorrow by 7"*. - okay... do you mean before work after work?

*"I'm hungry"*. - okay.... Hi Hungry I'm dad.

And this great example per [this Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-ambiguous-in-a-sentence):

*"I saw a man on a hill with a telescope"*. - okay, did you use a telescope to see a man on a hill? Or did you see a man who was on a hill in possession of a telescope? Or are you on the hill and you saw a man who may or may not have also been on the hill who may have the telescope...unless you used it to see him?

## Ontology Languages

I could fall down a rabbit hole here *real quick*, so I'll just say this:

There exists a class of language whose primary purpose is the unambiguous description of complex domains. They range in form [from human readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempto_Controlled_English) to [very much not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web_Rule_Language).

# Long Term Thinking

I've been using technology for long enough to know that things go away.

On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for every product you use goes to zero.


No basket you put your digital eggs into is guaranteed to hold them safely. You can either succumb to that as an *inevitability* and restart from scratch every time a service you use goes away or you get a new computer that doesn't work with your old stuff, **or** you can think ahead and implement some best practices to minimize your chance of loss, mitigate it when it happens, and generally sleep easier at night not having to worry about years of work and memories randomly becoming inaccessible.

## Where You Store Your Stuff

So your store everything on your computer (or your phone, whatever). Your computer can have a hard drive failure, or you could fall prey to ransomware, or you could have what they call at SpaceX a "Rapid Unintentional Disassembly".

<figure class="align-center">

</figure>

Okay cool, so you make periodic backups to an external hard drive. What if your house is broken into and both are taken? Or it burns down?

Okay cool, so you put all your stuff in the cloud. What if (whatever service provider) goes belly-up unexpectedly? What if your account is hacked? What if the company decides for *whatever* reason your account is fraudulent and shuts it down? These things happen.

Personally, I do all 3 of the above. One of my rotating periodic reviews is to make backups of everything in my "main" folder. That's in the cloud, in an external hard drive (which I keep in a Pelican Case), and on my computer locally.

*Fun fact: one day after writing this I also successfully turned an old external hard drive and a Raspberry Pi I wasn't really using into a Network Attached Storage device. Now I've got easier backup access & I can code easier now from the iPad, so that's cool. Sooner or later we'll get a legit NAS.*

## How You Store Your Stuff

I think most people nowadays have probably considered the first topic. We've all had a computer go belly up, or a service go the way of the dodo. But, have you ever had a file that you couldn't open anymore because the *file itself* is the issue? Not all file formats are created equal. 

Some formats are OS-specific. Many depend on a particular piece of software (or even *hard*ware). There are a few "safe bets", though. See the Top 5. 

For more on this topic, I suggest reading "[The Organized Mind](https://www.notion.so/The-Organized-Mind-62596c6f9f404bfa8034a6cfa97a9681)" by Daniel Levitin, which has the distinction of being the most-frequently-cited book in my [Notes](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea).

## Future-Proofing

### Use Open Source Standards

Have a preference for file types that store plain text (e.g. ".txt", ".csv"), or zipped plain text files (e.g. ".ods", ".xlsx", ".odf", ".docx"). Or use well-recognized (preferably ISO-backed) standards, such as ".pdf". Again see the Top 5. 

### Own Your Own Standards

This is a bit[^2] niche. As you mature in your use of technology and capabilities, try building your *own* standards. These could be as simple as "here's the folder structure I use" or as complicated as "here's a normalized database of everything I ever really care to save or be able to find". A future-proof system is one that's dependent on *techniques*, not specific tools.

Technique's trump tools because techniques are timeless. A tool is only as good as your knowledge of how to use it, how well it fits your situation, and how long it stays around. A well-honed technique is both enduring and flexible and will serve you well into the future. You have the freedom to consider and adopt your own, personal techniques for *anything*. If you build a common approach to how you like to store, access, and work with your information - you can become somewhat tool-independent. You build a system, then you find a tool that works *within* that system, rather than going: tool *first,* system later.

An over-the-top-but-I'm-actually-doing-it example is "Aaron API'[^3]. That's sort of the culmination of **years** of life tracking, coding, and generally thinking about what I want to have and how to best create it. I've defined a standard approach to how I will store new pieces of data, how they can be queried, and what components any new additions will have to include. This separates the frontend presentation of the data from the backend storage of the data.

My [Knowledge Base](https://www.notion.so/Knowledge-Base-6ad05a4614f0472ba815650853148634) is another such situation where I came up with a standard approach and committed to it. 

### Takeout

Any new service I'm going to allow myself to become reliant upon as a part of my personal information and productivity system must support takeout. That is to say, it must let you *take* your data *out* of their system in a way that can be made useful via automated means. [I have already written extensively about Google Takeout.](https://aarongilly.com/366) That's a great service Google has, and it sets the bar for every other service.

Before I allowed myself to commit to Notion to the extent I have, I got very familiar with their export options. They are *fantastic*. I periodically (every month, currently) export all my stuff for safe keeping.

# Top 6: Safest File Formats


## 6. .tiff & .svg


Looking around from list to list, the ".tiff" file consistently shows up. It's not one I've ever used. Thankfully, .png & .jpg are usually *also* listed. In terms of vector images, SVGs are the way to go. 

## 5. .mp3 or .flac


The pervasiveness of the .mp3 format makes it a good candidate for sticking around. It's also got the backing of two ISO Standards and can be implemented by anyone free of charges. If you need lossless audio, apparently ".flac" is the way to go. I've got no experience with .flac files.

## 4. .mp4


Believe it or not there isn't really any better format than .mp4 for video storage in terms of future-proofing.

## 3. All Microsoft Office formats ending in "X"


While Microsoft Office is fundamentally proprietary, they are by far and away the most popular document formats available for in all varieties of "office" files. The "X" at the end, I recently learned, denotes that the file is .XML-based. Fun fact: you can actually change the MS file extensions from ".xlsx" (or ".docx" or ".pptx") to ".zip", then extract that ("unzip") to see how the files work. 

## 2. .pdf


If you have no need to edit a document ever again, there's nothing better than plain old .pdf files. The Portable Document Format (or "pdf") is a wholly self-contained file, not dependent on software, operating system, or any other specific tools to open it... and it's backed by ISO Standard 32000. When you've got an ISO Standard supporting your format, you're pretty solid.

## 1. .txt


Text files are essentially immortal. This makes .txt (and its variants, e.g. ".csv", ".md") an absolutely ideal place for storing something like an ever-expanding body of interconnected notes. See [this incredibly thorough blog written on the topic](http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html). See [this notetaking application whose entire philosophy is all about this](https://obsidian.md). Anything using Unicode (primarily the UTF-8 encoding) is going to be golden for long past your expected lifespan, whoever's reading this. Like ".pdf", it's got the backing of an ISO standard (ISO 10646)

# **Quote:**


> Daddy can you say 'woo woo'. <cite>my son</cite>, I needed a quote and decided to just quote whatever the next thing my kid said.


[^1]: Probably consider the potential ramifications of storing things like "tax returns" and other sensitive documents in the cloud, though. Use your judgment.

[^2]: This is a bit of an understatement.

[^3]: I need to hire a marketing firm to come up with better names for my projects.

# Motto: Google Plus is better

It was just pointed out to me that I should make a column comparing Google+ to Facebook, so when people ask me why Google+ is better than Facebook I can just refer them to this. So I'm doing a very very short version of that right now:

There are three 3 social networks - Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.

Twitter is full of short, random tweets about anything. When you tweet, we pretty much tweet to the entire world. When you go to Twitter, you'll see 140 character snippets from celebrities, people that don't actually exist, people you've never met, and rarely, people know and care about talking about stuff you know and care about.

Facebook is full. Facebook is full of pictures of the kids of and news about people you kinda sorta used to know. When you post on Facebook, you are sharing not with everyone in the world, just basically everyone you've ever met.

Google+ is less full. What is there, though, is way more directed for you. Who you share things with is an integral part of Google+, so things that get shared with you generally apply to you directly.

## Twitter:
Pros -
Public tweets are searchable
Hashtags allow for post discovery and great filtering and searches
Cons - 
Tweets are limited in scope and content
Sharing with select people is downplayed, which leads to lots of noise
Personal, directed sharing of things is not easy - there is a lack of structure

## Facebook:
Pros -
Everyone has it. Your friends from school. Your coworkers. Your camp friends. They can all keep up with you and see what you are doing.
Native photo viewer with the ability to comment on things directly - there is a strong structure
Cons -
Everyone has it. Your mom. Your teacher. Your boss. Your 12 year old cousin. They can all keep up with you and see what you are doing.
Facebook gives you the ability to waste infinite amounts of time learning things you don't really need to know about people you don't really need know. It has turned "stalking" into a culturally accepted habit.
Facebook makes everything "official". You aren't really "dating" until it's on Facebook. You aren't really someone's "friend" unless you've added each other on Facebook. Every post and every picture carries the burden of being accessible to anyone at anytime. This scrutiny or opportunity for scrutiny later on gives each post you write a relatively equal amount of meaning. This interjects extra meaning into some situations that shouldn't warrant any while simultaneously removing meaning from some that do. 
Facebook has a very "I'm a 14 year old girl and I need to show off to everyone" mindset. Here's pictures from my vacation to New York - everyone look at these and be jealous about how awesome my life is. Here's pictures of my with my pretty friends. Here's a picture of me doing something fun and exciting with someone you've never met - I just wanted to let you know so you could know how cool and fun and exciting and cool and fun I am.

## Google+:
Pros -
Every time you share anything, Google+ makes you actively select who you are sharing it with. This is a simple idea with paradigm-shifting implications. Things you see on Google+ were intentionally shared for you, with you in mind, and thereby usually carry some sort of meaning or importance to you directly. Google+ has all the features of Facebook, with the addition of the perfect level of privacy.
Google Hangouts - 
You know Skype? The thing that lets you video chat over the internet? All you have to do is install Skype, get a username, have the person you want to talk to install Skype and get a username, swap user names, then start the program and start a Skype call. Oh - and you can get more than two people on a call if you want - all you have to do is have everyone pay for the more premium services. 
Google Hangouts allow up to 10 people to join in on a group video chat (or "hangout") entirely for free - using only your Google account. Hangouts can be started or joined in on from any internet-connected computer, phone, or tablet. I have used Google Hangouts to wake Melissa up in Thailand while I was shopping, group chat with her, her sister, and her parents, and to do a screen share to show someone how to work a program on the computer. This was all free, and will always be free. Google Hangouts alone would be enough of a reason to get on Google+.
Integration with Android. It's native and it works better than any other social client/cell phone integration that I've ever come across.
Cons -
Not everyone uses Google+ yet.
???

When Google+ first came out, critics claimed it was a blatant copy of Facebook. Google+ has, by and large, grown into its own niche and built out its own products and services that less and less resemble Facebook. It's also interesting to note that Facebook's recent redesign looks startlingly similar to how Google+ has looked for the past half year. Not that that's bad, it's just something funny to note.

I want to work for NASA. Then, when I get tripped up by problems in normal life, I will say "I can't do this, it's not rocket science."

That's my joke. Boom.

I scheduled a flight to Thailand. That's happening. 

April 5th to the 14th.

I'll probably have an interesting post around April 15th.

Here's a picture:

# Reviewing 75 Hard*
71 days ago I got a message from Melissa:

> [!quote] Ever wanted to try 75 Hard? - <cite>Melissa</cite>

Within an hour it was decided - we were doing it. We were about a month into summer, and some structure and a good challenge was never better timed. Although we've got a few more days to go before it's "done", I have time to write this now, so here it is.

## What it is
### 75 Hard
I overviewed 75 Hard already in [[454]], but for the sake of completeness, here it is again.

> 75 Hard is a challenge in which you adhere to the following rules **every day**:
>
> 1. Work out for 45 minutes x2 per day, one of them being outdoors
> 2. Follow a diet
> 3. Abstain from alcohol
> 4. Drink a gallon of water (plain water, ice optional)
> 5. Read 10 pages of a non-fiction book (with your eyes, not your ears)
> 6. Take a progress picture every day
>
> The point of all of this is _partly_ about physical fitness, but **mostly** about _mental fitness_. It’s about discipline. One day is not so bad, but 75 days in a row is the challenge. It’s a change in lifestyle. One that requires you to live outside your comfort zone daily.

### 75 Hard *Asterisk*
We did not do proper "75 Hard" - partly because it's **hard**, and partly because we had different goals. I did not "take a progress picture every day"[^2]. I don't see that as important. I did not work out **for a full 45 minutes** twice every day - I probably did about half the time. The other half I did 40 minutes of strength training, or I did a 30 minute walk. You ever try doing 45 minutes of cardio outside ***while taking care of a 3 year old and 5 year old***? How does that work? I want my children to have a positive opinion of exercise, and forcing them to walk for 45 minutes when it's 90+ degrees outside is not something I think would help with that. We did what we could. Always got in 2 things we called workouts, but they weren't always strenuous[^3].

So, sure, we did a 75 Hard *Asterisk*... but it was great. And I think being dogmatic about every single rule to the letter of the law 100% would have made it less *enjoyable*, which would make me less likely to recommend it or want to continue.

## Results
Okay enough preamble, was it good?

Yes.

75 Hard* was **excellent**. We have enjoyed the heck out of it - despite its hardness. Melissa and I both have given it wildly glowing reviews, agreeing it was one of the best decisions we made. We have spent a ton more time together than we typically would have, as we've decided to do most of our workouts together. We explored all sorts of places and things around us that we've said "someday we'll get to that". We've both gotten literally *harder*. My midsection has trimmed up noticeably. We've learned we enjoy walks. We read [The Bullet Journal Method](https://gillespedia.com/sources/The+Bullet+Journal+Method), a stellar book. We've eaten better. Drank zero alcohol. I feel physically better all the time right now than I have ever before. 

We started (and at this point, nearly completed) the "Beachbody" brand's "Dig Deeper" workout with Shaun T (the dude from "Insanity", if you've heard of it). It was a perfectly timed companion piece to 75Hard. It's about 45 minutes every day and put me out of my comfort zone with regard to exercising - but also the program is meant to be easy on the joints, which is exactly what I needed.

But 75 Hard wasn't *perfect*. It takes a lot of time out of your day to work out twice and read 10 pages. We found that **sleep** started to suffer. In order to get it all done, we had to push back bedtime pretty frequently.

## Infinite Firm
While 75 Hard was genuinely great, it was also not something I'd want to do indefinitely... and I also don't want to crash out of it. Instead, my off-ramp is something I'm dubbing:

> [!tip] Infinite Firm
> 1. Work out every day
> 2. Do intermittent fasting, except for social reasons
> 3. No alcohol on work nights
> 4. Drink a gallon of water, at least 1/2 of which is plain.
> 5. Spend 30+ minutes outside every day.
> 6. Read a book or meditate for 10 minutes

### Work Out Every Day
I think one of the biggest changes that 75 Hard has instilled in me is the idea that working out every day is **not** overkill, but actually a good idea. If you work out every day, you don't have to wrestle with the urge to say "well, I'll just make *today* a rest day" then get yourself into trouble with pushing your 3 weekly workouts back and back until you're doing Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. That doesn't work. What does work (for me, a least) is taking away the "not *today*" excuse. 
This is also necessary if I'm to achieve my fitness goals of maintaining good **overall** functionality. If you're only working out 3 to 4 times per week, it's hard to do strength, cardio, and mobility training to any meaningful extent. Working out daily allows for something like 3-4 strength training days per week, 2-3 cardio days per week, and one day spent on flexibility/yoga.

### Do Intermittent Fasting, Except for Social Reasons
I like intermittent fasting. It works for me... but I have been annoyed on a couple of occasions where I've had to say no to things like birthday cake after 7pm. I think the ~10:30am to ~6:30pm core works for days at home. It keeps me from late night snacking, and it prevents me from doing cheap and easy but terrible for you breakfast foods... but an occasional night out or breakfast before a day with friends isn't going to ruin anything.

### No Alcohol on Work Nights
Pretty obvious. I have found I haven't really missed drinking much, but there have been a couple of occasions where a drink would have been nice and non-goal killing - but on the whole drinking during the week is not necessary nor good. 

### Drink a Gallon of Water, at least 1/2 of Which is Plain
This is something that's on 75 Hard just to force people to realize how much water they *don't* drink. For me it was pretty easy, other than it prevented me from counting protein powder, or preworkout water as water. So I've wound up drinking the gallon AND a couple additional water bottles full. I don't need clear pee to feel healthy. I don't drink soda. That's good enough.

### Spend 30+ Minutes Outside
This is taking the place of a 2nd workout, which is done outside. Being outside is good. Humans weren't meant to do what we do every day. Getting outside and walking around was possibly the single best result from all of 75 Hard. It always elevates my mood and my energy levels. It also got me out of the neighborhood and exploring trails nearby. I've found lots of things that were hiding right behind some trees. Geocaching is cool.
Also having an additional reason to make lawn work feel "good" is a big win. Now I can mow the grass and cross of both "work out" and "be outside". 

### Reading a Book or Meditate for 10 Minutes
I'm not sure what to do with this one. For one, I was actually already doing 10+ pages of non-fiction reading every day before 75 Hard started. That resulted in [this series of notes](https://gillespedia.com/sources/The+Practice+of+Enterprise+Architecture). I think the intended benefit of 75 Hard's "Read 10 Pages of a non-fiction or self-help book every day" is twofold:

1. Read material that is good for you to know
2. Make time to slow down to engage with something requiring an actual attention span

The first, I think I'm covering by myself. The second, not as much. So, making some time each day to slow down and read something or just sit with my thoughts is probably a good & worthwhile thing to do.

# 36 is an Interesting Number

36 is the first[^1] square triangle number. Meaning, it's the first number you can do this with:

![[459-1.png]]

It's also the sum of the first three cubes:
$$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36$$
It's a highly composite number, divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, & itself. 

36 degrees is 1/10th of a circle.

Oh also I’m 36 years old now. So. Cool. 

Or not.

# Motto: The word "Sasquatch" is somewhere in this sentence, see if you can find it!

I have written a lot about consumer technology lately. This isn't a blog about consumer technology. If you haven't surmised this yet, this isn't a blog about anything at all, really. I just write what I've thought about. To be fair, there is a disproportionate amount of consumer tech running around my thoughts in general. Even right now, as I write this, I have three different reviews for the Nexus 4 open in other tabs. The reviews are generally pretty positive, but contradict each other at places (battery life is bad/good, screen is excellent/just okay). Regardless, I'm getting one as soon as physically possible. I can't wait to make my own photo spheres.

One last thing about Android before I move on: I had one of those mind-blowing moments the other day. Briefly overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness of the technology that I was seeing. I plugged my USB adapter into my Nexus 7. On the other end, I plugged a PlayStation 3 controller. I didn't expect anything to happen. The controller lit up. "The tablet is charging it, cool" I thought. I absent-mindedly picked up the controller and pressed a button. The controller worked. The controller, designed by Sony exclusively for its PlayStation, was recognized and correctly interpreted by my $200 tablet. 10 minutes later, I downloaded Nintendo 64 and Super Nintendo emulators and played video games on my tablet that I hadn't played in years. It was amazing. Google avoids proprietary technology when it can, from what I can see. Android uses the Micro USB charger and NFC simple data sharing standards. Soon it will use the Miracast and Qi wireless charging standards. Compared to a "lightning connector" - it is so much more nerd-zen. I love it.

I'm going to say something controversial right now: I like Kristen Stewart. I think the character she plays in Twilight is a flat, entirely unlikable character. She is just staying true to the material. She might pull that "exasperated I don't know what's going on but I'm stressed" stuff in every movie she's in, but she's hardly the only person in film to do that. Hugh Grant is charmingly befuddled. Clint Eastwood is too cool to open his eyes. Michael Cera (I don't even have to specify an example, he is the same in everything he does).

Plus I think she's an attractive woman, so that helps.

My sister got married this past weekend. I am officially the only Gillespie child still bearing the family name. Traitors. It's up to me to carry it on. Saying that makes me feel way more like a super hero than any mature adult should feel. I guess I'm just not one of those yet. Either way, I'm going to be married at some point in my life, and that's still a strange and foreign concept to me. The first time I heard someone I've always considered a peer say "My wife", it left a weird impression on me. Am I that old?

My computer is on its last legs. I'm glad I'm making money now.

Motto: Balance to the Universe

  
I've been unable to write this column for the past 50 hours since I watched Avengers: Infinity War for the first time. My brain has been trying to comprehend how incredible everything about this movie (and by extension, the franchise as a whole) is. In writing this, I hope to be able to move on a bit to what's next.  
  
Marvel's Cinematic Universe is the single most impressive thing that's ever been done in movies. Sure movies like "Citizen Kane" are better _movies_ \- but that's not as impressive to me as making 19 blockbuster hits in a row over the course of 10 years. 19 consistently good-at-worst movies that tell a compelling continuous story, while being entertaining on their own. If you ask people what the greatest franchise of all time is - they'll probably say Star Wars, James Bond, J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth movies, or Harry Potter... but Marvel so clearly deserves to be at the top of that list. Star Wars is 9 movies over the course of 40 years - only 5-6 of which were good. James Bond was 24 movies over 57 years, about half of which have been good. The Middle Earth Harry Potter was 3 good movies then 1 good movie split out into 3 terrible ones. Harry Potter was pretty good, I suppose.  
  
I'm not going to go on and on about this - but what Marvel has done with this franchise was the most impressive thing I've seen any company do in my lifetime. I am lucky to live in the era that I do. _(Although being born in 2000 would have been cool. It would have been more acceptable for me to love these movies as much as I do, I'd be the same age as Spider-Man, and I'd have had a tablet to play with as a kid instead of an OG Gameboy.)_  
  
Avengers: Infinity War is not the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's not the capstone that sits atop the arch. That will come in a year with the release of the (as of now) untitled sequel followup to Infinity War. At that point, the universe won't be over... but it won't be what it is now. It will have to hit reset in some form or another. At that time I'll re-evaluate how much I want to retain my fandom going forward. Until that day, a Marvel Movie fan I will remain.  
  
AND AS a Marvel movie fan - Avengers Infinity War was positively astounding. As a person - it was the best movie-going experience of my life - topping an experience I had previously written off as being "untoppable" when I watched The Avengers back in 2012\.   
  
Infinity War is a movie that's never been possible before. No other movie has had so much context set up for it... and literally 6+ years of hype built up. All of these disparate elements coming together - having 50+ characters that you already know and care about coming together, developing, meeting each other, working together to a common goal.  
  
This movie showcased 30 characters, paid homage to at least a dozen previous movies, _and_ introduced a new bad guy whose immediately got to be included in every "best bad guys of all time" conversation from this point forward:

Not to mention - Infinity War did all this while being funny, action-packed, emotional, and just downright entertaining. I've never been so thoroughly on the edge of my seat for 2 1/2 hours before. Never before have I seen a movie that felt so important. Only twice before have I ever felt so at awe about something I was watching - and both of those times took place in this same franchise. Never did I think that they'd be able to pull everything off thus far and have it all be so _good_.   
  
I don't want to talk it up too much. I don't want to talk spoilers. I just wanted to say holy cow what a story thus far.  
  
Now I just hope they don't trip over the finish line.

So many cool stunts. The photo from above was in no way representative of the show... it's just that when people where flying through the air on wires, doing wheelies on motorcycles, and doing all sorts of flips and fight scenes I was TOO CAPTIVATED to take pictures.

Motto: Slow pitch straight down the center of the plate

## Marvel

I'm not in the business of writing movie reviews on the Column since I started a podcast that covers that topic pretty thoroughly.

  
That said.

  
Avengers: Endgame is out. I watched it opening night, then again opening morning. It quashed my long held secret belief that I would die by some tragic means before I got to see how the story ended. That superstition hit me pretty much immediately after learning about Marvel's long-term movie plans.  
  
That was seven years ago. Feels like yesterday. That’s the way memory works, though. You remember things that affected you, while smaller things fall by the wayside. I remember opening night of the Avengers. I remember opening night of just about every one of the 22 Marvel movies that have come out. I’ll remember Avengers: Endgame until the day I die. Even if that death isn’t untimely and tragic.   
  
  
Am I wrong to think that the accomplishments of Kevin Feige and Marvel are every bit as impressive as anything else humans have done lately? I'm not going to sit here with a straight face and write "The MCU is equally as impressive as the Moon Landing" - but I am going to point out that both were massive collaborative efforts along a similar timeline. They were both successful. They both changed the landscape of their respective fields (science and movies) forever.  
  
Endgame was fantastic, by the way. For more information on that - [listen to this podcast we recorded about it](https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co/episode/60a343b3ab2e45c6/wsam-bonus-avengers-endgame-review).  
  
I just realized I can direct-link to podcasts we've made. I bet I'll do that more in the future. You're welcome.  

## Tech Love

I love my Samsung Chromebook Plus. I'm officially calling it love now. This is my favorite device I've ever owned... and that's saying a lot. Rather than blather on here, I will use my Top 5 to extol its virtues as a glorious nexus of design and function.

  
Before I get there, though, How can a $400 laptop function every bit as well as my $1200 desktop? How is it that a device with a limited OS can feel so freeing? Again I'll save the specifics for the upcoming red text.
  
  
I recently was bequeathed an Apple Watch by my wife, and it's potentially changed my opinion on iOS and staying in the Apple ecosystem as a whole. Before I got this thing that's strapped to my wrist, I was pretty adamant about my intention to hop back on the Android train at the earliest possible opportunity... but I gotta say, I like this. It feeds into my next major section of this Column quite nicely. I love having the data. I like having the tech closer to me. I miss having a smart watch, and this one is clearly better than the one I used to have. I'm not sure what percentage of the benefits this device has would be equally as good with any of the other platform-independent options that exist out there.

  
Man this stuff is cool.

## Quantified Whole30

So my last post was all about Whole30, but it was almost entirely qualitative. I said I lost 10 pounds, but that was it. Guess what, I HAVE MORE METRICS.  
  
The following comparisons are being drawn between:  
1) The 30 days I spent on a Whole30 diet  
2) The 50 days I've done a Paleo diet  
3) The 1875 days I have recorded on my standard diet (pizza & cheezits)  
  
  
My standard diet has me consuming roughly 2800 calories each day, with a macro ratio of 43C/33F/23P.  
Whole30 dropped by almost a full 1000 calories to 2845, comprised of 24C/49F/28P.  
Paleo is much closer to Whole30 than my standard diet, at 1980 calories, 31C/41F/29P.  
  
Weight wouldn't really be a representative bar chart. I lose weight when I'm eating fewer calories, as you'd expect. The sample size doesn't really allow you to compare apples to apples.  
  
Similarly, my likelihood to exercise is probably not a fair graphic to make. I exercised 15 of the 30 Whole30 days. 50%. On Paleo I tend to exercise slightly less often than that, 13.5 out of every 30 days. Compare both of those to the baseline, 10 out of 30 days, and you see the spillover effect of eating with more discipline into added discipline elsewhere in life.  
  
In terms of how my back feels and how I rate general happiness, both go in the order of:  
  
Standard < Whole30 < Paleo  
  
Albeit the total point swing is less than 10% for both metrics, so I don't know if that's all that telling.  
  
There is one _very_ telling metric, though.  
  
  
I'll caveat that fairly shocking graphic up front and say that Mint (my data source) isn't perfect at categorizing, and sometimes big purchases at stores like Costco will be lumped in with the "grocery" tag. However that's _not_ the case with the 30 Whole30 days I recorded. All the grocery costs were legitimate.  
  
A second, more relevant caveat is that the act of _changing_ a diet is expensive. It's not necessarily that Whole30 is just THAT more expensive than a standard diet, but it's that we incurred a lot of "switching" costs, that would not sustain if we were to eat that way long-term. This is made worse by the relatively small sample size of 30 days. The "already eating this way" effect plays out somewhat by the lower cost of Paleo. We already had supplies to eat Paleo. Both times we've started Paleo, it didn't coincide with a tirade of buying things to support the diet.  
  
I wondered if the higher cost of groceries would be offset by the lower cost of not really eating at restaurants... they weren't. Whole30 is expensive. That benefit-of-the-doubt long-term second caveat I made doesn't even really apply to Whole30, because it is a short-term diet by definition. Those 30 days are going to be expensive. You just have to hope they lead you to a less expensive, more sustainable, healthier-than-before diet.  

## One other note

The other day while researching Apple Watch quantified self apps, I stumbled across a blog that makes this one look like child's play. Mark Koester's "[Minding the Borderlands](http://www.markwk.com/)" has been fascinating me for the past many days. He writes about goals, data, quantification of the self, learning, knowledge, notetaking, among many other things. Do those things sound familiar?  
  
**Except he puts in effort**. Reading his thoughts feels like reading my own thoughts, if I were to actually dedicate the time to reaching their logical conclusions. If you've got any interest at all in any of those things, I really recommend checking it out using the link above.  
  
Top 5: Reasons the Samsung Chromebook Plus is Awesome

5\. Even with their limitations, ChromeOS + Android function very well as a laptop OS. If you want to do something that you can't do using ChromeOS, you're probably better off NOT doing it on a laptop anyway. Provided you've got a desktop PC as backup, there's almost no reason to spend more money for a more capable laptop.  
4\. I love the size of this machine. Not just it's size, but it's aspect ratio. It's almost exactly the size of a spiral bound notebook (see the pictures below), which makes it feel so natural to hold and to write on.  
  
[![](assets/369-1.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HPG2y0LfjcU/XM2adZfXn3I/AAAAAAADxzI/GlLFgoJz2eE0BZuvhe1%5F0NwLgBPBHRepwCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F1876.HEIC)[![](assets/369-2.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W%5FWmj8-rLSo/XM2adQe2KGI/AAAAAAADxzI/2e3G7MgqkTQA%5FLpFrMAo-vk8uHIyrnDXACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F1877.HEIC)  
  
3\. Its built-in stylus functions well enough for anything you want to do. They say the best camera is the on you have on you - to me that truism applies doubly for a stylus.  
2\. The fold-all-the-way-around convertible design is the best form factor for a laptop, _especially_ one with a touch screen. If you flip it past flat, the keyboard stops registering presses - and having the exposed keys has never bothered me. Yet I get constant usage out of this device in all its possible configurations: regular laptop mode, tent mode, face-down-screen-up mode, and in full tablet mode.  
1\. The screen on this device is the best screen in my house. It's bigger than my phone. It's sharper & more vibrant than my 1440p computer monitor.

Motto: The Desolation of Smug

  
This post is going to come across as snooty, maybe, but I don't care. I asked myself a question earlier today: "What are the things that you do that you're really happy about?" which quickly transitioned into "What are things you do that you think everyone should be doing?" Here are my answers. **Establish a System for Passwords** I used KeePass for around a year, but have recently switched to LastPass (100% for convenience's sake). Both services work great and there are many others you could choose. I have all my accounts, passwords, and important reference information in one, easy to reference place. **Why you should:**[I've written about this extensively in the past](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/04/167-feature-password-security.html), so I'm not going to rehash everything. We all know our passwords should be "passsword1" and we all know that we should reuse passwords between services. Using GOOD and UNIQUE passwords on EVERY service is flat out impossible without some sort of management system. There are plenty good ones to choose from: KeePass, LastPass, 1Password, a text file stored in an encrypted zip, a pen and a notebook you keep locked in your desk. Find something encrypted & secure. Also - turn on 2-factor authentication where possible. Your Google account is a good start. Your password manager is even better. **Side benefits include:** seeing a list of all the accounts you have open (which is very handy), the ability to securely store other information along with your passwords - such as account numbers & contact names, the ability to change passwords at will without hassle & memorization. **Create a Personal Inventory** I've got a list of almost everything I own costing more than $100\. It includes pictures, prices, serial numbers, model numbers, dates of purchase, locations of purchase, and usually a couple of other pieces of identifying information. **Why you should:**Disaster recovery. If you came home from vacation to find your house burned to the ground, or was completely ransacked, or destroyed by a flood, or smashed by Cthulhu, could you tell your insurance rep what you owned? If your car goes missing, could you tell the police exactly what your VIN was? Creating a personal inventory takes only a couple to a few hours to begin with, then a minute or two each time you get something new to add to the list. After you've done it, you'll be very glad you have it. **Side benefits include:** Seeing a list of all the things you own (which is very handy), the ability to recall if an item you bought is still under warranty should it malfunction, a rough estimate for how much money you could have if you were really strapped for cash and had to sell everything you owned. **Keep Digital Backups in Multiple Locations** I've got all of my photos, music, documents, and completed video projects stored on my main PC, my main external hard drive, and in a cloud storage service. I keep my PC and cloud storage always up to date and my main hard drive synced around once/month. **Why you should:**Disaster recovery & high availability. Back to the Cthulhu scenario: you've lost everything you own. Your computer is gone. What happens to every photo you've ever taken? What happens to every piece of media you've accrued? What happens to that nice personal inventory you made? If you don't have it backed up in some remote location, you're out of luck. What happens if Google or Dropbox or Apple or Microsoft decide you're breaking their terms of service and lock you out of your account permanently? You'd better have a local copy of everything. More likely scenarios include disk drive failure, accidental deletion, and/or some malicious behavior. **Side benefits include:** Access to all of your files from a remote location, the ability to physically bring all of your files with you on a portable hard drive, and general "sleep better at night"-ed-ness. **Home Media Streaming & Curating a Digital Media Library** Using my phone, I can send music, pictures, movies, or TV shows stored on my computer to my television. I can have one, centrally stored location for all of my media that I can access from anywhere. If I were out in the boonies with all sorts of time to kill, I can still watch Season 1 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. or do an exercise video routine. **Why you should:**Mostly, it's just cool. Your media no longer forced to move your media between different silos. There are tons of ways to do this - I use and would recommend Plex. The process is somewhat cumbersome to setup, but requires virtually no maintenance. Like most things in this list, put in the work once and reap the benefits forever. **Side benefits include:** Media security (not relying on potentially volatile physical media) & impressing people with your cool system. **Cook Your Own Food** Melissa and I cook the majority of our meals. I've not done the leg work to figure out exactly our ratio, but I'd estimate 75-80% of our meals are homemade. **Why you should:**It will save you money and keep you more healthy. On average, the food you pay someone else to make is more fried, more sugary, more salty, or more stuffed with chemicals you can't pronounce than food you'd cook yourself. Also, the $8 lunch you had probably only had $3 worth of ingredients in it and took \~10 minutes to make. **Side benefits include:** A connection to the food you eat, a greater appreciation for food, and attractiveness to a mate.  
  
**Don't Get Unhealthy Foods at the Grocery Store**  
  
I tend to do a pretty good job of "[walking the perimeter](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/health-tip/art-20048842)" of the grocery store. My shopping cart has only a few boxed goods when I leave. It is usually devoid of snacky foods, candies, sodas, and frozen dinners.  
  
**Why you should:**  
You eat what you buy - it's really that simple. You can't expect to live with a healthy diet if you are constantly tempted by the unhealthy food in your pantry. If you keep re-supplying your stash of Nutter Butters (which are delicious, btw) you will never stop eating them.   
  
**Side benefits include:**  
Snacky foods tend to be more expensive than their meat & potatoes counterparts. You'll save money by choosing water over Pepsi, bananas over Doritos. **Exercise Frequently** While I still don't exercise as much as I want to or should, I do get in more than most people. **Why you should:**When you're healthy, everything is better. When you're physically fit, everything is easier. Exercise prolongs life. Exercise prolongs the kind of life you actually want to live. Exercise increases self-esteem, confidence, and general happiness. If you don't exercise as much as you should, you're only hurting yourself. **Side benefits include:** A connection to your body, a greater capacity to do physical work should the need arise, and attractiveness to a mate. **Find Hobbies that Don't come with Continual Expenses** Scenario: I suddenly find myself with a free weekend and nobody around. I can write code, make videos, write Columns, play videogames, cook, and exercise without spending a dollar (not including groceries and the like). Similar scenario: you're hanging out with your friends and you're not all trust fund babies and you need something to do. **Why you should:**If you can't enjoy spending time without spending money then you are in a world of trouble. Find things that are free to do (bodyweight exercises, card games, whatever) or things that come with a modest one-time cost that continually pay off (board games, video games, whatever) and learn to enjoy yourself without draining your bank account. Dominion, Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, Settlers of Catan, video production, photography, pushups, pullups, yoga, drawing, writing, Wikipedia cruising, videogames, cooking, and playing sports are all much better things to do than going out to a bar (IMHO). **Side benefits include:**Enjoying your life. Keeping yourself and your mind active. Bonding with friends. The availability of money for other purposes. **Review Financials Every Night** Well, almost every night. I will check out my list of recent transactions and ensure I can account for each item on the list. Also I will check my budgets for the month. The budget thing I am looking to lean more heavily on. **Why you should:**If you don't stay on top of finances you will find someday that you've been spending all sorts of your money you didn't realize you were... and maybe it wasn't even you that was spending your money. You have to be consciously aware of where you stand at all times on this regard. I feel like this one doesn't really need justification. Use your bank's online site, or use some sort of tool. I use [Mint](https://www.mint.com/). While it's not perfect, it's the best tool I've found.  
  
**Side benefits include:**  
Catching fraudulent purchases early. Keeping yourself and your family out of the financial gutter. **Know Your Tools and How to Use Them** I'm not talking about hammers and saws (unless you own them, then yeah you should know how to use them). I'm talking modern-day tools. I am approaching "power-user" status with my phone & computer. I was once told I have a great appreciation of tools, and I think that still rings true today. **Why you should:**The thing you are reading this on is capable of so many helpful things. If you don't understand how to properly maintain your phone or computer, you are dooming yourself to constant frustrations. "WHY IS THIS SO SLOW?!" Usually there IS an answer to this question. A lack of familiarity with these **Side benefits:**Knowing your tools allows you to better troubleshoot problems, combine clever orchestrations of their usage. I used my phone to create an encrypted drive on my desktop yesterday. It was cool.

------------------------------  
  
I just wrote a listical. I think that means I'm going to make a ton of money now and get shared like crazy on Facebook. That's how the internet works. I'm sorry if this post came across as "holier-than-thou". It's just that I'm so darn holy.  
  
Here's a question I'd like to ask everyone: What do **YOU** do in your life that you're really glad about & think everyone should do?  
  
Here's the picture to go out on:

  
[![](assets/229-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xo2RHzALsnI/VMUcVRWAHCI/AAAAAAABl0M/uQmBglTE53A/s1600/IMG%5F20150123%5F221251.jpg)

Games are fun.  
  
Top 5: **Things I Do That I Think NOT Everyone Should Do** 5\. Trash things heavy-handedly. I can't stand clutter, sometimes to a fault. I don't like not knowing all the cards I hold and what capacity or capabilities those cards give me. This has caused me to, on occasion, throw away things I really should have kept, just for the sake of having less to deal with. 4\. Track **everything** you do. Every exercise. Every bedtime. Every step you take. Everything you eat. A list of 25 goals you try to accomplish every day. I'm glad I do this, but even I recognize it's a bit much. It's definitely not something I'd suggest for everyone. While I would encourage conscientiousness of these things, having the hard data is superfluous for most people. 3\. Go months or even years without reading a book. I don't read for fun nearly often enough. My wife has been doing a fantastic job of this lately, too. 2\. Have a job that involves sitting in a chair all day. 1\. Kiss my wife. I do this, but I don't recommend others do the same.

A nice change of pace from my doomy gloomy Columns as of late. 

# Good News

Lot of pieces of good news happening all around me[^1]. Not the least of which is the holiday season is here. 

## Dis-disabled

I recently amped up my defense against my auto-immune disease and it’s made all the difference. Where there was pain, there is now normalcy. The vague, underlying sense of constant fatigue is no more. It crept in so slowly, and was so consistent, I was hardly even aware it was there most days. Now that it’s gone, it’s obvious it was there. Everyone should be so lucky to experience the feeling of the end of long suffering. Getting out of bed and beginning the day without a grim reminder of your mortality and decline into decrepitude is… it’s unlike anything else. There is no comparison.

But, like a dog with a very hard life who's adopted from a shelter by a loving family who treats him right, I am so nervous to grant myself permission to feel like everything is going to be alright. The future is unknown. For now, I’m just loving the ability to move around and exercise again. 

In case it gets lost in all the other contexts in this post, the Quote is in reference to this section of the Column.

# Lengthening Loops & Parenthood

Life as a parent of 2 young children is a series of loops. A series of the same types of events happen over and over, bookended by sleeps. The length of the loops increases with the age of the children. 

When you have a newborn the cycle is happening 6+ times a day. Feed. Soothe. Play. Try to do stuff while they’re asleep. 

As the baby ages into toddlerhood, the cycle extends out to 2 a day. Wake. Breakfast. Get ready for the day. Find stuff to play with. Try to sneak in things you want to do (or need to do) when they aren’t actively requiring your full attention. Then a nap happens around mid-day. Upon wake, you get a slightly different flavor of the exact same loop to finish the day.

Parenthood is everything I expected it to be. It’s easily the hardest thing I do, but also the most rewarding. It’s a blessing. It’s a curse. Becoming a parent is the biggest change I’ve experienced in life. I look forward to the future, but also know I’ll miss these days when they’re gone. I can still hold both my boys at the same time, but I reckon this time next year that won’t be possible.

# 2022 in Review

In my [2021 → 2022](https://aarongilly.com/415/) I said “2021 ⇒ 2020 All Over Again?” I struggle to say 2022 didn’t feel like more of the same. Things obviously did happen and change. We all got a year older. My elder child started to truly become self-sufficient for some basic things. My younger learned to talk. My wife took a new job here in Lawrence and I took a new role at my job. We borrowed a car for the better part of a year while ours was being built. We became among the first people we know to own a fully-electric vehicle. I spent about half the year in the worst flare up I’ve ever had, which may be the story of the year. The day-to-day, though, felt like more of the same. 

This isn’t a *bad* thing, per se. I’m very much living the life I chose and intentionally crafted with my family. See all of the above. 

The only truly “new” thing this year was the creation of [https://getinto.win](https://getinto.win) - which isn’t really “new” as much as it is a crystallization of a project that combines nearly all of my hobbies and talents.

## Goals and Results

I set slightly more moderate goals for 2022 than I had in 2021. The goals I set for myself were less well-defined, fewer in number, and explicitly ‘softer’. 

### Last Year’s Non-SMART Goals

**More time listening to music, less to podcasts** - I don’t think I made any changes. I’ve got a podcast in my ear literally as I write this. I’m very bad at realizing when I am and am not paying attention to something. In short: 🔴

**Re-establish the hardcore use of Streaks on iOS** - No analysis needed. I absolutely failed. 🔴

**Hone my work systems** - This one is hard. While I definitely *tried* to do this, I very much failed to create a “good” work system. Instead I spent so many cycles starting from scratch saying “this didn’t work”. Nothing ever took hold. 🔴

**Build the next-generation Life Tracker and integrate in the old versions’ data** - The Personal Data Warehouse exists. It was wholly built anew in 2022. It, however, doesn’t have any of the old versions’ data in it. On the whole: 🟡

## Report Card

| Area | Goal | Result | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eating Out | Less than 2x/week | 🟡 107  | Did better than I expected. |
| Exercise | Exercise more times than eating out | 🟡 86 (cardio x 27, mobility x 9, strength x 50) | Given my back kept me from exercising at all most of the year, this is a pretty good result |
| Notes | 150 new notes | 🟢 266 new notes | Despite feeling like I never touch these, I clearly am. |
| Books | 26 read | 🟡 Started 30, only finished 22. | Need better books. |
| Movies | 26 new movies | 🟢 29 new movies + 6 rewatches  |  |
| Columns | >6 | 🟢 13 | My goal here is basically “just don’t stop being a writer” |

# 2023 Themes, Goals, and Ambitions

## 2023 Themes

My overall themes to focus on going into 2023:

- More wood, fewer arrows.
- Use what you have & don’t start from scratch.
- To be venturesome.

I’m going to archive some of the projects I’ve been actively (or intermittently) working on. Specifically, I’ll be putting an indefinite hiatus on doing the Creation of the Week, Gillespedia, 30 Day Challenges, and 

## 2023 Goals

Some quantified goal's I'll report back on in ~365 days.

**Eating Out** - fewer than 125 times

**Exercise** - greater than 150 times

**Notes** - another 150 new notes

**Books** - finish another 18 books

**Movies** - watch 30 new (to me) movies

## 2023 Ambitions

I am going to see if I can leverage the “[Streaks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692)” app to manage my day-to-day maintenance activities to free my mind for larger and more fun ambitions. Day trips. Pushing the existing ideas & projects further. Not settling for “what's easy”.



# Top 5: Best Movies I Watched in 2022



## 5. Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers

My name is Dale. I don't eat whale. Why would you say that I eat whale? 



## 4. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent

Amazing premise. Amazing man. 



## 3. Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness

I'm a sucker for Marvel, and yet this is the only MCU Movie of the 3 candidates that made this list.



## 2. The Menu

Suspense & Dark Comedy. Go in blind. It's brilliant. 



## 1. Everything Everywhere All at Once

One of my Top 10 Favorite movies of all time.

# Motto: Rubber ducky, you're the one..

This is my 47th column since its rebirth. I should emphasize again that this is not the 47th column I've ever written - it's likely closer to the 300th (I had a lot of free time in high school). All those columns are gone now - lost to the grandeur of the greater internet. I'm archiving these posts however, so that won't ever happen again. So this is the 47(+/-300)th column.  The number 47 has a greater significance in my life. First off, it was my favorite number for a long time (the number 42 surpassed it after I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but that's another story - one I told 5 columns ago). The reason it was my favorite number is because of its relevance to one of my favorite video games series of all time: Hitman.  Videogames are for children. Videogames are not for adults with problems to deal with and responsibilities to attend to. But, as I have often said, I'm only as mature as I have to be in any given situation. If I properly manhandled my responsibilities for the day, there isn't much maturity warranted for that night. You can bet there's a chance I'll fire up the old PlayStation.   In high school I played through the second, third, and forth Hitman games (the first was PC-only, and is widely viewed as not being the first GOOD one). 6 1/2 years went by until last week, Hitman: Absolution was released. I played through and beat it in a shamefully short amount of time. The only saving grace I have is that I didn't do it entirely alone; I found a way to be sociable during said course.  The premise of the games (and movie, don't forget there was a movie) is simple: you are a clone that was made from the DNA of four bad guys. You have no proper name, but were given the moniker "47" because you were the 47th clone in the series. You are a hitman. You get paid to sneak around and kill people. The game takes patience, observational skills, foresight, precision, creativity, and general brain power. It is very serious in tone, but is also host to some tongue-in-cheek humor. My favorite such example is the reoccurance of a rubber ducky throughout the series. The duck even makes an appearance in the movie (when I saw it, I giggled like an idiot).  47 is the reason I had a rubber duckie on display in my room throughout college.

In celebration of column 47

I have been thinking about other things lately, too.  Hear me out.  I don't like Facebook. I have Facebook; but I don't use Facebook. I have only kept a Facebook because it seemed 'selfish' of me to delete my Facebook. It is, as you know, the place that people I don't get to talk to on a regular basis would check up on me and my life. It is how they would connect with me. The thing is, I DON'T USE Facebook. So, there isn't REALLY a connection there. There are no updates about me and my life. I don't see them or what's new in theirs either. What's worse is that it gives the illusion of a connection. It allows relationships to be held idly. You don't have to put any work into being someone's Facebook friend. You don't have to maintain the friendship at all... they are just there. They are on Facebook. This is BAD. This not the way friendships were meant to be. Social media should AUGMENT social lives, but, for some people, it has almost completely replaced them.  Being on Facebook, I get invited to dozens of events on any given month (not to brag). Out of these dozens of events, there's maybe MAYBE 2 that I'm actually interested in. There are a few problems here: People assume that I've seen the invite to "whatever", so they don't tell me about "whatever". Then when I find out and don't go, people say "well it was on Facebook". The second problem is this - even if I WAS on Facebook, I had become sign-blind to events. I saw so many of them, I started only seeing them as "events" instead of seeing what they actually were. The thing would say "You have 4 events" and I would go "Cool, I need to delete these 4 things to make that red number go away". Then I would delete them. Without even looking. If I got, say, ONE or TWO event invites a month, I'd probably have paid more attention... but that's not the case. I was getting friendship spammed. Then I realized, that's what Facebook has become to me. Spam.  It's a hollowed-out husk of the fun thing it used to be years ago. It's become an obligation. 80% of the posts on Facebook I don't care about because I'm friends with every person I've ever met and they post everything they've ever done. My 7th grade teacher ate half a sandwich and dropped the other half on the floor! Awesome!  It is for those reasons (and many others that I didn't get into to save you all time), that I have decided to delete my Facebook account. It's been hanging on like by a dead, lifeless thread for quite some time now. But I'm done with it.  I'm also going to dial waaaay down the amount of my time that I dedicate to Reddit. I have free time now that I don't have homework. I need to find things to do with it that are more conducive to a full life. 

# Top 5: Alternative sources for the things Facebook is supposed to provide 
5. Private investigators (I'm making a joke about Facebook creeping, if that's not obvious) 
4. Google+ (if you call me hypocritical for thinking Google+ is okay but Facebook isn't, I'll retort with an hour long argument that you may or may not agree with... so let's just... let's not go there). 
3. Having a blog. 
2. Phone calls, emails, text messages, various chat protocols. 
1. Actually going to see and talk with people.

# Motto: Thunder Buddies for Life

First off, I feel its necessary to give you an idea of what is going on right now:
I'm not doing anything.

Now that you're up to speed, I would like to get started. I hung out with my cousins this weekend. We have grown up together, as evidenced by the following (awesome) picture.
 
![us](assets/16-1.jpg)

For those who don't know, the picture above depicts, from left to right, a future medical doctor, professional engineer, and police officer. It also depicts three very white guys.

I like the show "Holmes Inspection" on HGTV. The fact that I like any show on HGTV means I'm getting older. I think that other signs of my aging would make a wonderful top 5. Look forward to that.

I am switching my EDC tablet from my Transformer to a Nexus 7 tablet. The Nexus 7 is a seven inch tablet, purely Google. It is lighter and smaller than the Transformer. It won't take up as much space in the bag (I love that bag) and won't fatigue the shoulder as much after a long day.

Ted is like a long, live-action Family Guy. That's a good thing. I mean, it worked.

Staying with my parents tends to make me revert to the habits I had when I was in high school. I feel like an entirely different person. It's not necessarily a good thing. I'm lazier. I am less healthy. I need to go back to Lawrence. I have drank 3 Mountain Dews in the past 3 days. That represents sodas number 2, 3, and 4 this year. I don't like that trend.

# Top 5: Personality changes that show I'm getting older
5. I like a show on HGTV
4. I like getting up early
3. I think "man, I shouldn't eat that" every so often
2. I'm looking forward more to the Olympics than the X-games
1. I want a place of my own, a dog, and I embrace my coming stability

# Motto: If pictures are worth 1000 words, this is a REALLY long column


I am jetlagged. I've been going through a weird cycle of sleeping for 13 or 14 hours, then staying awake for 24 straight without the slightest hint of tiredness. I'm working on correcting that.

During my many periods of unwilling wakefulness I have been perusing photos on my computer. I've decided there are a few fun ones I'd like to share with you, my loyal readers*. I'm going to try to keep the entertainment value high with these.

*Mom.

ONE NOTE BEFORE WE GET STARTED:
I'd like to explicitly state that you have the option to click on the pictures to make them bigger. Doing this allows you to quickly look through all the photos in any post - but loses you the ability to see their captions and any surrounding context... which is usually fairly important.

We are going to work our way backward in time.

First off, today I already toured KC some and took some new photospheres. I got a tripod mount for my cell phone, it takes photosphere quality to the next level. See below:

Next, I took a special tour of Boulevard's brewery yesterday:

From the roof of the Brewery... I don't like that guy

![](assets/80-5.jpg)

The whole group (everyone knew everyone, or at least everyone knew Nick)

![](assets/80-6.jpg)

Again, the tripod makes these way better

Two days ago the Fuller's hosted Poker Night (I'm capitalizing that because it's the name of a movie that's coming out soon):

![](assets/80-7.jpg)

Danielle got a new cat & AJ in in the process of hitting me in the crotch

![](assets/80-8.jpg)

I think this photo explains itself

Next, here are a couple photos from the trip:

"Huh?"

![](assets/80-10.jpg)

Me attempting a stereotypical girl-trying-to-look-sexy-without-"trying" pose

Right after this one I got called "terrible at jump photos"

Now we'll move on to photos from earlier this year:

![](assets/80-13.jpg)

Melissa's sister Krista, a little less psyched to get the Yeti hat

This picture also explains itself
Stepping back a year - here are some interesting photos from 2012:

I think I'm a big fan of this photo of Melissa

One more step back - 2010:

Melissa and I found an igloo

The fact this thing exists proves the world isn't perfect

This picture explains itself

I love my friends
One last step back - these photos come from a desk shift of Melissa's from before we started dating (I joined her at the desk because I liked her... but she didn't know that yet):

![](assets/80-26.jpg)

They are all like this

![](assets/80-27.jpg)

We were destined to fall for each other

![](assets/80-28.jpg)

Looking back at these, there was an awful lot of "head on shoulder"... she totally digged me

![](assets/80-29.jpg)

We still do this sort of stuff more than any two responsible adults should

# Motto: Two days ago, I was 23. Then I was 24. I aged one year in a day.

Yesterday was my birthday. A few friends of mine helped another friend of mine move from Lawrence to Kansas City. The trip up there was hot and windy and stressful. We lost a pillow out of the back of the truck (not entirely my fault), but otherwise had no casualties. The rest of this story will be told in bullet-point fashion:

We relaxed in the air conditioner.
We ate Minsky's pizza.
We held the first meeting of my secret society that has been held in probably a year. Nobody knows that but me.
We threw marshmallows into each other's mouths.
We eventually built a slingshot and started using it instead of throwing them.
We walked around a really nice apartment building.
We were denied access to the pool or the movie theater room on account of them being previously engaged. 
We got lost (mildly lost) driving around looking for a convenience store. 
We saw what is apparently "the bad part of town".
We were asked to give a man money so he could get a "drank".
We politely declined.
We hung out in the apartment building's "game room". 
We played pool. 
We watched the Olympics.
We retired for the night.
We slept in love seats/chairs/on the floor.
Overall, it was a great birthday by any standard. I had a very good night.

A+. Would do again.

In other news:

I move in 3 days. My girlfriend comes home from Indiana in a week. I am 98% sure I'm going to Los Angeles in 3 weeks. My girlfriend goes to Thailand for 5 months in 5 months.


Lastly...

Last column I talked about not knowing what a real-world goal for my physique would look like. I said I would be happy with the dude who played Colossus in X-Men. Watching the Olympics, I stumbled across a better one. The men's 200m backstroke champion, Matt Grevers is who I saw.

![](assets/22-1.jpg)
(Editor's note from 2020: I got close to this at my peak I'd guess? Oh God have I peaked? You're more likely to peak **after** having 2 kids, right?)

Dude is my height and 20 pounds heavier than me. This is what 20 pounds of muscle would look like. That's where I'm aiming.

Expect me to recreate that picture with perfect accuracy at some point in time in the next 5 months.

This is a good one, broh.

# Health is Dynamic

If you feel like you’re not as healthy as you’d like to be, give yourself a break.  
It’s hard.  
I’ve never done it.  
Despite what [I myself have said on this very blog](https://aarongilly.com/402/#5-health) - what is “*healthy*” is so incredibly dynamic that it is pretty forgivable to be overwhelmed by or confused by what the “right” thing to do is. Everything (EVERYTHING) is situation-dependent, and no one thing works best in all situations. 

As they say:  
> There is no ‘best move’ in chess.

## Consumption Curve

Short of cyanide[^1], the health impact of every single thing you consume looks like this:

![[442-1.png]]

The height, width, and offset-from the Y axis of that distribution varies immensely from food-to-food, drink-to-drink, person-to-person, and is confounded by seemingly infinitely many other factors that you *cannot* pull out in any real-world setting. What’s more - this curve isn’t unique to the things you put into your body, it also perfectly describes what you **do** with it. 

- No exercise leads to bad health outcomes, and so does constant exercise without rest.
- No water kills you, but people have also died from drinking too much.
- One M&M is fine. M&Ms for dinner - not so much.

As they say:  
> The dose makes the poison.

## Applied to Meals

All of that was preamble to what I wanted to say here - it sucks there is no such thing as an infinitely repeatable recipe that scores well along these dimensions.

![[442-2.png]]

If things were easy, there would be some sort of miracle Goldilocks food that maxes out every single dimension:

![[442-3.png]]

But no such food exists. Worse, because **health is dynamic**, things aren’t always consistent:

![[442-4.png]]

As you move across the consumption curve, you cross the critical point where additional consumption produces **less** healthy results. As you saturate the palate they get less tasty, too.

So this puts us in a state where we need to constantly vary what we eat, which is not easy if you’re cooking for yourself and not cheap if you’re eating out. 

It’s an impossible task to maintain high marks across all four dimensions over time. The best thing you can do is try to balance which dimension(s) you’re sacrificing for any given meal or snack. Eat at an expensive but healthy restaurant one day, then have bagged popcorn the next. Make yourself a full meal from scratch later. Then eat a simple but bland salad. 

As they[^2] say:  
> Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

## Embrace the Struggle

So it's impossible to win all the time, and no one approach will get you there. Is that depressing? No. It’s just *complicated*. Finding your way through those complications and achieving intermittent success is *rewarding*. 

It’s satisfying to cook a great, healthy meal. It’s fulfilling to complete a good, hard workout. It’s exciting to find a new recipe that produces tasty results quickly. It’s delightful when you discover some new thing that saves time or money on food. It’s thrilling to set a new PR.

If healthy living was a “solved” problem, then we’d get bored with it.

Life’s a struggle, but there’s meaning in the struggle. Everything that exists can have some level of appreciation if you’re willing to *put in the work to appreciate it*. 

As they[^3] say:  
> To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.

# The Best Kids Show

I'm not about to blaze[^4] a new trail, this is a common opinion. The best kids show, bar none is Bluey.

![[442-5.png]]

This fictional family of blue heelers from Australia have taught me and my family real-world, real **valuable** lessons - and made us laugh while it was doing it. My kids see themselves in Bluey and Bingo and the fantastical games they come up with. My wife and I see ourselves in Bandit and Chilli and how they support their children and each other.

One of the biggest lessons I’ve taken away from Bluey is that it’s not only *possible* but also *my obligation as a father* to put in the effort to **find the fun in time I spend with my kids**. Often times, that’s easy. Being around them and simply observing what they’re doing can be quite fun; but *simply observing* them and tending to their obvious needs is not enough. There is a deeper level of happiness and satisfaction that you can get to as a parent, one that will strengthen your relationship with your kids and give them the chance to experience the magic of childhood - if only you’re willing to put in the work.

As they say:  
> …Mom! …Dad! …Bingo! …Bluey!

## Effortless vs Effortful Fun

Some things in life are simply fun. Eating ice cream, going real fast on a ride. These are *pleasurable*. 

Some things in life take a lot of effort to make fun, or only become fun after the fact. Doing a hard workout, solving a problem. These are *enjoyable*.

There's a difference between "pleasure" and "enjoyment". We *typically* enjoy pleasure, but **not everything we enjoy is pleasurable - nor is every pleasure enjoyed**. A hard night’s work producing a new piece of art may not be very pleasure-filled, but it could be quite enjoyable. Meanwhile a beer, drunken hastily while we focus on problems at work or the bad call a ref just made - although pleasurable, may not be enjoyed at all. **We are predisposed to seeking pleasure, even when it doesn't bring about enjoyment.** It's a flaw in the human condition.

Bluey has made me realize this *in practice*. I have put in the work. I have gotten off my phone and played games where I was controlled by a magic asparagus, or I was the claw machine grabbing them their own stuffed animals from off my lap, or I rolled balls after them as they jumped out of the way just in time, Raiders of the Lost Ark style. 

Every time I do it, it’s work. 

Every time I manage to do it, I’m so glad I did.

As they[^5] say:  
> Enjoyment is cultivated. It's more difficult, but infinitely more worth your while.

## Conclusion/Callout

Even if Bluey didn’t offer up life lessons, it would be worth the price of admission simply because it’s *funny*. My 2 and 5 year old laugh at parts. I laugh at other parts. Often we’re all laughing together.

Who cares if it’s the popular opinion - Bluey is incredible. I will fight you about this. 

Specifically you, ***Nick***. 

You’re wrong and you should feel bad about your wrong opinion.

# Motto: I've got nothing to say - but I'm going to say a lot

It's been several columns since I've written about Google - so it's probably about that time. I'll end the section about Google with some bold text so you can skip it if you aren't interested.

Google announced "Keep", a lightweight notetaking app. When I first found out, I had really really high hopes. They were quickly let down, though. The service is way more lightweight than I had anticipated. There is no options for basic categorization or rich text formatting - let alone any of the more advanced features I was hoping for. After the initial letdown, though, I decided that the service wasn't all bad. Adding notes and looking through the notes you have is SUPER fast. It's easily faster than any other note-taking client I've tried (and I've tried all the popular ones).

Basically, I expected a binder with a few neatly organized notebooks in it and got some post-it notes instead. Useful, but different.

Another bit of Google-related news - for a long time now (read: a few months) there has been rumors that Google was working towards a unified messaging service. Currently, Google hosts Messenger, Talk, Hangouts, Email, and text messages all under different roofs (unless you have Google Voice as your primary phone, you could have gotten everything but messenger from gmail.com - but almost nobody has that). Anyway - rumor has it that this new service will possibly be named "Babble" and will be announced in May during Google I/O. I sincerely hope the first rumor is false and the second rumor is true. I look forward to what I have called in the past "A grand unification of technology".

Google's Coverage of march madness has been stellar. This is a screencap of the "March Madness Bracket":

![](assets/73-1.png)

You can skip to here if you are technologically apathetic.

Speaking of March Madness:

![](assets/73-2.jpg)

If I had just picked the OPPOSITE of what I picked, I may have done better.

26 definitely incorrect picks. 20 definitely correct picks. 22 games up in the air.

I have been thinking about my immune system a lot lately. The metaphor I can't get out of my head is that my body is a fort - surrounded by a wall (skin) with millions of trained soldiers (white blood cells) defending the sanctity therein. The soldiers generally do a good job. I went 7 or 8 months without a down day until two weeks ago, when a Trojan Horse was parked outside of the walls of the castle. The soldiers weren't trained for large wooden horses and did the dumbest thing possible. The horse was let in. That night, the virus leapt from the belly of the beast. Once inside, the sacked and plundered heavily as my little trained soldiers fought with all their might. Eventually, the flu was stricken from the castle (I got tired of calling it a fort) and normalcy returned to the villagers (I got tired of calling it a castle)... but the history books will forever show that the flu once had it's day.

But the metaphor continues - 

I have a mole in my army - in training division. The soldiers are being trained to attack my temple (I got tired of calling it a village) they were created to protect. There's a medication keeps those overzealous fighters in check - if, you know, you don't get the flu and miss a dose of a medication you only take once every two weeks. 

Having just said that - I got some practice with Photoshop today. It was the first measurable step I took towards my ultimate goal of making awesome movie posters. I had never used photoshop before - but I'm proud to say I think I picked it up pretty alright. I went from zero experience to this picture within 100 minutes:

![](assets/73-3.png)+photoshop+Alternate.png)

About that left eye - it's going to be taken care of. Don't freak out.

Time to go - the KU Game is on.

Oh hi.

# I'm so busy. I just don't have any time.

Those are complaints I have despised hearing for years. Even in college, I used to sit around and think about how **easy** it must be to be an aged individual with a regular job and not have 2-3 hours of homework[^1] each night. People who complained about how busy they were must have been just wasting their time.

Like almost every other belief and opinion I once held, this general disdain for complaints of "being busy" has gotten a lot more complicated with the benefit of perspective. 

What *remains* is the belief that in nearly every case I have experienced, people who complain about how busy they are brought >50% of their "business" onto themselves. 

- Signing up for additional work.
- Buying things they don't need that they then need to maintain.  
- Joining groups or taking up hobbies that eat up what would otherwise be "free time".

Complaining about being busy is the same thing as complaining about choices your former self made and the continuing choice you make every day to stay the course. But also, when I hear those complaints I hear a general dissatisfaction with life.

Life is busy. It's all we do. *'You either get busy living or get busy dying'*, they say. People who complain about being busy are really complaining about not being happy with the things they are busy with. And if you *chose* those things, then I don't really think you're entitled to legitimate grievance. 

All that said - I'm now aware of what some people meant when they say they don't have time any more. It's an accumulation of marginal gains (or losses, I suppose).

## Going Places

It used to be if I had to go somewhere I would just *go*. 

1. Phone ✅
2. Wallet ✅
3. Keys ✅

Now, simply "going somewhere" has become something partway between an elegant dance and sweating tactical details like it were wartime and we were about to go behind enemy lines. 

1. Phone ✅
2. Wallet ✅
3. Keys ✅
4. 3 year old ✅
5. 3 year old has peed recently ✅
6. 3 year old has snack and drink ✅
7. 3 year old has toys ✅
8. 11 month old ✅
9. 11 month old diaper clean ✅
10. 11 month old diaper and wipes ✅
11. 11 month old back up outfit ✅
12. 11 month old snacks ✅
13. 11 month old teether and/or toys ✅
14. Car seats ✅
15. Stroller ✅

Yeah I didn't really think about much of any of that back when I was going through college. Nor did I consider the other litany of general "adult" things that hadn't **really** kicked in for me just yet. It was *smooooooooth* sailing after I graduated, almost certainly.

And yet every year continues to be the best one I've had in my life. I'm not too busy *for* life, I'm busy actively doing it. The struggle is remembering the struggle is all there is, and not to struggle with it. 

## "Things are just Crazy Right Now"

A common follow-on of the sentence "I'm so busy - I just don't have any time" is "things are just crazy right now". This sentiment is one I've grown increasingly skeptical of in the past few years. It's been "just a crazy time" for as long as I can remember... and if you can't remember when it was "normal" instead of "crazy right now because of circumstances x, y, and z", then *maybe crazy **is** normal*. It's a justification, an excuse, to *not* do something someone should, or to be doing something someone shouldn't. It's just a crazy time right now.

But who am I to judge. Sorry if I'm coming across as 'moody' - it's a just a crazy time right now.

# Home Improvement

Grunt noise.

![pantry](assets/413-1.png)

One of the litany of reasons I haven't written a post in two full months is that every spare moment I've had has been dedicated to other priorities. Chiefly among them is making rapid and pervasive changes to the house we moved into. After not changing our previous house until we'd lived there 5 years, we decided to make our new house feel like "ours" much more quickly by making everything about it intentionally to suit our needs and wants. We both refuse to grow complacent to those little things we didn't immediately love about the new house. Things we never really got around to in the old house. Great example: I'm painting the gym ceiling. Never did that at the old place in five years. Did it here after two months.


The [Diderot Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect) is in Full Force.


See the Top 5s.

# Other Stuff

## Baby Height

Why is it that 95% of the babies I know are at or above the 95th percentile in terms of height? Did they measure a sample size of 12 kids, from exclusively undernourished families? Or did they change the height (length, really) measurement technique? Or is my friend group really the parents of giants (as we are, too)?

## Balance

A very powerful man once said perfectly balanced is how "all things should be". Family. Maintenance. Hobbies. Work. I feel like those are the general dimensions by which I could break down my resource spend. I reckon those all break down into subcategories that themselves need to be balanced and maintained.

Anyway mine has been wholly out of whack for the past couple months. It's crazy. [This article](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/commitment-inventory) from the (genuinely awesome) Doist Blog comes to mind.



# Top 5: Home Improvements Completed Since My Last Update



## 5. Fixed the Lighting in the Office, Entryway, & Hallway

Replaced a single, way-too-low-for-my-comfort fan with recessed lighting as a small scale test for future recessed lighting projects. Also replaced a couple light fixtures with ones that are about 20x as bright. 



## 4. Began a Massive Re-coloring Project

We are going from tans and browns to whites and greys. This started with a couple test door replacements & painting the fireplace white.



## 3. Overhauled the Garage

Removed everything from the walls. Fixed holes in the walls & ceiling. Primed and painted. Installed new outlets. Hung the bikes



## 2. Overhauled the Pantry

Replaced sagging shelves with better shelving with supports. Painted everything white and added integrated motion-activated hidden lighting.



## 1. Overhauled the Gym

Added rubberized flooring. Painted the unfinished wall and ceiling flat black. Replaced single, middle of the room bulb on its own circuit with a series of light bars all tied to the switch. Created a new dumbbell rack with integrated mirrors. Also got new gym equipment to complete my "home gym of my dreams". I'd show a picture, but there's truly 1 or 2 more small things to do (more mirrors!)



# Top 5: Home Improvements Yet to Go



## 5. Install Recessed Lighting in Most Places

Cause it's great.



## 4. Finish an Office Overhaul

French CLEATS. Test cleats are up & holding white boards, but they need painted and generally fixed up.



## 3. Replace All Doors

2 1/2 down, 7 1/2 to go.



## 2. Recolor Essentially Everything

Everything but the kitchen.



## 1. Redo the Master Bath... Maybe Completely

The master bath is bigger than our old one, but has several imperfections that I'd like to iron out. Might even knock down a wall in there... we'll see.

Most of my posts lately have been about big topics or ideas. Most things aren't big, though. Most things are little. Here are some little things.

# Being Wrong

I pride myself on my ability to be wrong. I'm quite talented at it. I am wrong *frequently*. More importantly, I freely and fully admit to wrong. I own up to it. It's how you grow as a person and learn. I am not so naïve as to think Aaron today has everything figured out and I'll more or less be the exact same person in 15 years (I imagine I'll probably be quite different within 15 *months*). Times change. New facts and insights are gathered. People grow.

Recently, I realized I was wrong.

On this topic, not only was I wrong, but my wife was even more *right* than I realized. Now I see the light.

## The Weekend

What was I wrong about? It's "the weekend", not "the weekends". 

That one little "s" makes all the difference. My whole life I've seen monthly calendars where the week starts on a Sunday. Sunday is the left-most column. Then you get the week. Then you hit Saturday. Sunday was one weekend, Saturday was the other end. Sunday and Saturday are the week *ends...* as in **both** **ends** of the week.

But this is BLATANTLY wrong. **The first day of the week is Monday**. It's the obvious way to do things. It's how the world works, for one, and beyond that - look at how the days of the week are named... 

MON → rhymes with → ONE

TUE → obviously → TWO

WED → turn that W on its side → 3

THUR → two letters away from → FOUR

And the last 3 all start with the correct letter:

FRI → FIVE

SAT → SIX

SUN → SEVEN

I was an idiot. Now I'm still an idiot, but slightly better on this topic. That world-view has served me well.

# Alignment

Melissa and I met in 2009 as two very different people. We've both changed and grown a **ton** in the subsequent 11 years. Lately more than ever we're finding interests that overlap. It's pretty awesome. I think we've both seen great success in things the other has done and we've both pushed each other. 

### Examples

Just a few.

- I'm playing guitar most nights. I still suck so don't get excited.
- Melissa has been knee-deep in Notion.
- We're both into minimalism and doing things *less but better*.

# Site Updates

I added some stuff to [the home page of this site](https://www.aarongilly.com) - adding some new "Secondary Features":

Probably nothing more needs to be said that what's contained in that picture.

# Google Apps Script IDE Upgrade

Hey reader. You can probably just skip to the next major heading. 

Google Apps Script, the coding environment that allows you to play around with Google's main applications using JavaScript & host WebApps got a MASSIVE upgrade this week. I'm excited.

Basically I learned how to write JavaScript using the old Google Apps Script Integrated Development Environment... and that's quite a feat because it was, to be nice, not on par with any other IDE out there. Even the Visual Basic for Applications editor behind Microsoft's Office lineup was better, and that's a low, low bar to clear.

Anyway the new editor looks to have most of the basic niceties that anyone with experience in a modern IDE would come to expect. Things like finding where variables or functions were defined, seeing Intellisense-like auto-complete suggestions that actually tell you what they are, code folding, and a right-click menu. It's also supposedly faster and easier to debug & deploy things in the new environment. I can't wait to get my hands on it and start tinkering around.

## Question of the Month

I think I got Incepted recently. Someone slipped into my dream and whispered "hey... you should do all your tracking stuff all differently." This is a common occurrence.

Should I continue to build out my Data Journal using Glitch + MongoDB? Or should I use AWS? Or should I go back to Google Sheets & Apps Script? Or Google Cloud & Firebase? Or a cloud PosgreSQL provider? Or go all-in on Airtable? Or just wait for the Notion API to open up?

...or...  
...or...  
...or...

Ultimately, I just need a consolidated place to store data of a certain type over time, to query those data, and aggregate them in various ways. Basically I'm standing up my own personal data warehouse. How about that?

It's all overkill. You don't **need** to do anything nearly that complicated to get a massive amount of value from this sort of exercise. See my Top 5 below for more. What I *want* to do is make **something** that can be helpful for people other than me. Whether that's providing a turn-key solution, or providing a really well-thought-out starting point for other people with some level of coding experience to pick up on... I don't know.

The neat part is, I know I'm capable of delivering either.

# Apple Fitness+ First Impressions

*Disclaimer: I've done only 3 Apple Fitness+ workouts, and all of them have been half-hour yoga sessions. I'm also wholly incompetent and nobody should trust me. Enough CYA?*

## The Good

The on-screen heart rate & ring progress are cool. The app integration with the watch is seamless and make the whole experience neat. I like the idea that they have different varieties of workout that allow you to filter by workout type and duration. I like the workout types they have. It's a good cross-section of "fitness". They also work well with what are some of the most common pieces of at-home gym equipment.

## The Meh

I get that Peloton is a big huge success and that Apple is basically just mimicking them here with the bicycling, rowing, and treadmill workouts... but what I don't get is why *either* of them are successful. I've never tried it, so I clearly have no ground to stand on. From an outsider's perspective, though, the workout videos would just be a trainer saying:

### Rowing

"Alriiiiiight and row! and row! and row! now let's row! and row! hey it's time to row!".

### Cycling

"Alright let's cycle fast! CYCLE FAAAST PUMP THOSE LEGS! Okay here's a little flat spot we can all take a short break and FAAAAAST OH MY GOODNESS LET'S BIKE!"

### Treadmill

"Okay let's set our speed at 7mph and go. Left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot..."

I'm sure that's not what it is. But that's what I like to picture. The "meh" is purely a matter of taste.

## The Bad

Here's the real gripes with Apple Fitness+ thus far.

### TV

I don't have an Apple TV (like most people). So I'm stuck watching a workout video on an iPad propped near the TV. That's dumb.

### "Working Out" vs "Training"

The workouts are all independent. They are meant to be accessed at random and performed in any order. This is *good* from an ease-of-entry perspective, but it also makes me feel like the whole thing is haphazard. You're not "building" on anything if any given workout could be somebody's 1st workout ever.

### Difficulty

Unless I'm missing something, there's no quick and easy way to determine how *difficult* a given workout is. You can preview the video some, but I find that to be mildly helpful at best. So you sort of just, jump in, and hope it's around your level. And, thus far, I've not found anything even close to what I'd "ideally" use.

The 3 yoga sessions I've done I'd classify as "probably too easy", "definitely too easy", and "holy cow this isn't doesn't even count as a workout". I'm not a yogi or anything, but I don't need an *"introduction to downward dog"* again. I'm well acquainted. I get it. Let's go.

# Top 5: Things I Recommend Tracking


## 5. Pain


Where do you hurt? What have you done to mange the pain? This information is incredibly helpful for doctor's visits.

## 4. Eating Out &/or Drinking Alcohol


Both of these things are fine *(actually quite nice!)* when done with proper moderation. Did you eat out today? Did you drink? Bonus fun: where/why/with whom?

## 3. Some Tangible, Measurable Part of Your Journey Between "Who I am Now" and "Who I Want to Be"


What gets measured gets managed. If you want to be thinner, track your calories. If you want to get stronger, track your workouts. If you want to get your degree, track how many hours you study. If you want to get more sales, track your calls. If you want to be more worldly, track your travels & new experiences.

## 2. Summarize Your Day

Put a nightly entry into a notebook or a calendar. Send yourself an email. Fill out a Google Forms web form. Make a Survey Monkey for yourself. Whatever. Just unload some thoughts about the day and what it was like.

## 1. Fitness Tests


At *least* annually. According to however you define "Fitness". See [my post on this topic](https://aarongilly.com/379)[^1].

# Motto: Original, Please

The first thing I'd like to talk about in today's column relates back to [Column #61 - Movie Mode](https://aarongilly.com/63). It concerns creative output and it occurred to me when I was driving down the road listening to Modest Mouse. Basically, I have been impressed with their music for the past couple of months now. It's creative. It's clever. It's catchy. Lately, I have been thinking to myself "why are these other people so creative and clever, and most of what I think or do kind of sucks?" Then I started thinking about Mike Birbiglia, a comedian I like. His jokes are clever and creative. Recently I watched a movie he made called "Sleepwalk with Me" - it's available on Netflix. Although I liked the movie, I have to say I was disappointed by it. It was basically just all of his previously existing standup jokes presented in movie format. 

Then it hit me. All at once.

All of this clever, creative geniusness that these people have made a living out of... they are old things they've made that they repeat over and over and over, day in and day out. They don't output new genuisness every time they think. They probably have had just as many bad ideas as I have; it's just that they have spent a lot more time presenting and marketing their good ones. And I'm too lazy for that. I don't like the idea of presenting the same thing over and over again to new audiences. I'd rather turn out mediocre bullcrap on a more frequent basis. Be original, please. Be Aaron Gillespie.

"Original, please" is an anagram of "Aaron Gillespie". This is something clever and creative that I figured out a long time ago. And here I am, re-hashing to a new audience - all in the name of irony.

Have you ever been driving down the road, thinking deeply about this or that, then suddenly realize "I have no idea how I got to this point. I have no recollection of the past 5 minutes of driving. How was I staying between the lanes? What happened?" During this period of complete and utter zoned-outedness, what part of your brain was in control of your life? Your unconscious? Your autopilot? This happens to me all the time. Not only when I'm driving, though; it happens all the time in every day situations. I am doing one thing rather absent-mindedly while my thoughts are over here or over there. One great example that comes to mind happens every time I try to read something long. At some point while I am reading along I suddenly realize that I have stopped comprehending what I was reading. I realize that I was just moving my eyes across the text with a pace that approximates my average reading speed. At some point in my reading, I entered the zone. I turned on autopilot. After I realized I was in the zone, I'm instantly back out of it. I have to re-assess and figure out what happened during the time I spent there. I think: "Where am I?" "How did I get here?" "Where is my mind?"

It's like the movie Memento (which is a fantastic movie, BTW). There are a few scenes in particular I'm thinking of. [This isn't the best one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgGf5X8-j1s), but the first 25 seconds are the best such scene that I can find. 

The last big thing I want to talk about is the phrase "I'm not racist, but...". I have heard this several times in my life. Usually, I hear it right after meeting someone for the first time. And, I hate to say this, but there is essentially no way you can start a sentence off with "I'm not racist, but..." and end it in such a way that I don't think "man, this guy's a racist." You can't say "I'm not a racist, but..." then say something racist. That's like saying "I'm not a murder, but I have killed people." It does not logically follow. If you have to start a sentence with "I'm not racist, but", you should just admit to yourself that you are a little bit racist.

I used the "jokes" label in this column. This is the joke. I thought of it yesterday. It's not great:
You know the old joke pick-up line "Hey girl, are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only ten I see!". I was thinking about applying that to a more average-looking girl - "Hey girl, are you from Sevennessee?"

I told you it wasn't great.

KU Men's basketball has lost 3 games in a row. The last time I can remember this being the case: Never. I've never been consciously aware of KU losing 3 games in a row. It's a bummer. We won 17 in a row against some very good teams. Then we lost 3 in a row against some very mediocre-to-bad teams. 

I was going to put a the picture I took for my passport as the picture for this column, but now I'm all weirded out by that idea for some reason. Instead, I'll put a couple sample pictures from my trip to Lawrence to see my friends:

When I try to hug my guy friends like this I usually get punched.
This was a precious "we're best friends" moment I happened to capture of my ex-residents.

Those posts are stabbingly sharp.
This is Ben and the fence that very well could have killed him.

# Top 5: Sports (to watch)
5. Pool - I don't consider it a sport. I also realize that NOBODY other than me actually watches it. I appreciate the game, though. So much that I've definitely watched many a tournament.
4. Football (college)
3. Football (professional)
2. Basketball (college)
1. Volleyball (women's)

A couple of completely unrelated topics for you today.

# Breakfast is Broken

![[452-1.png]]

Picking up on a topic I briefly covered in [Column #394](https://aarongilly.com/394/#breakfast) - breakfast is *broken*.

What breakfast has going for it:

- Breakfast foods are delicious
- Breakfast is nice to have as a social time

What breakfast *also* brings:

- Typical breakfast foods are not good for you
- Breakfast slows you down in the morning
- Breakfast necessitates another tooth brushing session, or else puts your oral health at risk
- Breakfast costs money and creates dishes
- Breakfast *might* be associated with other negative health outcomes - depending on how much you buy into the intermittent fasting literature

Have you ever tried skipping breakfast? If you found that painful, have you ever tried skipping breakfast *consistently* for a period of time? 

When I did, I stopped missing breakfast. 

I do still have it from time-to-time, but it’s something I’m phasing out of my life.

# How to Write a Bestselling Self-Help, Business, or Productivity Book

A sarcastic guide from a guy who has no experience.

![[452-2.png]]

## 1. Come up with a new term, or pick an obscure one

You want a term like

Stillness

Essentialist

Antifragility

Atomic

Grit

Outliers

Hyperfocus

Ultralearning

Effortless

..and so on.

## 2. Find ways to relate your term to universally good things

If you can rope in things like *gratitude*, and *habits*, and *focus*, and *health*, and *simplicity* in as well… you got a best-seller on your hands. See also: Mindfulness, Flow, Contentment, Zest, Resilience, Energy, Frugality…



🔥 Tip: Your term *really* means **all** those things!

## 3. Find some evocative stories of great success, claim the term was the key to that success

Google “world’s best ____”, or “hero saves the day”, or “overcomes adversity to…” and look around for some story of success. Look at the circumstances leading up to that success. Figure out how to interject your key word.



# Top 5: Best New Notes I’ve Written

Honestly my Notes are continuing to flourish. The Column is probably going to continue being slow-to-grow - and that’s okay.

# Motto: The next step. (watch yourselves, he's all deep and stuff)

I can now say something that I've been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading for the past four months and one week: 

I have work in the morning. 

After I write this column, my next order of business is sleep. 
My next order of business is an early morning workout. 
My next order of business is my first day of my first real job. 

I am on salary, so I guess I technically start making money in about a half hour as of the posting of this column. That's kind of cool. I'll make money while I sleep tonight. That's what I'm going to tell everyone when they ask what I do for a living. "Me? Oh, I'm salaried. I get paid to live." THEN I'll brag about my job.

Sounds like a good plan. No?

My nephew is cute. Videographic evidence:

(this video was lost to time)

I honestly should go to bed.

Here's the picture for this post:

I had the perfect sticker for the entrance to my bathroom.

Top 5: Upsides to Working
5. A more structured life
4. An excuse if I ever feel like getting out of something I didn't want to go to
3. The chance to be on the cutting edge of technology and work with something I'm quite passionate about
2. Money
1. I don't feel like a lazy worthless piece of garbage!

#  Motto: Don't be an Oxymoron 

The entire body of this update between this sentence and the picture to go out on will be a poem I wrote today.

> Yesterday I drove to the park. There I met a new old man and had this conversation. It started when I told him life seemed deathly hard - it's simply too difficult.  He said -  "You should think a little bigger. You aren't failing to succeed, you are working to success through failure. It's alright to be all wrong; because once your fails pass, you'll find what's left is what's right." What he was saying sounded awfully good.  "Let me tell you a true story - Originally, I just copied others. I had been a minority in a major way. Then I was stuck in the same quest to be different... and it was pretty ugly. My attempts were really fake. I felt like everyone hated me. I was even at odds with myself..." He paused to watch some kids play. He only stopped to continue.  "Now then, the past is a present. The new days, they're here. You're forgetting to remember the victories. You need to remember to forget your defeats. They are old news - stop going there. Consider yourself fortunately unfortunate. You've had to push yourself to pull through. Don't accept a decline in your life. Keep changing! You can't fill a tall glass in short order. With effort, things will come easier. Once you get afoot, you will get ahead. Your failures will increasingly decrease; and as things come to pass, you'll have found you never really lost." As he started to finish, I thought about us. We sat there together, alone with our conversation. I looked dumbly at the wise man.  What he said seemed quite possibly impossible.  I mean, he was nice; but I was certainly uncertain of what he meant.  I clearly misunderstood.  Good grief.

When it comes to poetry:

![](assets/90-1.jpg)

# Top 5: Things I could have written about instead of posting that poem
5. I updated my Life Tracker. I added a new feature and it only took about 20 minutes of coding. I'm doubly proud.
4. My workouts have been getting easier despite the fact I keep adding more weight. 
3. I think poetry has a bad rap. There's a stigma associated with someone who reads, writes, and/or enjoys poetry... and that's not cool. I appreciate good wordplay. 
2. I made a video just to make a video. It's funny-ish, but too low-brow for the Column's high standards.
1. I updated my second-a-day video. I have the timing worked out for the rest of the video, and it works perfectly. It took some doing and some creativity - but it's going to be worth it in a couple months when I'm done.

# PSAs
## A Good Computer
I recently got the new Mac Mini M4, base model. No upgrades. On Black Friday sale at Costco it was marked down from its MSRP of $599 to a very hard to pass up $499. I have used this new insanely small computer for a couple weeks now, the thing **rocks**. Used it for development work, pushing two 4k monitors at one point. I did some light video editing on it - including color corrections and effects - and it has yet to show any semblance of a hiccup. This coming year I will put it through its paces as I try to learn Fusion360 for CAD Modeling.

If you're nearing the market for a new computer, this looks to be a great choice. 
## A (Bad) Free Game
As of the posting of this column, you can [click this link to do my puzzle box for 2024](https://aaronspuzzles.com/BriefMystery) for free - **no box required**!

What you need:
- A computer (or tablet, *maybe*, but not your phone)
- Approximately 30 minutes, depending on how you do
- End of list

That's right! After multiple years of puzzle boxes that only ~12 groups got to play, this one is available with an **online only** option.
## (Good) Free Games
I've decided I don't play enough games in my life. I've solved that recently via a few avenues I'd like to make sure my reader knows about.

**[New York Times Games](https://apps.apple.com/app/id307569751)** app - gives you access to a bevy of free word-based games. Everyone was into the Wordle a few years back. They are still going with that, and several other similar-ish games. Great way to spend *some* (but not **all** of your time)

**Netflix games** - Did you know, if you have an active Netflix subscription you *also* have a subscription to a host of games on Apple's App Store? Sure some (most) of them don't interest me, but there are a few good & critically-adored games too. 
Examples: 
- [Kentucky Route Zero](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1608096851) (which I stopped playing due to time constraints)
- [Rise of the Golden Idol](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6618112283) (which I'm playing now)

**Amazon Prime games** - Did you know, if you have an active Amazon Prime subscription you *also* have a subscription to a host of games on the web? As I wrote about in [[453#Fallout|Column 453]], I played Fallout: New Vegas recently. What I didn't share there was that I played it *through my iPad browser* using a PlayStation Controller without signing up for anything or paying a $0 on top of my regular Prime Subscription. This was using a cloud gaming service Amazon runs called [Luna](https://luna.amazon.com/) that I hadn't known about. [You can click this and probably play Fallout for free within a minute](https://luna.amazon.com/game/fallout-new-vegas-ultimate-edition/B0CW16SB1M).
## A Good Application of AI
I came across a good application of ChatGPT recently. In creating the intro video to "Brief Mystery", I utilized Final Cut Pro on my aforementioned awesome computer. I have not worked with Final Cut before, so I didn't know how to do very basic things like color corrections, clip splitting, slip-editing, and changing the export settings. I Googled some stuff and found semi relevant forum posts, but wasn't satisfied. I turned next to ChatGPT and asked for help - holy crap it was like having someone sitting next to me who knew what I was trying to do and coached me through the button presses and keyboard shortcuts. It was ***awesome***.

# Motto: Better late than never!

I have sat down to write this column on no fewer than four occasions now. This is my fourth and final attempt to write something before I give up and throw my computer out a window. My first and third attempts were cut short by a BSoD (that’s Blue Screen of Death, for those of you who aren’t up on your nerd-cronyms). Luckily, blogger does SAVE automatically (thank you, Google); but, by the time I sat down to write again, what I had written the time before was no longer valid. Example: “I’m in Oklahoma” “Melissa is going to be leaving” “I’m in St. Louis”. All of those things are no longer true. My second attempt to write this entry was cut short by a complete and utter lack of focus.

I’m focused now. So I apologize to my many many avid fans that I didn’t update for so long. I had a very abnormal schedule for a while there. Things are back to normal now, though; and I have a lot to write about. No more will I have these super dooper long posts with super dooper long periods in between. It’s a win-win, somehow.

So, what’s new in my life? Here’s an outline that will answer just that:
My second week in Oklahoma City was not nearly as fun as my first one. The newness of the city wore off. I just wanted to go back to my own apartment each night. I took a cool picture, though.

Also, the best photosphere I've ever taken.

![](assets/57-1.jpg)

Photosphere next to the botanical gardens in OKC
                                 
Melissa left for Thailand. She’s there for half a year to finish up her studies and graduate with both her degrees from KU. She has wireless at her place. She has a new Nexus phone and tablet. She and I have been in consistent contact since she left.
We have done Google Hangouts. We have done Google Messenger. We have done Google Talk. In the big, long list of things that Google has done for me in my life, I am going to have to add “relationship sanity maintenance”.
There’s more about Melissa coming up.
Melissa and I had our official three-year anniversary. She was in Thailand, though. Celebrations were done remotely.
After the outline, I’ll talk some more about this.
I went to St. Louis for more work training. I saw the arch. Didn’t really do much more than that in the way of “touristy crap”, because I was only there for a day.
It’s worth mentioning the radio show “This American Life” right here. I listen to podcasts of the long history of that show during my long driving trips. In the past 3 weeks I’ve driven for probably 12 to 15 hours, at least; so I’ve gotten to hear a TON of shows. I’ll do a brief plug for it in a sub-bullet.
This American Life is a NPR show that takes a topic or a theme and gives a variety of different stories based around that theme. It covers anything and everything. It’s almost always entertaining and thought-provoking. It’s a much better time-passer than music when it comes to long car trips. I highly suggest it. If you have an hour of house chores or some other mindless task to do, you should listen to [this show about Testosterone](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone). NOTE: There are some adult themes in this, although nothing particularly vulgar... I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't watch an R-rated movie alone.
I rewrote my New Year’s resolutions and officially started them. See my first Top 5.
I gave my PlayStation 3 to my father for his retirement. Then he decided he wasn’t retiring just yet. What a jerk.
I got a new PlayStation 3. It’s smaller, lighter, and runs a tiny bit quieter. Doesn’t take up as much room on my desk and it came with 4 of the 7 games I want to play while Melissa is away in Thailand. For more on that, see my second Top 5.
I rearranged my place entirely. The 5 hour process all started when I went to put my new PlayStation in and thought “I am going to make these cables neater”. That lead to a complete room re-arrangement. That’s just how I work. Here’s after:

It seems like 50% of my photos are now panoramas or photospheres
The after. Basically just switched the placement of the desk and sofa and added the bookshelf.
I have spent the past three nights doing things with friends. Tomorrow looks to be similar.
Specifically: Watched the KU vs. KSU game (KU won). Went to a bar-trivia night for the first time (we got 3rd out of 9 teams). Went to a sneak preview for the movie “Side Effects”. Tomorrow I’m watching Zero Dark Thirty. All of these things are with different groups of friends. Actually, I’m basically every single one of my best friends (save one) in a single, four-day span. I now have reoccurring plans to see many of them on a weekly basis.

Anyway, that’s all of the cut-and-dry “this is what happened” events since my last update. Now onto what I’ve been thinking about, and what I want to actually write about.

Last night, Nick introduced me to a group of his friends. After my name, he added “he’s the guy who made the Jif Gif”. I saw a couple of their eyes light up and them say “THAT’S where I know you from!”. I essentially got recognized by the Jif Gif. That image has been seen over 1.3 million times now, BTW.

“This American Life” told me a story about a group of physicists adapting The Drake Equation to see how many possible girlfriends there was in their city. The Drake Equation is, in short, an equation to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. The Wikipedia article of the Drake Equation mentioned that the TV show The Big Bang Theory did a joke about this exact same thing. Makes me wonder if the writers listened to that episode of TAL.

Melissa and I have been dating 3 years. She is excellent and I can say with honesty that these have been the best three years of my life. While there are plenty of other reasons why that is, she is definitely a huge part of that. She is beautiful, kind, smart, and nerdy in just the right ways. She’s supportive of my endeavors, and tolerant of my quirks. The same could be said about her family, by the way. They have been great, and I actually plan to go see them while Melissa is gone. Anyway, Melissa is fantastic and I still can’t believe how lucky I am to have her. The past 3 years have been awesome, and I hope to be able to say the same thing again in another 3 years.

Cuticle nippers are a Godsend.

I just bought a new (“new” meaning “refurbished”) laptop. Hopefully this will solve the BSoD issues. I know I said before that I was going to build a computer… but I bought this laptop, which is a step up from my computer in every way, for less than $500, shipped. I’ll get it Monday.

My only New Year’s Resolution this year is to live a more structured life. This leads to many, smaller goals (this is detailed next, in the Top 5) which I have officially started. In addition to this, I am still doing my [Demetri List](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xSvVKsVS17I/UIQywCJcUfI/AAAAAAAAV30/Ym6SnoAKeUo/s640/List+2.0.png). I can already see a big spike productivity on the Demetri List. It’s going to be very interesting to see how increased structure in my life contributes to all of my daily goals. It’s like a self-psychological experiment, complete with data, the scientific method, and a great measurement tool all-in-one. Boom.

Sorry about this column. It wasn’t very “haha”-centric. Nor overly inspired. Enough.

# Top 5: New Year’s Resolution-Inspired Changes 
5. Sleep. Specifically, from 10:30 to 6 or from 11 to 6:30 during the weekdays. “Weekday” is Sunday evening through Friday evening. 
4. Workout. MWF – Heavy, compound lifts. TuTh – Cardio and stretching. 
3. Diet. Not the “lose weight” kind, just the “eat responsibly” kind. Smoothies after each workout, complete with random powdered supplements and fruit. At least 2 liters of water/day. Making myself breakfast, lunch, and dinner – and doing so with the intent to learn to make more, new, and different things and with my budget and health goals in mind. Having said that: 
2. Budgeting. I have been “budgeting” for a while now; but it was more of an after-the-fact type budget. It was more of an audit of my already-engrained spending habits. Now, I have set up actual budgeting goals that I go to the store with. Speaking of the store, I picked out a store and started a membership with them. All in the name of structure and cost-savings. My budget allows me to tunnel away a healthy chunk of my income, AND allows for me to do things like buy a computer. After taxes and shipping I went 78 cents over budget on that, by the way. 
1. I summarized all of my changes in four points. I guess I can use this one to say that the weekends are intentionally unstructured. Too much structure is just as bad as no structure at all (maybe).


# Top 5: Things I want to do now that Melissa is out of the country (and I can use time like a man without a girlfriend would)
5. I have a list of 7 single-player videogames I want to play through. Four of these games came with my new PlayStation. I’m currently playing through Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. It’s good so far.
4. Learn to code on Android. Code a program for sending encrypted messages. I like coding for codes. So much code.
3. Clean out and update all my digital repositories. I am already proud of how my digital architecture is laid out, but I have definitely let some clutter into the system. I have duplicate contacts. Contacts with old data. Old documents that no longer serve a purpose. An inconsistent video storage system. Programs I never use. With my upcoming computer, I’m going to fix all that. It will take time.
2. Really ramp up my time spent with friends and family.
1. Nerd out. Constantly.

TECH STUFF! 

# WWDC23

Even before I became an Apple user I thought their annual developer’s conference, “WWDC”, was an exciting time of year. Whatever Apple does moves the consumer electronics industry forward in a way that can't be said of Google, Samsung, or the litany of B-tier Android device manufacturers. Although the Android “fragmentation problem” has gotten better, there is no single day with a wider adoption of new features than when Apple rolls out the next version of iOS to their giant market share. 

These are the things I was excited about this year. A lot of them have to do with widgets, apparently. This year "WWDC" stands for "Widgety Widget Developer's Conference".

## iOS 17

### Better Widgets

Are more android-like. You can do things with a widget other than open the associated app. A no-brainer that should have been in the initial release.

### Standby

The next release of iOS comes a lot of niceties, but the one I'm most excited about is a feature they call “Standby”. 

![IMG_9161.jpeg](assets/437-1.jpg)

When your phone is charging and turned sideways it will enter into a sort of smart-display-like mode. Using large fonts and showing you Siri results, widgets, and all sorts of stuff. I could easily imagine using this in conjuction with a HomePod (or really any speaker) to effectively replace a Google Home or Amazon Alexa setup. Your phone (or iPad) could become the screen for your smart speaker. Google is already moving this direction with their latest Pixel Tablet. 

This also allows for your charging phone to show context-senstive **widgets**.

### App Updates

The keyboard is apparently going to get markedly better, learn how I write, and not make me fix every ducking bad autocorrect.

Apple’s “Notes” app will allow linking directly to a note, which enables linking *between* notes. This isn't enough to put it over the line for me as a serious contender for me to replace Notion with, but this does open it up to becoming a more capable companion. 

### Siri

No longer “Hey Siri” - you have the option of making it just “Siri”. I'm a Siri apologist, and very keen on this feature. 

### Journal

A mindfulness-based journaling app, built into the phone and tied into the already stellar “Health” app. This app plus the APIs could be interesting for me in a future project. 

## iPadOS

### Better Lock Screen

The iPad Lock Screen will now also be getting customization and **widgets**. Good stuff. 

### Better Widgets

Same as on iOS, widgets are now interactive. Arguably even more important on the iPad. 

### App Updates

Basically all the same stuff as in the iPhone version up there applies. Most importantly, the iPad is getting the Health app, so you can interact with those data on a bigger screen.

## WatchOS 10

The whole OS is getting overhauled. There will be much more focus put on **widgets**, and less on apps on your wrist. All the apps are getting an overhaul, too.

## MacOS Sonoma

For the first time ever, MacOS updates meant something to me! On the desktop. Included here mostly for thematic consistency. I guess that's it.

## Vision Pro

The thing everyone is talking about from WWDC is the Vision Pro. It is Apple’s way more capable, way more expensive competitor to Facebook’s “Quest 2” virtual reality headset. It is aiming to be a **very different** kind of product. The Quest 2 is a video game console that sometimes tries to be more. The Vision Pro is aiming to be more like your computer and phone wrapped into one, that sometimes tries to be a video game console.

The Vision Pro is a *vision* of the future… but it's not there yet. For those of you who read this but don't follow tech news (HI MOM), this is Vision Pro:

![not good](assets/437-2.gif)

I want the capability to throw up a big virtual screen wherever I am, floating midair. I want to be able to augment the real world with an overlay of helpful or entertaining content. But I absolutely do not want my view of the world to be passed through a screen showing me what a camera sees in front of me. 

I will ditch my phone as soon as augmented reality WITHOUT ACTUALLY robbing me of seeing the world. I don't want a camera and a screen showing me pass thru. I want something more akin to Google Glass, but with a full pair of glasses. I recognize that this will prevent full “virtual reality” without the ability to block out ambient light, but that's a small price to pay for living your life without your eyes actually *seeing* your life.

That's some Black Mirror[^1] stuff.



# Top 5: Lessons Learned Through Pain



## 5. Respect Potential Energy in All its Forms

Precariously hanging tree limbs. Rubber exercise bands. Barbells and dumbbells that are in use. I respect all these things thanks to a run-in I had with a slingshot that I stretched beyond is failure point when I was a kid. 



## 4. Beware Carrying Things that Block Your Vision

Who hasn't carried something that obscured their vision then tripped over something or stepped on something? I can't recall the exact incident that stuck with me, but I'm ALWAYS aware of whether or not I can see the ground I'm walking on.



## 3. Don't Sprint Under Low Overhangs

Good advice generally. If you're 6’9” it's GREAT advice.



## 2. Wear Appropriate Footwear

I once forgot my basketball shoes, but decided to play anyway in my chucks. I will save the gory details, but what followed was several weeks of horribleness.



## 1. Don't Push Too Hard

This lesson you have to relearn a few times as you age. As a kid I could basically go forever. Somewhere in my 20’s I had my first instance of injury from pushing too hard weightlifting. I learned and relearned in the weight room what the “right” level of struggle was. Recently I crossed that stress and strain threshold wielding a shovel and a 5 gallon bucket. A month later I'm still dealing with fallout.

Motto: You Can Survive _Anything_ for Just 10 Seconds!

  
Melissa and I went on our first real bike ride yesterday. We went on a 2.92 mile jaunt around our neighborhood, with one stop at Chipotle. It was my first "bike ride" in years. It was really fun! Hopefully we've got plenty more good days for these left before it gets too crazy hot.  
  
I've had two vehicles for some time now. MK1 has had a full-fledged trunk monkey for a while now. As of Monday I can say that MK2 is getting there (also thanks to Tony from Christmas time).  
  
Here's what they look like...  
  
### MK1 trunk monkey:

I finished my first Udacity course, "Intro to HTML/CSS". It was a good time, actually. I utilized that knowledge to thin out some of the redundant styling tags on these posts. As a result, this page loaded infinitesimally faster than it would have otherwise (you're welcome). I'm moving on to a class about GitHub, which I think makes me officially "a coding person".   
  
Speaking of nerdy things - Dominion: Adventures is out. I'm waiting on my pre-ordered copy to arrive at the local game store.   
  
And while I'm at it I'll just say that my excitement and anticipation is mounting to unbelievable levels for Age of Ultron (in 9 days). Add that to the fact that Melissa and I are planning to take a small vacation shortly thereafter to celebrate our 1-year and I might just pass out.  
  
There's a ton of anticipation (and potential stress) around what you get your S.O. on your first marriage anniversary. People say it sets the bar for all subsequent years. If you read <the Wikipedia article about it>, it looks like I should be getting Melissa a clock that's simultaneously made out of paper and Mother of Pearl, painted with Carnations. I was thinking about skipping ahead 9 years and getting her something made of Aluminium.  
  
Google just announced their wireless service "Project Fi". Check out the Top 5 for my initial reactions.  
  
One other thing worth mentioning - today is April 22nd, 2015\. The first day on record in my Life Tracker is April 22nd, 2013\. I've officially been doing this for 2 years. (note: I've only successfully managed to record 77 of the possible 104 weeks during that time span, giving me a grade "C").

  
Top 5: **Initial Reactions to Google's Wireless Service**  
5\. Only available to people using the Nexus 6 phone... that's limiting your audience to a fraction of a percent of the country. This may be a smart move for "testing the waters", but it's an instant turn-off.  
4\. Being able to take and make calls from your home WiFi and then walk out into the real world without having to end the call is going to be awesome. As is the notion of using your tablet or laptop as a full-fledged phone. The seamless ubiquity of connection looks promising.  
3\. You are credited for any data you don't use each month, and the cost for going over your data allotment is the same $10/GB that you'd be paying anyways... so why have tiers at all? What's the point? If you use 4GB, you're paying $40 regardless of what tier you're on. Why complicate things?  
2\. I wonder what influence this will have on the future direction of Android and other Google products? Will I begin to suffer a lack of functionality in Android because I'm not on Fi?  
1\. $10 per GB + a flat $20 monthly charge for all non-data related activity just does not begin to move the needle for anyone using >3GB/mo, price-wise. 10GB for 2 phones is $130 through AT&T, $130 through Verizon, and now $140 through Google. I don't think this is the disruption Google was looking for.

# What is "Healthy"?

I've [already written](https://aarongilly.com/340) about the unsatisfying definition you'll find if you look up ("healthy")[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/healthy]... so I'm not going to belabor the point or repeat myself here. Suffice to say there isn't one specific universal definition. I wanted to write mine down. See the **Top 5**.

I wanted to write briefly about my new *(attempt at implementing an old)* plan: to utilize a set of common tests to measure my general physical fitness over time. The previous instance of this idea provided a more robust, granular picture of fitness... but, [as a person who feels okay saying he's more than an amateur self-tracker](https://aarongilly.com/377), I've learned the necessary ROI to continue tracking whatever interests me. My original "fitness benchmark" required at *least* a week's worth of intense workouts to measure. The new one takes one workout, and *also* works as a pretty decent workout in and of itself. This minor rejigger makes the juice worth the squeeze. A related, second change was pre-planning the cadence upon which I'd take the tests (going so far as to schedule them in my calendar). 

# Tests in the Failed First Attempt

![[379-2.png]]

I don't know what I was supposed to do for "yoga". That sort of lack of specificity is typical of a poorly thought out premise. Truthfully, looking at this table again, I think it may be worth keeping around, but not as a "fill out an entire line THIS WEEK". More like a supplemental "fill in a relevant datum as needed" to the Life Tracker.

# The New Hotness

As pictured in the header of this post - here's the what and why of the *new* fitness benchmark test. Get ready for me to use the term "proxy metric" a lot, because it makes me feel smart. I'm going to link to Wikipedia here, so don't think I'm taking myself too seriously. I stole most of these ideas from other organizations who've thought a lot more about this stuff than I have. Borrowing ideas is a great strategy for stuff like this. Also I tried to minimize the dependency on equipment as much as possible.

![[379-1.png]]

## Morning Of

The test begins before even getting out of bed in the morning. Three of these four tests are taken from the list of vital signs they take when you go in for a standard "wellness visit" to your doctor. I utilized their expert judgment over my own.

### Resting Heart Rate
*Metric: Heart Rate in Beats per Minute.*  
Taken in the morning, before getting out of bed. [Resting heart rate](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/heart-rate/faq-20057979) is a proxy measure of overall fitness.

### Blood Pressure
*Metric: Averages from three measures throughout the morning (standard measures - systolic/diastolic in mmHg)*  
This requires proper equipment, which is cheaper than you'd expect. Got a spare $25? You can buy an automated blood pressure monitor. High blood pressure is associated with heart attacks and strokes and other bad stuff. I'm not a doctor.

### Body Weight
*Metric: Weight in lbs, or kg, or stone if you're from wherever that unit of measure is used*  
Not much to say. Weight has inextricably links to many health outcomes. Managing weight has got to be one of the Top 10 areas of focus most commonly shared by Americans.

### Rolling Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
*Metric: Average HRV (in milliseconds) from the previous 5 nights*  
This one is *not* taken by the nurse before you talk with your Primary Care Physician. HRV is another indicator of health, in this case, heightened stress levels tend to lower HRV, among other correlations. [Read more about it here if you like](http://www.markwk.com/hrv-for-beginners.html). Then read the rest of his stuff.  
HRV requires an Oura Ring or something similarly capable of measuring HRV. The Apple Watch can do it to some extent if you download the right app.

## Pre-tests

The goal of these tests is to get a feel for your agility, balance, and explosiveness - without wearing you out.

### Pinned Leg Balance
*Metric: Time Stood*  
Stand on one foot. Place your other foot against the side of your standing leg, about halfway between the knee and the foot. Close your eyes. Time how long you can stay in this position without toppling.

### Pistol Squat
*Metric: Ability to complete at least one pistol squat (both sides)*  
A pistol squat is a one-legged bodyweight squat in which you go *all the way down* until you're nearly sitting on the ground before standing back up. Pistol squats require strength, balance, coordination, and good range of motion. Also, the are conveniently just barely within my physical capacity to do most of the time. Good test candidates.

### Broad Jump
*Metric: Distances jumped, in your preferred unit of measure for distance*  
Broad jump is just a standing long jump. Put your toes on a line. Jump off both feet as far forward as you can. Measure the distance between the line and where your heels land. It tests your ability to generate power. It's one of the tests used in the NFL combine. Turns out I'm good at these so I'm going to keep doing them and making myself feel good.

## The Workout

This is the part that's supposed to be hard. It's mostly adapted from the standard combat fitness trials employed by our armed services.

### 1.5 Mile Run
*Metric: Time to Complete*  
Just run, for an extended period of time. Walk if you have to. Stop entirely if you have to. Stop the timer when you finish your run.  
I knew I was going to have a "the run" portion of this test. I debated myself literally for a couple of hours trying to pick a distance. The Army uses 2 miles. The Navy uses 3 miles. Ultimately, I went with 1.5 miles (which is used in the police fitness test) because I can generally run one mile no matter how bad of shape I'm in (at this point in my life, anyway), but if I ran a full 2 miles I wouldn't probably have the necessary energy to finish the remaining tests. I have given up on the pipe dream of being a guy who can move a ton of weight and run marathons and all this and that. There's a diminishing return on investment with everything. Right now I'm thinking the maximum I'd ever really want to be capable of running consistently is about 5k... and if I can run 1.5 miles without too much trouble I think that I'd be solid for a only-minimally-rough 5k.

### Pull ups
*Metric: Number of chin-to-bar touches in 2 minutes*  
Set a timer for 2 minutes. Do as many pull ups as you can. Don't "kip". Keep them clean.

### Push ups
*Metric: Number of full push ups done in 2 minutes*  
Set a timer for 2 minutes. Do as many push ups as you can. Hands under the shoulders. Touch the chest at the bottom. Maybe pick up the hands at the bottom to force yourself to keep them clean.

### Sumo Deadlift - 275 lbs
*Metric: max reps in one set at 275*  
If you're not me, this should probably read "Deadlift - whatever weight". I do Sumo Deadlifts over deadlifts because they are easier for tall people. 275 lbs has become my standard "heavy but doable" weight. Aim for something you'd like to be able to do in the neighborhood of 3 to 8 times.

### Plank
*Metric: Time held in seconds*  
Hold a plank for as long as possible. Elbows and toes on the ground. Stiff, straight body.

## The Cooldown

This part of the test is about flexibility, range of motion, and pure unadulterated vanity.

### Forward fold
*Metric: how difficult is it to touch the floor*  
Stand straight-legged. Lean forward and touch the ground. How difficult was that? That's the test. Alternatively you can sit and lean forward. This lets you measure how far past your feet you can reach, but I find capturing that information difficult... so I use the "how much of my hand can I touch the floor with" method.

### Pinned Leg Squat
*Metric: Pass or fail*  
Stand with feet and knees together. Perform a full squat. You should be able to do this if you've got full range of motion. Now that I"m looking at things this may be redundant given the Pistol Squat test. But hey, that means it's easy.

### Overhead Wall Squat
*Metric: Pass or fail*  
Stand with your toes 2-4 inches from a wall. Put your hands over your head. Squat down, keeping your arms up. The goal here is to do a squat without touching the wall. If you can't do it, that means you're leaning too far forward with your squats. I'm not a PT. I Googled range-of-motion tests that could be done at home and this came up as an option.

### Pictures
*Metric: How many likes your fitness Instagram gets*  
Pictures are motivating. Also juxtaposition of pictures of roughly the same pose in roughly the same environment can really bring to light the aggregate effects of slow changes made over time. I don't have a fitness Instagram, by the way.

That's that. Hopefully someone else will have this idea, find this page via Googling whatever and steal some of my ideas for their own use. I always encourage that. In fact, [here's a copy of the Google Spreadsheet template I made for it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qGPCBW3gkAhG-EBtMYYoKXv-UFdBiZLV3GaBszXwGwA/edit?usp=sharing).

# Top 5: My Personal Health Goals

0. To maintain capacity to play sports at a decently competitive level for the foreseeable future
0. To maintain capacity to perform moderately difficult physical tasks 
0. To look like a person who can do both of the above
0. To avoid unnecessary pain
0. To maintain capacity to play with my kids and enjoy life as long as humanly possible

Motto: IT MIGHT SEEM CRAZY, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY...

  
I'm about to write something I promised myself I wouldn't ever write:  
  
"It's been so long since I wrote, I should write in my Blog more!"  
  
Now, it _has_ been a while... for good reason. I've been doing a lot of stuff... Namely:  
  
* Udacity classwork - the largest chunk of what I've been doing
* Battlefield 4 - a larger chunk than I'd like to admit
* Exercising - basketball 2-3 times a week, gym 1-2 times; am taking this 30 Day Challenge a bit more seriously
* Seeing friends - more than before
* Feature writing - I've written a bit on the Features that will eventually get updated (Tech Factionism, Marvel stuff, Life Tracker stuff)
* MCU rewatch - related to the feature writing
* Life Tracker fixes - my weather API provider decided to start flaking out, so I had to find a new one
  
I'm making an active effort towards "hobby diversification". I'm not saying I'm about to radically change the paradigm of my interests; but instead I am saying that I want to expand my scope of focus within the realms in which I was already interested. More on this at some later date (I won't continue that paragraph later, you'll just see the results of it).  
  
My Nexus 5 got the Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" update. I was excited. After the update I realized that there was essentially nothing new about the OS aside from a few UI tweaks. Google's "Now on Tap" feature hasn't been useful yet. The permissions model isn't "useful" on a day-by-day basis. Neither is the app-backup system.

Motto: What a Marvelous Continuation

#### **Preface:**

Nearly 4 years ago, I wrote [this long post about the Marvel Cinematic Universe](http://www.aarongilly.com/130) (as it existed then). In that post, I made several predictions, which may or may not have come true, and several statements, which now I may or may not disagree with. Since then, a lot has happened. The MCU has expanded. Another guy named Aaron and I made a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xfe--9Wshbb3ru0JplA2PnEwN7mVawazKmhWJjr%5FwKs). I made a video you'll see later. Everyone has become familiar with the shared-universe concept.

  
Thor: Ragnarok just came out. Last time I wrote this it was after the release of the previous Thor movie. It seems like a good time to go back to the well. This is my update to that post.

### A Brief History of the Marvel Cinematic Universe:

The MCU is a series of movies, shows, web series, and comic books produced by Marvel Studios that exist in the same shared universe, each telling their own story while contributing to a greater, overarching narrative. Specifically, this:

  
[![](assets/328-1.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3maeW8UOGj4/Wf4EvET9SNI/AAAAAAACzsE/Ysu5UMDi504Wn2xbIyfjXNkZyipv1Q11wCLcBGAs/s1600/All%2BMovies.PNG)

  
...and this...  
  
  
[![](assets/328-2.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QA9aNT2TL5s/Wf4LtB6By-I/AAAAAAACzt0/PDcDIW74TqQ3wNDt1BzkAfVxu5twgQaOACLcBGAs/s1600/All%2BShows.PNG)

  
Those are all the current and (and some of the future) canonical MCU movies & shows. I didn't include the tie-in comic books, web mini-series, Marvel One-Shots, or the upcoming TV shows on other networks in that graphic because they'd double its current size.   

  
**A quick word of warning:** my writing will assume you've already seen everything to date and will include spoilers for those who haven't.  

### Why is This such a Big Deal?

Comic books have a long history of using a shared universe, a continual continuity. The people, locations, and plotlines from one story connect to the other stories... Each entry into the universe tells its own story, but also serves to further the overarching narrative, affecting all subsequent stories. This concept is obvious, but for some reason nobody had successfully done that on-screen until Marvel starting in 2008 The MCU is the brainchild of Kevin Feige, a dude whose hand I'd love to shake one day.

Four years ago, I listened to [Kevin Fiege on the Nerdist Podcast](http://www.nerdist.com/2013/11/nerdist-podcast-kevin-feige/). I was nervous going into it. Nervous that he'd be weird, or antisocial, or otherwise unlikable. I was pleasantly surprised! He was as entertaining as he was knowledgeable. It's worth a listen still if you're interested to hear how the MCU came about & hear a weird snapshot in time where where they had _JUST_ announced that Avengers 2 would be _Avengers: Age of Ultron_.  

### Predictions (Past & Present)

In my previous post I made some bold predictions about the future of the MCU. That future has become the past, and my predictions have, on the whole, not at all come true. Good job me! This is an update to the predictions I made on November 25th, 2013:  
  
[![](assets/328-4.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GHYH%5Fzdm3OI/Wf4p5Pd7afI/AAAAAAACzvs/nMlJOQ1-gVk7g34E5%5FuSPeUeVN52NF6sACLcBGAs/s1600/Bad%2BPredictions.jpg)

  
I now present my _new_ predictions - in handwritten, vertical format for stylistic symmetry:

There's so much now, that's kind of tough to read. Basically - I'm guessing Ant-Man 3 will happen, as will Doctor Strange 2, Adam Warlock & Namor will get a movie, Black Widow will lead an all-female Avengers movie, and we'll have an Avengers 5 dealing with the Skrulls. If I get _two_ of those guesses correct, I'll be happy.  

### Critical Reception & My Opinions

#### **[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel%5Fcinematic%5Funiverse):**

94% - Iron Man

93% - Thor: Ragnarok

92% - Spider-Man: Homecoming

92% - Marvel's The Avengers

91% - Guardians of the Galaxy

90% - Captain America: Civil War

89% - Doctor Strange

89% - Captain America: The Winter Soldier

82% - Ant-Man

82% - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

80% - Captain America: The First Avenger

79% - Iron Man 3

77% - Thor

75% - Avengers: Age of Ultron

73% - Iron Man 2

67% - The Incredible Hulk

66% - Thor: The Dark World

  
I think Thor: Ragnarok will come down a few percent over time. It's still opening weekend right now.  
  
I have ranked & re-ranked things over and over. Most recently about 2 months ago. Doing this is like making Sophie's choice. Every time I do it, I think "ah! NO! I can't have \_\_\_\_\_ movie be the 7th highest! I LOVE that movie!". Then I shift them around and the movie I replace it with gives me the same problem. I try to get around that by assigning a "tier" system.  

#### Aaron:

Elite - Captain America: Civil War  
Elite - The Avengers  
Elite - Captain America: The Winter Soldier  
Elite - Spider-Man: Homecoming  
Elite - Guardians of the Galaxy  
Upper - Iron Man  
Upper - Thor: Ragnarok  
Upper - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

Upper-mid - Ant-Man  
Upper-mid - Captain America: The First Avenger  
Upper-mid - Thor  
Mid - Doctor Strange  
Mid - Iron Man 3  
Mid - Iron Man 2  
Mid - The Incredible Hulk  
Lower-mid - Thor: The Dark World  
  
Fun fact: in my previous MCU post I ranked Thor: The Dark World as the 3rd best of the 8 movies that were out at the time.  
  
Last time I wrote, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the only TV show airing. Now, that's _definitely_ not the case. Enough seasons of TV have aired in the past 4 years to make a TV-specific ranking!  

#### Rotten Tomatoes:

100% - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3  
98% - Daredevil Season 1  
96% - Luke Cage  
95% - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2  
95% - Agent Carter Season 1  
95% - Daredevil Season 2  
93% - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 4  
92% - Jessica Jones  
85% - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 1  
81% - Agent Carter Season 2  
74% - The Defenders  
17% - Iron Fist  
8% - Inhumans (it deserves this score)  

#### Aaron:

Elite - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 4  
Elite - Jessica Jones  
Elite - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3  
Elite - Daredevil Season 1  
Upper - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2  
Upper - Agent Carter Season 1  
Upper - Luke Cage  
Upper - Daredevil Season 2  
Upper-mid - Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D Season 1  
Mid - The Defenders  
Lower-mid - Agent Carter Season 2  
Lower - Iron Fist  
Garbage - Inhumans  

### Appreciation

### 

Consistency. Marvel has put out 17 movies. Every single movie has debuted #1 at the Box Office in its opening weekend. Every single movie has been a financial success. Every single movie has had more positive reviews than negative ones. The _worst_ of the 17 is still very entertaining. I'd be game to watch it right now. I'm actually going to put it on as I write more.

  
[![](assets/328-6.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VodN4Xx%5F4fY/WgicSAkBUwI/AAAAAAACz6g/c20LwqKL83ITPjmqvjYO-Xmq7DAAqGg9QCLcBGAs/s1600/Me%2BRight%2BNow.png)

  
It's all connected! It's awesome to me how every single story can be written in a way that fits into this broader universe. It's incredible to think that Rocket Raccoon and Jessica Jones could do a double-jumping high-five with Ghost Rider. I like how the implications or fallout from a movie informs subsequent movies & shows. SHIELD fell in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and that inspired a season-long storyline in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show.

  
Honestly, there's too much for me to write to try to cover everything I appreciate about this stuff. Here's some _smaller_ things I really like about consistencies:

  
There have been several instances of mind control int he MCU. Each time someone is being fully controlled, we are cued in by the same visual effect:

Now - there's another instance of mind-alteration eyeball cues... In The Avengers: Age of Ultron we see the influence of Scarlet Witch's hexes in the eyes of all of the Avengers. Since she doesn't really _control_ their mind, it's a different effect:  

| [![](assets/328-10.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TmZFwmJ7jSk/WgigPJKaLVI/AAAAAAACz7E/85x9z9xvXjMF-23j2Ij0WrY1MXRIZq-NACLcBGAs/s1600/Eyes4.jpg) |

Another consistency that I like is the sound effects across the universe. I put together this little video to show you what I mean:  
  
  
As I'm about to transition from good stuff to bad stuff - here's my awesome segue. I really love the original Guardians of the Galaxy trailer:
  
  
...but I HATE how many other trailers have come out since then that have utilized the "take an old song and modify it for use in this trailer to make you think if you like the song you'll probably like the movie" thing.

  
That said, the soundtrack (note: not the _score_ \- we'll get to that later) of the MCU is fantastic.  
  
[Evidence 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHkbhQC1hDc).  
[Evidence 2](https://youtu.be/v7MGUNV8MxU?t=15).  
[Evidence 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYlB38asDY).  
  
### Criticisms

As fantastic as the Marvel movies & shows are - like anything, you can find some things that could be better.  
  
First and foremost - Marvel is known for their heroes, **not their villains**. You could argue they are a bit hamstrung due to the fact the rights to their _best_ villains belong to Fox & Sony. The net result is the majority of movies thus far have had underdeveloped villains whose motivations were not set up, whose names weren't important enough to remember, and who were killed off after one movie. In most movies, the villain is just "a guy who does the same thing as the hero, but uses it for evil." Here's a helpful graphic:  

[![](assets/328-11.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LGANT0Yt0wE/Wgj3fq%5FcxtI/AAAAAAACz88/ihWGYXjgYGAAq%5FRxzxciYAFrXUsjcSxOACLcBGAs/s1600/Villains%2BAnalysis.png)

  
In addition to history of middle-of-the-road-at-best villains, the Marvel movies largely have a similar-ish feel. They balance action scenes with jokey moments. They have characters make quips in otherwise serious situations. Ultron should have been a downright terrifying villain, but he turned into Tony Stark. Both Guardians of the Galaxy movies have a joke moment seconds before the main villain is defeated. There are exceptions to this rule - notably the Captain America movies tend to be more somber. I don't really get bothered by this, because it makes for a great movie-going experience.  
  
This next bit probably doesn't bother the average person, but it does bother me.  
  
**It's all _(not)_ connected.**  
  
The **movies** **acknowledge** only the events of the **movies**.  
The **shows on ABC acknowledge** only the events of a couple **key movies** early on and other **shows on ABC** (and God I hope they ignore the Inhumans show).  
The **Netflix** stuff **acknowledges** only the events of **The Avengers** & other **Netflix** series.  
I'm going to guess that, as additional silos pop up (when Hulu gets their show, and Disney's streaming service gets its own show, etc) they will continue to ignore the other silos. The only thing everyone in the MCU can seem to agree on is that Tony Stark, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America fought aliens in New York at some point.  
  
Another big criticism - the elephant in the room that everyone should just forget about:  

[![](assets/328-12.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CkHVSoIwvt8/WgjIv0Ytc%5FI/AAAAAAACz8c/CVLANZOedgEux1HBv9AaTiZR%5FxwTKv2UACLcBGAs/s1600/Inhumans%2BPoop.jpg)

This show is technically canon to the MCU now. It's garbage. The writing. The directing. The acting isn't great, but they weren't given anything to work with, so it's hard to blame them. Just the writing. It's so terrible. I don't want to get into it here, maybe I'll write an entire post about how bad this is [a la Flightplan](http://www.aarongilly.com/249). Suffice it to say: Inhumans was awful. I legitimately think an average freshman in film school would have done a better job given the same resources.  
  
My last criticism - the score. This video does a better job of explaining the criticism than I ever could:  
  
Note - Melissa complained about this same thing all the way back in days of the original "Thor", which she saw with her class studying film music.  

### Thanos

Ever since the post credits sequence in The Avengers, the game has been on.

  
Who's Thanos? What's his deal?  
  
When I originally wrote this, I think those questions were a little less obvious. Now I'd be willing to guess most people reading this already know. Nevertheless... LET'S GET INTO IT!  
  
Thanos is **the** big bad.  
He's the villain above and beyond all villains.  
He's "the most powerful being in the universe" according to one source in canon.  
In the movies, we were technically introduced to him in the _(the best of all time)_ post-credits scene from "Marvel's The Avengers". We were _further_ introduced to him in "Guardians of the Galaxy" where Korath says that "most powerful" line from before, and [Thanos tells Ronan The Accuser that he's insignificant and boring](https://youtu.be/l8P3X6Esbbc?t=57).  
  
Thanos is the center of the comic book storyline "The Infinity Gauntlet", which I have not read... but I _have_ read the [Wikipedia Plot Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FInfinity%5FGauntlet), which is about as close to reading comics as I routinely get... because I don't expect most people to even give that a go - allow me to summarize that summary:  
  
The inciting incident of that storyline is that Thanos develops himself a crush... on Marvel's character "[Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%5F%28Marvel%5FComics%29)", who is sometimes just the Grim Reaper, sometimes a pretty lady.  
  
[![](assets/328-13.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DM1laT9gueQ/Wg0R9-%5F7acI/AAAAAAAC0AM/HZsN%5FY5Rm%5Fohsq%5FzABKbVtD2omXyT8NHwCLcBGAs/s1600/Thanos%2Band%2BDeath.jpg)

  
He likes her. He wants to get her a present. So he gathers the Infinity Gems. Puts them in a he kills half of the living beings in the universe, with a literal snap of the fingers. This is a nice present, but understandably makes the _other_ half of the universe fairly bothered. So they fight him. Thanos says "psh, you guys will have to roll a 21 to beat me" and they roll at 21\. That's not the real ending, but it makes about as much sense.  

#### How will this get translated to "Avengers: Infinity War"? 

Who knows.  
  
Thus far, we don't really know much about MCU Thanos. We don't have much information other than what I said up there, and POSSIBLY that he's in love with Death. [At the end of Marvel's The Avengers the Other One tell Thanos that fighting humans is "to court Death"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwiB%5F0eN%5FSE). His response is this:  
  
[![](assets/328-14.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4z3K55PT1u0/WgkD3TXRKBI/AAAAAAACz9o/RSyuqolI3Eku3mVHwjI%5FohGbJeHWatYUACLcBGAs/s1600/Thanos.jpg)

  
To me, that smile says "oh, dude, I'm _totally_ down to court Death with a capital D". That is pretty key to his character in the comics and I hope it gets translated to the MCU. 

  
There is a chance we may have already met "Death with a capital D".

  
[![](assets/328-15.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qMvPJaii6g/WgkGaWvGsBI/AAAAAAACz90/RclRazLOg9wIuTpj%5FGej1nUkAhgMtRi8gCLcBGAs/s1600/Death%2Bquestion%2Bmark.PNG)

  
Hela from "Thor: Ragnarok" is the _Goddess of_ Death. That could be the direction they are setting up. It would be easy to revive Cate Blanchett's character. I mean she's the Goddess of Death - how can she die? Who's going to take her away to the afterlife?  
  
Quick aside - Thor: Ragnarok was spectacular. Probably some of the best visuals in ALL of the MCU. Plus it was funny. Plus the action.

  
There's another question - how many of Thanos' insane list of powers & abilities are going to make it to his big screen version? In the comics Thanos is literally given all the powers of God once he's got the glove... but I don't imagine they'll do that. They really toned down Ultron - who isn't all that far off from being unstoppable in the comics. In "Avengers: Age of Ultron" he quickly lost his "I'm invincible thanks to the internet" power. I think they'll likely do the same for Thanos... or maybe _not._ They showed an advanced screening of the "Avengers: Infinity War" trailer at San Diego Comic Con and apparently he literally pulls pieces of the moon from the sky and throws them at the Avengers. He's still using a glove, after all:
  
  
...and the movies have been very clear that he's been trying to gather all six Infinity Stones. Which brings me to my next, and final point.  

### The Infinity Stones

Here's what's been said of the Infinity Stones thus far:  
  
"Before creation itself, there were 6 singularities. Then the universe exploded into existence and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots, the Infinity Stones."  
_\- The Collector, "Guardians of the Galaxy" -_  
  
"There are relics that predate the universe itself ... an ancient force of infinite destruction."  
_\- Odin, "Thor: The Dark World" -_   
  
"The Mind Stone is the 4th of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. It's not a coincidence. Someone is playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us."  
_\- Thor, "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" -_   
  
**The Space Stone:**  

[![](assets/328-16.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dS6dju44bwU/Wg5aY88V%5F8I/AAAAAAAC0CM/Hbtc5hahs24Dc-vHocm-dlg0UYDJrgNxQCLcBGAs/s1600/MCU%2BStones%2BSpace.PNG)

In the comics, the Space Gem allows its user to warp space, teleport themselves or any object to wherever, change distances, and basically grants Omnipresence.  
  
In the movies, the Space Stone (a.k.a. the "Tesseract") was technically introduced in "Captain America: The First Avenger", although it was not identified as an Infinity Stone until "Marvel's The Avengers". From what we've seen the Space Stone allows its user to open up portals in space. Also, either little pieces of it or technology inspired by it powers the Hydra weapons in the first Captain America movie.  
  
Right now in MCU canon the Space Stone is most likely in possession of Loki, following the events of "Thor: Ragnarok".  
  
**The Mind Stone:**  

[![](assets/328-17.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XQUSS3k3brs/Wg5c7LhkY0I/AAAAAAAC0Cg/Yrw67o2-KuYosS62DqZfIyr0yddmbuKzACLcBGAs/s1600/MCU%2BStones%2BMind.PNG)

In the comics, the Mind Gem allows its user to read peoples thoughts and control them.  
  
In the movies, the Mind Stone was technically introduced in "Marvel's The Avengers", although it was not identified as an Infinity Stone until "The Avengers: Age of Ultron". From what we've seen the Mind Stone allows its user complete mind control over an untold number of other individuals (although its affects can apparently be undone by a good smack to the head). It also is The Vision, to some extent, and can shoot some form of energy beam from his head capable of melting Vibranium & really ruining War Machine's day.  
  
Right now in MCU canon the Mind Stone is in the Vision's forehead.  
  
**The Reality Stone:**  

[![](assets/328-18.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ruYl3aodoQw/Wg5esfEDslI/AAAAAAAC0C4/2vSQlekEE4I7SCvffC%5Ft7TRDTYMdrnZTwCLcBGAs/s1600/MCU%2BStones%2BReality.PNG)

In the comics, the Reality Gem allows its user to fulfill wishes & alter reality on a universal scale.  
  
In the movies, the Reality Stone (a.k.a. the "Aether") was introduced in "Thor: The Dark World", where it is described as having "the ability to turn matter into dark matter" and supposedly the capability to turn the 9 realms into darkness. We also witness Malekith using the power of the Aether to shoot red squiggly beams at Thor, although Thor seemed mostly fine after being hit with them.  
  
Right now in MCU canon the Reality Stone is in The Collector's collection.  
  
**The Power Stone:**

In the comics, the Power Gem allows its user enhanced strength and durability, and it lets them manipulate all forms of energy. Also it boosts the effects of the other Infinity Gems when they are used in conjunction. It grants its user Omnipotence.  
  
In the movies, the Power Stone was introduced in "Guardians of the Galaxy", where it was shown to kill any beings not powerful enough to touch it. We see an celestial use it to blow up an entire planet. Also its used in the climax of the film to kill Ronan.  
  
Right now in MCU canon the Power Stone is in the Nova Headquarters on Xandar.  
  
**The Time Stone:**

In the comics, the Time Gem allows its user to see into the future or the past, slow down, speed up, reverse, or travel through time, and also trap people in unending loops of time. It grants its user Omniscience.  
  
In the movies, the Time Stone was introduced in "Doctor Strange", where it was shown to do most of the same stuff it does in the comics. We see it slow down, stop, and reverse time. Also, we see it reverse time for a particular object, as opposed to all time for everything.  
  
Right now in MCU canon the Time Stone is in the New York Sanctum, overseen by Doctor Strange.  
  
**The Soul Stone:**

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Soul Stone is either the big one or the one on his thumb                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In the comics, the Soul Gem allows its user to steal and/or corrupt people's souls.  
  
In the movies, we don't even know if the 6th Infinity Stone will be called the Soul Stone. We don't know what it does. It hasn't been introduced yet, although technically we have seen it in a clip Marvel showed at Comic Con and in some other promotional materials. That's what that picture is from.  
  
I cannot look forward to May 2018 enough. I will spend all of April 2018 talking about how excited I am for May 2018\. It's my 4 year anniversary and Marvel's Infinity War comes out. It's going to be the Best of Times.  
  
Alright! I'M DONE BABY!

### Postface

I'm going to make this into a real feature. It's going to be in the menu off to the left of the Column. It'll be all this, plus _moooore!_

  
Top 5: Things I'm Hoping for in the MCU's Future

5\. I hope they continue trending the right direction in the villain department. It's been several movies now since we've had a bland, uninteresting, unremarkable villain.  
4\. They learn their lesson from Iron Fist & The Inhumans. "Their lesson" is to not make any more _anythings_ with Scott Buck as showrunner. The first show he did was bad. The second one was terrible.  
3\. Captain Marvel & Black Panther is awesome.  
2\. Tom Holland can continue to rock it as Spider-Man... and Sony gives up on doing Spider-Man stuff without Marvel's involvement.  
1\. Marvel movies acknowledge Marvel TV... even once. Just have Coulson show back up again. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is fantastic. Give its fans a nod. Make Tony Stark aware that Coulson is still alive.

Motto: T**his Post Brought to You by ABCDFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ**  

  
Last night I told a group of pals I was with that I was going to try to craft this Column with a twist. I will clarify what I'm doing as I wrap this post up, but if you don't know what I'm doing, try to work it out - bonus points if you got it by this paragraph!  
  
Truly, this isn't all that difficult.  
  
My Mrs. is starting grad school in August. Until that point, Mrs. G is working a nifty job. It affords Mr. G (Aaron, "this guy") a lot of "guy" hours, with which I can do anything I want. Days 1 through 6, I didn't do a good job with (tons of TV and similar stuff), but on all coming occasions I am going to do accomplish lots. Goals! Know yours!  
  
Okay, this is a bit hard.  
  
Pixar's 15th film (which I saw \~10 days ago) will win awards.... as it should. It's brilliant. It's funny. It's moving. It got a bit of action going in my [nasolacrimal ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal%5Fduct) on two occasions... about an imaginary guy who is known as "Bing Bong". That's an unusual thing for a film to accomplish, and an odd way in which to do it.  
  
I look forward to fall. With any luck, "Goog"s will put out an Android product that's worth its purchasing sum. It's last product was way too big, both physically and in cost. Nobody I know has it. It was a bit of a flop. I doubt many would fight against that opinion. This is my 20th month with what's on its dock, juicing up right now.  
  
I'll cut this short, partially inasmuch as it's actually difficult to do. Ugh. What is so difficult, you might ask? Saying what you want to say without using any "E"s.

**Motto: Sometimes I Impress Myself**

  
In Columns [#219](http://www.aarongilly.com/219) and [#289](http://www.aarongilly.com/289) I shared a series of snippets from the Moleskine I had been writing in for the past year or so. Last night I re-discovered the green "Irish" notebook that Melissa gave me for our 1-year anniversary (of dating, not marriage). Reading through it last night was one of the more entertaining things I've done in a while. I'd like to share with you a brief selection of things I wrote about from \~January 2011 to \~February 2012\. This is from a time in my life before I graduated college, got a job, got married, and started doing all the projects that I write about here in the Column (also it's from before the Column). FYI - I'm going to write these quotes in the color they were in the notebook.

  
Let's begin.

  
Things I'm likely to learn from the time log:

\> You have too much time on your hands

\> The implications of E=MC2

\> Other stuff

---

It's beginning to look like the best system is just writing everything down, then reviewing the day's notes each night and making plans & arrangements then. Also, push-ups.

The chances of me using this exact sentence again any time in my life are slim-to-none – but that's only if I leave it up to chance.

  
the chances of me using this sentence again any time in my life are slim-to-none.

  
The observant man would note the two sentences were not _exactly_ the same.

  
that was not intentional.

More details on the Engineering Binder:

  
A collection of topics; the big points from each class, summarized so that older, stupid Aaron (or stupid non-Aaron people) can use it. Goal: ridiculously clear & usable.

  
It should be a mixture of typed & hand-written notes. Focusing on application & usage, not theory. Each topic should get its own definitions, equations, and example usage.

  
The finished product should be printed nicely, bound (like some Kinkos-type stuff). Also, digital copies should be saved ideally in 3 locations as well as the editable (Word) files & original drawings.

  
Steps needed:

1\. Compile list of all subjects

2\. Gather research & notes on all subjects

3. One at a time, list all topics to be detailed in the binder

4. Make rough draft of notes, including definitions, equations, example(s)

5. Make "pretty" version on word or paper

6. Archive an move on

Ø Did you or someone you know get diagnosed with something serious?

Ø Did you wreck your car?

Ø Did you get arrested?

Ø Did you break up?

Ø Did anything bad happen that you'll remember in a month?

  
A good day is any day in which…

…none of the above list happens,

…you ate food & had a drink,

…you woke up in a safe place.

  
99% of days are good days

This is a green pen. It is a gel-based "ink" distribution device. The ink is leaked onto the paper through the tip of the pen. The ink stains the paper in the exact location the pen point had touched. The ink absorbs all of the electromagnetic radiation within the visible spectrum except for some frequencies around 5.88 Terahertz (510 nm). In a way the ink works as a selective band-reject electromagnetic radiation filter. The light waves reaching our eyeballs from this ink have all frequencies removed except those in the reject region of the filter. The lack of these frequencies are what make the portions of the paper distinct. The pen does not make the paper "green", the pen shows us the paper was already green.

_Editor's note: this is full of movie quotes are clichés. It's a bit embarrassing now, but representative of Aaron at the time._

First you have to know, not fear, know that someday you're gunna die. Fear, doubt, and worry have made you a coward for far too long. Every day wasted and every night squandered you don't get back. Would you rather die? Would you rather be dead? I mean, for all that time wasted you might as well have been dead. Seize the day, seize the moment, seize opportunities – in whatever form they might come. Say "yes" more. You say "no" to life and therefore you're not living. Everything in gained through experience; and experience is gained by doing. So go do things. Go meet people. Do not tiptoe through life to arrive safely at death. Actively and intentionally seek out adventure. Have new experiences. Make new memories. You'll miss out on a lot of good times trying to avoid a few bad ones. Bad times and awkward moments are part of a full life. They are unavoidable. They are also temporary; and they, too, shall pass. When they do they leave behind them a wiser and better person. You have to be lost for a while before you can know where you are.

Motto: Keep it Simple, Stupid

  
I love .txt files. A .txt file is the simplest possible text storage on a computer. It's a file that is literally just text. No formatting. No pictures. Nothing fancy. It's the kind of file you edit in "notepad" on Windows. The file size is absolutely tiny and it can be opened with just about anything. The size of the file is just the number of characters (in bytes). Let me NOT digress for a second:  
* Computers store things in bits and bytes.
* A bit is just a 0 or a 1.
* That translates physically to a high voltage or low voltage on a memory register, or a pit or a no-pit on an optical disc.
* A byte is just 8 bits. (8 is 2^3)
* A .txt file is literally just a bunch of ones and zeros that the computer looks at, breaks up into chunks of 8 (or 16, depending upon the character encoding), then translates those chunks into characters and displays those on screen.
* A common example: ASCII character coding -> if your computer sees "01010010" it knows that means "S").
* It's just that simple. It's brilliant. So, like I said before, each byte represents a single character (in the standard coding scheme). If your .txt file is 1.183KB then it's 1183 characters long.
* It's so easy to understand. I love it.

I love .txt files.

Motto: Just Cause

  
I love a good notebook. If you have a notebook, you can do anything! Your only limit is your imagination! ...and ability ...and available real-estate per page ...and available number of pages ...and level of education ...and level inspiration ...and the properties of your writing utensil ...and free time with which to fill a notebook ...and the 2-dimensional nature of the format ...and the static nature of the medium Other than that, you can do anything! ...so long as it's either writing or drawing ...the parts of writing or drawing existing within the subset of the parameters defined above Then there's this:

Then there's this: The optimist sees the glass half full The pessimist sees the glass half empty The engineer sees the glass is twice as large as is required and/or operating at near 50% its capacity The homeless person sees the glass on the street in front of them, with not much change in it The artist sees the glass as a fascinating subject of form and refraction The table sees the glass as a hat The blind optimist feels the glass half full The dyslexic optimist sees the slags falf hull The time traveler sees the glass full, half full, empty, and broken The nerd sees the glass through her glasses The stigmatic optimist sees both glasses half full The glass blower sees a boring project The old man sees his dentures The dog sees something... possibly containing water The writer sees the glass as a metaphor exploring different frames of reference using a single, easily visualized, universally accessible scenario

Motto: This Should have been Column 365\. Shucks.  
  
It's 2019\. It's the start of a new year and a chance to take a fresh look at life.  
  
I already have my obligatory January 1st trip to the gym in. I am already writing. I'm just ticking boxes left and right.  
  
Rather than talk at great lengths about the annual tradition of looking hard into the things I want to change about myself or my life for the next 365 days... I am going to use this post to take a look back.  
  
In [January 2013](http://www.aarongilly.com/56), Melissa has just left for her 6 month trip abroad. I had just decided I didn't want to be apart from her ever again. I had a LOT of time to myself to start these long term projects.  
  
In [January 2014](http://www.aarongilly.com/132), I was engaged to be wed, and taking some well-documented intentional steps to try to expand my understanding of myself and the world. Also I was heavy into Dominion.  
  
In [January 2015](http://www.aarongilly.com/226), Melissa and I were married, living together in an apartment. Melissa and her sister celebrated New Years on a cruise ship. I decided my lack of FOMO had lead to "MO", and was bummed - so I turned my attention to building a PC. I wrote about wanting to "refresh"... In retrospect I feel like this is where I entered what could be described as a period of stagnation until late in the year.  
  
In [January 2016](http://www.aarongilly.com/277), I was fresh off a switch to a new job that I liked better. We were living in a nicer apartment. I was meeting new people with which I had common interests. I was done with the 30 Day Challenges but had a lot of goals for the year. Those goals led me to hurt myself lifting at the end of the year in attempt to meet my lifting goals. That injury would plague me for the next 6 months. Also we became homeowners this year.  
  
In [January 2017](http://www.aarongilly.com/304), I wanted to keep it simple. Comfort, Control, Competency, and Captain America. Those 4 C's quickly became 3 C's as I dropped all hopes of being competent at anything. Eventually they boiled down to "Captain America", which was loosely defined as "be more like Steve Rogers". I was enjoying my job, started playing golf and pub trivia regularly, and generally living a pretty great life. This all capped off by the end-of-year news that we were going to have a baby.  
  
In [January 2018](http://www.aarongilly.com/331), I wanted to keep it even simpler - No Zero Days. I was living a pretty good life, day-to-day, but didn't feel like I was making big strides towards my long-term goals. The No Zero Days idea was to prevent me from living a single day where I didn't make at least some progress towards my long-term goals. This, I think, was at least partially in response to the pregnancy. 2018 was a crazy, crazy year.  
  
As I write this now, in January 2019, there are three Gillespies sitting in our home office. It's crazy to think how it's all come to this moment... and to think where it will go from here.

Top 5: Goals for 2019  
5\. Start doing 30 Day Challenges again.  
4\. Do (something) to continue learning new stuff intentionally.  
3\. Continue podcasting, and work on other creative endeavors.  
2\. Spend as much time as possible with my son and wife.  
1\. Continue to be goal-focused throughout the year.

# Motto: If You're Going to Go, GoPro

Last week was a rare week. 

Actually, expand that out to last month.

Actually, expand that out to the whole last year.

I'm going to work my way forward in time and tell you what I mean.

As of the moment I'm writing this, exactly 365 days ago I was waiting outside of KU's dining hall for a shuttle bus to take my floor to showing of "The Avengers" on its opening night. It was the weekend before finals and it was the last hurrah for Templin 3. After we finally got on the shuttle and got our tickets in-hand - I had one of the most memorable nights of my life. 

Fast forward exactly 364 days into the future (yesterday) and you'd find me sitting in a restaurant on Mass Street with many of those same floor residents, waiting to go to Iron Man 3. We went to the same theater as we did the year before. We sat a couple rows up from where we did the year before. It was all very nostalgia-ey and fun.

[I wrote the column up to this point 2 days ago, from this point forward I wrote today]

Six months ago I dropped Facebook. I wrote about dropping Facebook on November 30th of last year in Column #47. I can honestly say I haven't looked back with any seriousness even once. The only motivation I have to go back are external motivators. If it were up to me, I would never go back - and it's up to me. Facebook was not useful for me and therefore I did not use it. Not having it has turned out to be everything I hoped it would be. All the justifications I gave for not having one in my 47th column have really proven themselves true in my time without one.

I don't miss it. Google+ is better.

Last week I splurged on myself. I decided it was high time that I finally got myself a couple of things I've had my eyes on for years, but have never had the money or the justification to purchase. 

1. I've been looking at televisions for forever. My computer monitor has a built-in TV tuner, so it is technically also a television - but it's not big enough for conventional "sit across the room from your TV" style TV viewing. Televisions don't shift around price much. They also don't shift in technology. The 1080p standard is going to stay for the next 5 years (at least) until 4k really makes a dent in the market. To me it didn't make sense to continue not owning a television. 

2. The second thing I bought was a GoPro Hero3 action camera. The camera is durable, high quality, and has several accessories for waterproofing and mounting. It does HD video recording, still photography, time-lapse recording, and burst photo taking. The reason I bought this camera goes back to Thailand, snorkeling with Melissa. I watched her dive down and get face-to-face with a Nemo fish. Seeing that, seeing my fiance eye-to-eye with a colorful clown fish in a coral reef in the ocean is something I will never forget. She will never get to see it, though. Neither will anybody else. I would pay more money than the camera cost me just to have had it for that one day. I refuse to ever make that mistake again. 

Here's something I made with my first hour or so with the camera:

[Editor's note: This video was lost to time]

Wedding Stuff!

Not really. There is still nothing set in stone concerning the wedding. Melissa and I are working on what we can, but our current circumstances are limiting in that capacity. As more information rolls in it will be disseminated to the proper informational repositories (I'll tell the people who should know).

The picture to go out on for this column is a picture I took of a page of my Moleskine.

![](assets/84-1.jpg)

I thought this encapsulated my personality pretty well.

# Top 5: Plans for the GoPro

5. Any/all future snorkeling/swimming/water-based activities/vacations that couldn't otherwise be filmed/photographed
4. Skateboarding super slow-mo (note: I don't want to pick skateboarding back up... I just want to film things for a day)
3. Filming my next paintball day with the boys and splicing together a highlight reel
2. Discretely recording pranks
1. Bike riding, sunsets, shooting, GIF making, dashboard mounting, snowboarding, documentary making, vacation vlogging, and filming myself tread water from under the surface so I can figure out just exactly why I'm so terrible at it.

# Motto: AAAAAAAAAAA!!!

...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!

Alright, now that I've got that out... let's get started.

This update will remain "the most recent update" for, at a minimum, the next 11 days. This is because I am traveling to infinity* and beyond**.

* infinity = Japan
** beyond = Thailand

Melissa has been in Thailand for the past 80 days. This, as you can imagine, has been a huge bummer for me. What's more, she isn't returning home for another 82 days. This, as you can imagine, is going to be a huge bummer for me. Some people can go 162 days without seeing their S.O. and be absolutely fine - but not me. That's why I'm using the first time I ever got paid vacation to travel outside of the United States for the first time to see my girlfriend for the first time in 80 days. I leave tomorrow morning and, after 30 hours of plane flights and airports, will spend the next 7 days in beautiful Thailand with beautiful Melissa. Next weekend will be like tomorrow, but played in reverse (Bangkok to Kansas City).

I'm still not fully done packing and preparing... but I'm getting there; and I could use the break.

I am equal parts excited, amped, jacked, agog, thrilled, and aflutter. Add in a double-dose of nervous and anxious for the trip, and you pretty much have explored every corner of Aaron's current emotional landscape.

![](assets/77-1.jpg)

That's Melissa. She's my girlfriend.

I am just going to leave that picture there for the next couple of weeks.

UNRELATED (but still huge in my life) TOPIC:

I taught myself to write Scripts in Google Spreadsheets. I'm still a novice by every definition of the word, but I'm picking it up quick. Years of experience writing Marcos in Excel have really accelerated the learning process. This is huge in the following ways:

It cuts one of the last remaining ties I have to Microsoft. 
My next computer could VERY EASILY be Apple-based... or I could move my current computer over to Linux if I catch wind of available prosumer-level multimedia creation programs.
GIMP is not quite Photoshop. Also: video and music creators.
My Life Tracking System is fully taking shape.
It is a Google Form/Spreadsheet with several Scripts associated with it that automatically manipulate and summarize the data in the ways I've constructed.
It moves me from the echelons of "Google power-user" to "Google Developer". 
Calling me a "Developer" is hilariously unjustified at this point... but for my projects I AM looking through reference materials hosted at the Google Developer webpage.
I can see a path of awesomeness laid out within Google's APIs.
Any other day and that would warrant much more fervor and coverage on my part. Right now, though, I've only focused on one thing.

# Top 5: Things I'm excited for over the next 10 days
5. Going to a beach house and staying for a few days at "the most beautiful beach I've ever seen"
4. Thai massages - highly reviewed
3. Exploring Buddhist temples & Bangkok
2. Seeing hilarious toilets in Japan (I'm flying to Bangkok by way of Japan)
1. Getting to see Melissa

Fun fact: I called this post "AIM Revisited" until it was nearly done, then realized that I’d already written [#401 - AIM Revisited](https://aarongilly.com/401/). Then had to re-do a lot of this post. #401 should be my first inductee into the Pantheon of Good Columns[^1] I'm actually still pleased with after all these years. It’s a good'un. Time will tell on this one. WHO KNOWS!

# New Favorite Tools

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUyw7eu9zM8soVNmQSrSt1ob_NkPVIdP6YjLLnvTo0pR8EhJ8-o0Eoi2RbfeIQJH-r2Op4qg1IfigNTulw2CIkiIEt1Adv6QCb9ZrnSUWu1X6QkdclO7IpVwHxHTV8z1IDc6GXczPtzGRZVF4TW8mT5sg=w632-h604-no?authuser=0](assets/417-1.jpg)

These tools are sorted *both* from oldest-in-use to newest, AND from most-favorite-favorite to least-favorite-favorite (if such a thing exists).

## Notion

At this point I’ve maybe written enough about Notion. Since my original ["AIM" Column, #370](https://aarongilly.com/370) in  May of 2019, Notion has completely overhauled the way I organize my personal life. It’s just great.  Everything about how Notion is built is just **exactly** how I think it should work. 

### Simple Examples

- If you type a hyphen followed by a greater-than sign, it auto-converts to an "→"
- If you have a URL copied to your clipboard and select some text in your Notion, hitting "paste" won’t *replace* that text with the URL, instead it will *turn that text into a hyperlink* pointing to the URL. I do this all the time.
- You can just, move stuff around. It’s crazy how much of a big deal this turns out to be - and it’s probably the feature I miss most about Notion when I can’t use it (e.g. at work).
- Markdown formatting. As I’ve said before, [I love Markdown](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/markdown/). Notion supports it out the box.
- Slash directives. You can quickly add *anything* just by typing "/" followed by the thing. There are a **ton** of nifty little shortcuts like that. I can type the four characters `@rnt` and get a Notification on all my devices pointing me directly to that block next Tuesday. (@RemindNextTuesday).
- I can export my entire Notion to a directory on my computer, at which point it becomes a perfectly serviceable text-based version of itself. Links are maintained via Markdown internal wiki-style linking. Photos are maintained. I’m not "locked in", and for that reason I’ll never leave. It’s ironic.
- I'm writing this post in Notion. When I copy/paste it out of Notion, it will include the Markdown necessary to maintain *all* **this** ~~formatting~~.

## VS Code

VS Code isn’t really a *new* tool to me, but it’s a new **favorite** tool. For those of you who aren’t coder-types[^2], VS Code is a text editor - which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a program that lets you write text. In particular, it excels at helping you write *code*... although you can use it quite well as [a note-taking platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) (which I would do, if Notion weren’t so damn good), or any other application of writing. And it, like Notion, has a BUNCH of quality-of-life features that enable productivity never before dreamed of. 

### Simple Examples

- Like Notion, you can do *anything* without taking your hands off the keyboard. Navigate the menus super fast, use any of the hundreds of built-in shortcut keys (or define your own), or just press `ctrl+p` and type what you want to do.
- Multi-cursor editing. Click several times in several places, and suddenly you can start typing in several places at once.
- Intellisense - Microsoft’s trademark term for smart code completion. It’s incredible and makes you feel like the bionic man when you can just type "myS" and hit tab to have it fill in the rest of "mySuperLongVariableName".
- Integration with Git & GitHub (both of which should be on this list, but I’ll spare you).
- After I finish this draft in Notion, I’m copy/pasting it from Notion to VSCode, at which point I’ll push it to GitHub. That’s what puts it here for you to read, by the way.
- Integration with all the programming languages you could ever want, including...

## TypeScript

TypeScript is *legit*. I don’t want to code a plain JavaScript app again, because *eventually* it will grow to the point that it will have benefited from the tooling features that TypeScript enables. If you’re not a coder and you’ve heard the of the coding language "JavaScript", TypeScript is basically just *better JavaScript*. I’ve really struggled to come up with an analogy that’s approachable to non-codery-types. Imagine if you had to write legal contracts, and you had a tool that prevented you from mixing up names. Or if you were doing a bibliography, and you could just tab your way through the citations. Imagine if you were writing instructions for how a thing worked, and the instructions built upon themselves such that the more you wrote the easier it became to write... or even if you built an example of a thing and the instructions for how to build it just sort of *wrote themselves along the way*.

TypeScript is sort of like that. It’s JavaScript, but with some added features. It’s something I’ve only been using in earnest for a couple months now. I love it. I'm not going back.

### Simple Examples

- You can write TypeScript using modern features, then transpile back to older versions of JavaScript, allowing you to use great time saving techniques in environments that otherwise wouldn’t allow them.
- It helps you document the code you’re writing *as* you’re writing it. The code is essentially *self-documented*. If you want it to, it’s [literally self-documenting](https://typedoc.org).
- You are super-powering Intellisense. You cannot forget to include some necessary argument in a function. You won’t forget what sort of thing a function does for you - especially with the help of the JSDoc standard, which is built into VS Code.

## Diagrams as Code

A picture is worth 1000 words. So if you can create a picture using a couple dozen lines of code, then you’ve turned a couple dozen lines of code into 1000 words. You can write some simple-to-lean code and easily turn it into complex diagrams. I’m a visual person, so I love diagrams... but changing how a diagram looks is easier when you can save version-controlled iterations of a diagram, and when you can just worry about the connections that need to be made without having to worry about how to physically **draw** them..

When it comes to diagrams as code, there are a few competing standards in the "code into pictures" arena: DOT, PlantUML, and Mermaid. I’m going to save the rest of my discussion on this for a future [Gillespedia](https://gillespedia.com) Article.

### Simple Examples

This code turns into the diagram below it:

```mermaid
flowchart 
	subgraph Notion	
	a(Page Text Content)
	c(Page Media Content)
	end
	subgraph My-Computer
	style My-Computer fill:#bbb,stroke-width:2px
	f(Google Drive Folder)
	b--saved in-->f
	subgraph VS-Code
	b(Plaintext Markdown File)
	end
	end

	subgraph Google-Photos
	d(Public Album)
	end
	c--save-->d
	d--copy/paste-link-->b
	subgraph GitHub
	e(aarongilly.github.io)
	end
	b--Git Commit-->e
```

# Motto:  You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go "according to plan." Even if the plan is horrifying!

The motto is a quote. Name the movie and get a prize (it's one of those fake internet prizes, so don't get your hopes up). The quote later on will not be a motto, though. Don't anticipate any sort of reciprocity there. It isn't happening.

Today I crossed something off my to-do list. Something that has been idling on there since before I graduated. If you've read the title of this post you probably already figured this out, but I've got that whole "job" situation lined out. Unless something weird happens, I will be starting work in September as a full-blown no foolin' Electrical Engineer. If you really care where, you can ask me in person. If you don't know me in person, then I don't care to tell you where I work. See how that works?

This brings up a strange and startling future reality: I'm going to have money. I will be making more money per unit time than I could feasibly spend by myself... even after taxes and retirement stuff is accounted for. 

The other strange and startling future reality: I'm going to have to work. I've taken a pretty extended vacation. Getting back into the swing of things at a job with responsibilities and whatnot is going to be a bit surreal. I'm not worried about it though. I'm pretty okay with stuff like that. 

From now until September 10th I'll be making final preparations for my employed life. This includes fabricating a good workout and diet plan. Financials. Uh... Other stuff too I guess.

I'll be at a gym 4 days a week. This bodes well for my "look like that swimmer guy" goal. You'll see. You'll see and you'll be like "dang". You're going to say dang. I'm calling that right now.

What am I talking about?

I should probably stop rambling and post a picture and call this column done. I'll go with one that is appropriate to mark the end of my long period of "I dunno what I'm going to do":

![](assets/26-1.gif)

I've had 3 months off. Let's just say I have a few pictures saved on my computer that will make for great postings later on. You'll see.

# Top 5: Websites to waste extraordinary amounts of time
5. netflix.com <- obvious
4. stumbleupon.com <- born and bread to be a time waster... still not the best
3. wikipedia.org <- can cause problems if you find a particularly interesting tract
2. reddit.com <- surprisingly not my top pick
1. tvtropes.org <- every single time I've gone there, I haven't returned until many hours have passed

The iPad remains my favorite device I've ever owned. It just got new superpowers. 

# Procreate Dreams

Procreate is the de-facto standard application for creating digital art on the iPad. It's the clear winner. So, when the team that built Procreate created a brand new app aimed at making *animation*, I was very excited. “Procreate Dreams” is out now. It’s a one-time $20 cost. 

Procreate Dreams aims to make animation more approachable, more discoverable, and more fun. I’ve been playing with it for a week or so now. While I’ve got no specific goal in mind yet, I’m starting to get the hang of it. I’m looking forward to incorporating “animation making” into my tool belt of creative capabilities.

Honestly if you’re buying an iPad and an Apple Pencil, you should plan on dropping $40 for both Procreate apps. They’re the best.

Here’s a dumb little animation I made.

![animation](/assets/images/446.mp4)

## That’s it.

This Column was essentially just about the Top 10 & 5 below.



# Top 10: iPad Use Cases



## 10. Taking Photos and Videos

You shouldn't do this, assuming you have a phone. But you *can*.



## 9. Gaming

Between Apple Arcade and emulation, the iPad is a capable video game console. You can pair a PlayStation controller to it and go. 



## 8. Doodling & Note Taking

There are a ton of apps for this. See [Column #430](http://aarongilly.com/430/). Infinite paper. Infinite canvas. Infinite idea capture.



## 7. Writing

This blog post was written on my iPad. It will be posted from this device, too. There are a vast number of apps you can use for writing stuff. Obsidian, Notion, and Google Docs all come to mind, but there are literally hundreds of others.



## 6. Music & Podcast Production

There are multiple levels of music production available on the iPad. You can use virtual instruments, or plug your keyboard, guitar, or whatever into it and capture your performances. Either way you can then edit it to your hearts content.

I recorded and edited my podcasts on my iPad. When I get another podcast, I will use the iPad again. Ferrite Pro.



## 5. CAD Modeling & Scanning

While people who make a living doing CAD work probably aren't going to turn to the iPad as their favorite device for doing it, I've been very successfully using it for the past few years to model projects I build before I go actually try to build them. You can even use the iPad’s Lidar scanner to capture digital representations of spaces and objects.



## 4. Video Editing & Animation

Procreate Dreams AND Final Cut Pro have both come out for the iPad this year, and have turned it into a fully-capable video content creation platform.



## 3. Proper Digital Art

People use iPads for their professional productions. Procreate. Photoshop. You can produce amazing things, and the cost of admission (for Procreate, at least) is pretty low!



## 2. Solo Movie Watching

Such an underrated way to take in a movie. Headphones and an iPad. You're locked in. It's like airplane movie experience, but without the airplane. 



## 1. Internet Browsing

The iPad is still my favorite way to browse content on the internet.



# Top 5: iPad Use Cases that Could Be Better



## 5. Gaming

Despite being more powerful than the Nintendo Switch, the iPad’s gaming **library** lacks truly compelling entries. I think the main issue is the economics don’t work out to make games that depend on external controllers, which are 100x better for “proper video game” playing than using virtual touch screen controllers. Probably 90% of folks who own an iPad do NOT own a controller that paired with it. It’s a bit of an economic chicken-and-egg problem. 

No games → no mass controller adoption. 

No mass controller adoption → no games.



## 4. Audio Recording

One mildly annoying limitation of the iPad - your audio input can’t be used by two apps simultaneously. If you’re recording a podcast while on a Zoom, you cannot also use your voice recording app.



## 3. Multi-monitor Support

This is a *mostly* solved problem if your iPad is running one of the “M” series chips. Mine is from the generation riiiight before they announced the “M1” and thus my 2nd-screen support is limited to screen mirroring only, which is not useful.



## 2. Calculator

Honestly I am filling space. There’s no built-in calculator, which is silly.



## 1. Coding

The iPad is still a crappy computer for doing coding work. There are sort of workarounds you can use, but they all are so much worse than having a proper terminal, file system, and IDE. 

Honestly if they solved this problem, I could easily see myself going in on the iPad 100%.



# **Quote:**

# Motto: Say "Yes" More

Recently, I have pulled together the messages from different movies, stories, books, and cliches into a new self-manifesto. I am vowing to be more adventurous... carpe Diem, that sort of thing. There is really a lot more I could go into about that, but I think I will refrain. Let's just say that under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something terrible has been growing. I have trapped myself in my neat little zen world and shut myself off to possibilities, and that sense of entrapment has gave rise to a sense of urgency and anxiety.

No more.

In that spirit. I am going to workout pretty soon. So this will have to be short. There are other things to get to.

I have done a little more experimenting with Android lately, and found/re-found some really good things.
See: My Top 5

I love waterbottles. My insulated Camelbak and my new 1 liter Nalgene bottle alone get me drinking nearly a gallon of water a day.

I will leave this post with a video I took on my phone. Josh had more white shirts than he wanted and decided to get rid of one.

*[editor's note from the future: this video was lost to time]*

Related note: I am going to make videos with my phone soon.

# Top 5: New Android Apps I've Discovered and Why They Rock
5. Google Earth - I've had Google Earth installed on my phone since the day I bought it, but it's only recently that I realized how undeniably impressive it is. With the updated Google Places application, the 3D buildings, and (mostly) the integration with Google's "Panoramio" service, you can look at thousands of pictures of any given monument. It's extremely impressive in person.
4. TripIt - This is an internet service and Android application. Basically it searches through your email inbox and pulls out any travel information you have in there, storing it in a much more convenient fashion. I'm travelling to Indiana soon, and I have a widget with my itinerary on it. This includes confirmation numbers, flight numbers, times, and all sorts of other useful information.
3. Evernote - I've had Evernote before, but back then I was evaluating the service as a whole. I wasn't really sold on it. Now, I've committed pretty hard into Evernote and I have to say I love it. The Android app has been updated since I installed it way back when. It's MUCH better now. It's fast and it looks nice. They covered both the obvious issues they had when I last installed it.
2. Jeanie - Pretty much a carbon copy of Apple's "Siri", Jeanie does some astonishing things. It can distinguish between "find the nearest gas station" and "what gas stations are around here". I told it to show me a picture of Abraham Lincoln. It didn't Google "Abraham Lincoln", it just showed me a picture of his face. I'm still testing what all can be done, but seriously I'm impressed.
1. SwiftKey Beta 3 - This is another app I've technically had before. I bought SwiftKey X back when it was on sale for 10 or 25 cents during one of the app sales... and I was unimpressed. The "prediction" feature didn't seem to be enough to justify the hassle of a new keyboard. I gave it another shot with the new Beta, and I must say, I love it. Not so much the prediction feature (although it also rocks) but the fact that I can blaze away at the keyboard and it autocorrects things with astonishing accuracy. Much better even than the stock ICS keyboard.

You win some, you lose some. This probably should have been *several* Columns. I hope me slapping some pretty pictures in here and the word “Feature” on the front of the title made a difference.

# Solved Problems

This is a celebration of humanity’s accomplishments. So often we talk about how we have just **screwed everything up**. We have caused global warming and the total extinction of species at a rate not too dissimilar to that achieved by a certain meteor a couple hundred million years ago… but also we have solved some real problems in ways that *(probably)* aren't really causing horrible side effects.  

Here are some uplifting examples of stuff for which you really probably should be grateful. 

## Salt

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWIYPjO95yf9OMwX61uj0ZURbQBFY5rU0wH4uDT9xt4VxvCRAGwOOymIkEtT6ZaVV1xwwRItFUyQR8IpNfZgql4CKvukb9LUhM8u7S8Vg-AsIuhZ9AnNC9dOqS_R1RCfIRuY5kNPGZbwPLTz614DviRhw=w1962-h1310-no?authuser=0](assets/423-1.jpg)

Salt used to be the stuff [literal wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_War_(1540)?wprov=sfti1) were fought over. Now I can buy enough salt to last a salt-loving family an entire year about the same price you'd expect to pay for a chicken. Salt makes food taste better, it's just that simple.

## Google Maps

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWEkot8jWyGUGZlrG-_le5ygWEDW-FuZcYhPB7qhevbMs7cE43gR_j9Yi5zolSYhcHBXDhuZ6k82wSmucruWazQen3YcQIATjq8DNf2CL_aHgkFm3VhTImw0lX0NctbZC_5vtJiYnuq9BmTvGlwPOSmdA=w1962-h1734-no?authuser=0](assets/423-2.jpg)

Google Maps is one of the best, coolest things humanity has made in my lifetime. It's the world, in rich detail. Up-to-date information about everything around you. Solving elegantly so many separate problems that used to exist. The old solutions were both less easy and less *effective*.

I still remember one of the very first iPhone commercials I ever saw was simply a demo of using your iPhone to look up food places, pick one based on its review, call the place to reserve a table, then navigate there. Immediately I thought: that is **incredible**. Now the ability to do that set of steps taken for granted. That didn't used to be easy. That used to be several very cumbersome, disconnected steps.

## Digitization & Storage Density

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXRS2GwBfPaF9P2fkr0s0kSrsfIX5zXKDvWKynecC3KVgDuGrRzwyXzhZcSK3grCjluKUEbpEBA1zU4hKylsCD8ytvQX9KNfZAftwgJxWpNghAc0uPRTgmhnpK8cnarHjWVx2GjRqAfceGvww-RHTfbag=w1000-h1500-no?authuser=0](assets/423-3.jpg)

We have invented a technology that enables you to record an entire lecture series to encapsulate that wisdom for future onto something the size of your fingernail. We used to have bookshelves dedicated to family photo albums. Now you can fit orders of magnitude more photos than that on a thumb drive. All of the text articles on Wikipedia can be compressed to 20.69 GB[^1], which means you can fit it on a $5 flash drive. It's simply amazing.

Speaking of Wikipedia…

## Wikipedia

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEVVaJlCWZgJ_ejg640X29qEBm1efCdZAakcUtzKjwocmjr8gMnvuRJMFZ5Q1H2oY_POu84pok50Q2SACSEtBPUT2QV63k_6XRmjhITf1_PA98yrS2P9MEECztFGj8WkkA58u9_Q1v5CesY3e9Py4q3Zbw=w1000-h750-no?authuser=0](assets/423-4.jpg)

Wikipedia gives me such hope for humanity. A massive collaboration of volunteers compiling and continually updating the near inexhaustible font of knowledge… it's incredible. You can get a pretty decent overview of essentially any topic, instantly, and for *free*. It's the sort of thing that was only in science fiction[^2] until about 10 years ago.

## Smallpox

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX4VcsUar0V5UUX34B_YKmFIqSiUcERifDLX2eLG0K3AKFpRMBsVYfLqhTAyIhRztG5QC31HKFG7lNMVTzciKGq71lY6diZqek7QEFq2WZMMqy9KTK18pF01CX7FKUXOjChuYCsj7v1kd9aUgA32Utjyw=w1000-h667-no?authuser=0](assets/423-5.jpg)

Hey, we got one!

# Unsolved Problems

Originally this was just a Column about solved problems. It ended here. It would have been much shorter and more nice to read if it had. So, fair warning. There's nothing forcing you to read this[^3].

## Unsexy Solutions

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEW6va68h0m6dMtb5zb2KeBLJNUXJs-G9qlQCwDTSDdaVJLAYULAToXca2J5wsozAGhj0sScQtaiLmJl-pV-oJ_lmIHiNO9rhRTTFsm-gZufdM38SUI1VghOBbKnfYB5oKLBMRzRig4BkyH7E6vKr0TROA=w1000-h1504-no?authuser=0](assets/423-6.jpg)

We have the right answers to most of what ails us. The problem is that those answers typically aren't as *easy* as they are *simple*. After having read & taken notes on [68 non-fiction books](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly-knowledge-base/bdac2b3f1b104b97ae31f2d38c4fadaf?v=a8e28ea769fb48ccb36f50f85eda8c7a)[^4], here is what pretty all of them say:

- Consistantly get enough sleep.
- Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.
- Raise your heart rate for about 30 minutes most days. Lift weights 2+ times each week.
- Spend time outside. Limit time looking at screens.
- Spend time with others who make you happy.
- Spend less money than you earn. Keep a budget. Save what you can.
- Have a calendar and a to-do list. Do weekly reviews.

If you did all of those very *simple* things, you’d avoid so many of life's biggest preventable problems… but we haven't figured out how to those *simple* things **easy**. The closest we've come (my opinion) is captured in the book ‘[Atomic Habits](http://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/atomic-habits/)’. 

## Transportation

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWB6nkFoRGWKMgw61qZ7bKGmcgDOJrt68BUrOjm2RKwYPl9mpWhkFAaM1wuHmZcJVxEuMaNuMhnzUAswiOUZ7nD3oSTtv16PSiemUvs3riEwgLGgBZxgKIDbApQ8UmTroqK_I_Th07FXWN-AdNh7WcCfg=w1000-h1500-no?authuser=0](assets/423-7.jpg)

Speaking of unsexy, another unsexy problem is simply getting things from one place to another. This remains one of the single hardest issues we face. There are so many factors that go into this, I sort of want to dedicate an entire post to it (in fact I sort of [already did that](http://aarongilly.com/179).

Damn you should read that old post I wrote. That was a great one. 

## Human Layout

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXcVt9a9_1y4oN4Ja9VV_EUYaJH4hBALXQs4_mvjBoF7SFL59sW7lx2of1CN8CpcWTrHnuFV-f4hxthYQxxD4dLijJeA4MWGHSqzWG_uT9Nx71jdMEP-8_sXd3924gvzwDEj5bLbcW9aG8YF-RTE0HnLw=w1000-h749-no?authuser=0](assets/423-8.jpg)

A huge part of the transportation problem is simply how we as a species chosen to fill all available space, often in very low-density ways. We live in places that are completely inhospitable to human life, then use energy to make it work. I’m not even talking about ‘just’ places like Las Vegas, but arguably my own home state of Kansas isn’t really all that great when it comes to living a comfortable life 8+ months out of the year. We’re dependent on heating and cooling, which is dependent on energy. 

Moreover we live far apart, from everything. _“Let’s just walk there” _or _“let’s just ride a bike there”_ has only been possible in my life when I lived on campus in college. Technically right now I’m within a bike ride of most things I need in life, but our city isn’t built around bikes. Every time I bike I put my life into the hands of everyone who drives by me. Also in their hands: their phone. So instead we drive 3000 pound vehicles to take our 150 pound bodies to buy 25 pounds of food, then drive back. Expending >90% of that energy just to move the *car* to and from the grocery store, as opposed to its contents.

The “American dream” of owning a house and one car per adult is _wildly inefficient_ from a resource use perspective. The cost of having your *own* house, cars, and land means that most people need large pieces of capital equipment that mostly just ‘sit around’ for the vast majority of their lives. A lawn mower that’s properly maintained could service a lawn area equivalent to hundreds of homes if it were run full time. Instead we all collectively buy 100 lawn mowers, use them each an hour a week or less, and pay to maintain them separately. Each of us owning land means we live far apart from everything, which makes ***not*** owning a car infeasible. I’ve read from a few different sources now that estimates put the total space allocated towards streets and parking in an average American city at around **50% of all available space**. That sucks.

And I’m 100% guilty of all of the above.

I have a home and a lawn mower I have to maintain. Not to mention the weed eater, two air conditioners, more furniture than I could possibly hope to use all at once, and dozens-to-hundreds of other examples of nice things I’ve surrounded myself with that I don’t “need” to survive… at least not in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word.[^5]

I have to drive 45 minutes to my job. Then another 45 minutes back home. Before we got the Tesla this ~95 mile round trip amounted to 4 gallons of gas, or 78 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted, and a personal cost to me of about $17 and 90 minutes of my life every workday. With the Tesla, those ~95 miles translate to about 27 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> for power generation, and a personal cost of ~$3.25 (still 90 minutes of my life, though).

The work from home revolution that came with COVID-19 showed a large swath of the population that working from home was not only _possible_, but 100% **better** than commuting. Telepresence cannot replace physical presence entirely, but I reckon it can do ~80% of the work. Days on which I can work from home I spend functionally zero dollars to get there and back, and my commute is zero minutes. 

## Bad Economic Incentives

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWVz2VPTO8uc96DCIW-lZvgqhUwneSuewpcWtBY2qwCdBDBnAkc6qW8bA7ZY2W1wZs64svrhTGxylAOdDQXY0PA-Q-bwoXjvtymKSs0Ahyxj3_7VEeT9FjKrMFu5RlrbTWSKyVtlyunBCdaFL_teN4yyw=w1000-h667-no?authuser=0](assets/423-9.jpg)

One of the fundamental truths of economics is that *‘actors respond to incentives’*. People opt for the least expenditure of resources for whatever result they desire. 

You want a banana, you choose the $0.50 banana instead of the $1.00 banana. 

You want to make money running a lemonade stand, but the kid down the street *also* has a lemonade stand. You have choices: 

| **Action**                                      | **Cost**                                | **Risk of Failure** |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Undercut their price                            | Lowered margin, fiscal opportunity cost | Low                 |
| Spend more effort advertising                   | Advertising expense & energy costs      | Medium              |
| Spend effort trying to make your product better | Energy cost and likely expense          | High                |
| Burn down your competitors lemonade stand       | Essentially none                        | Very Low            |

But one of those things is not like the other. We live in a society that recognizes that 2 lemonade stands competing will drive a better product at a better price for consumers. Burning down a lemonade stand doesn’t provide that, and creates real problems for the victim. Those problems lead to potential for violence and blah blah blah you get the picture.

Thus: **laws**.

Laws are meant to step in counteract the incentives for bad behaviors. You'd hope in the lemonade stand example basic morality would prevent you from burning down the lemonade stand of the kid down the road, but if that's not good enough you now have to weigh the strong likeliness that you'd face some sort of civil or criminal lawsuit. Thus your incentives for societal-value-reducing-behavior are (hopefully) nullified… but not everyone agrees on what we should incentivize and how. In my view, this is >50% of what arguments in politics really boil down to.

As a rule, I try not to go into politics here on the general internet. I won’t break that rule here. Suffice to say, there are some bad economic incentives happening at all levels. 

This isn’t even going into things like the fact that it costs more money and time to eat a good, healthy, home-cooked meal from raw sources than it does to buy a couple of McDoubles.

## Global Warming

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEUWC99hLwMEWzd2HP4AUXiXulbOCHty8q7PtW6v53h801_0qd5BR4qAp_FSfXzO0RDTXOsnzX6aBmeNRrmC7tMeDZ5l7D7TzM5MvesPfKZ-3al33bHR_1eYqY7epN_3PpUfEB41v-m_JkAUCp-1wKyDEw=w900-h600-no?authuser=0](assets/423-10.jpg)

This Column got way too long. This is somehow the last sentence I’m actually writing before posting it - so [this link is all I’ll leave you with](https://www.un.org/actnow).

## Cancer

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEV65VoSXGMKP4DEsD9fX7-pCcXSXcxh-0mWclIvm3t8uKTkcIlTMO5j0BJN4DvWOIf7IS27vpnEX7TDWB-xXKknRTDseeB_Zg0PfEQOvN_XQgFXqXZ4D_LyaymvhW2VxdvAjW6tgBfbr4YeeYiwXNwxLg=w1000-h667-no?authuser=0](assets/423-11.jpg)

Nothing new to say here. It just deserves to be in every list like this. 



# Top 5: Random Other Thoughts

3 of the 5 of these are fairly negative. Sorry about that.



## 5. Absence Is Required

“Absence makes the heart grow fonder” could just as well be phrased as “lack of absence makes you insane”. In a world without scarcity, nothing matters. I don't envy the mega rich. 

We took a cruise last month. By the end of it I was actually _annoyed_ at having to finish fancy fun drinks and eat incredible food that I didn't prepare and didn't have to clean up after. “Nothing ventured nothing gained” doesn't really apply here, but without some form of effort expended to achieve a thing… the thing becomes functionally meaningless pretty quickly. 



## 4. Absence is Required Part 2

I took care of my boys by myself for a week. I love my kids. They are the light of my life. By the end of day 4 I was **struggling** to handle the minorest of behavioral issues… stuff no kid should ever get in trouble for was setting me off. My 3 Year Old was being granted zero leeway to be three years old - and that made me really disdainful of his caregiver (myself).

That began a cycle of the snake eating its own tail. I was upset that I was getting so easily upset, which caused me to be upset. How do you apologize to a 3 year old for being short with him just for wanting your attention? The answer is you _can't_ really. Understanding where I'm coming from requires 25+ years on this earth, and even then most people would struggle not to take it personally. 

So I just half to chalk that one up as an “L” and try to overpower it with hugs and tickles and games of hide and seek going forward. You need to maintain a ratio of at least 5:1 positive to negative experiences with the people you love. 



## 3. My Biggest Pet Peeve

Automated phone trees are terrible, but the absolute WORST thing is when a phone tree has the **audacity** to pretend like it's not a phone tree. If you ask me to describe my problem in detail, then play fake typing noises after I stop talking while you process my input to pass off like someone was actually listening to me and diligently transcribing my words… it makes me want to spike my phone on the ground. 

Phone trees are bad. Phone trees that lie about what they are are the **worst**. 



## 2. Cars 2 - Pixar’s Worst

This is not new territory, but I just had to watch this movie for the 10+th time. 

**Cars 2 is terrible.** It was a bad idea that was clearly forced into production for commercial reasons, not artistic ones. They had no idea what story to tell and the choices they made sucked. 

It centers around the comedic relief from a previous movie, a primary ingredient in the recipe for a bad sequel. Another ‘bad story’ primary ingredient - it hinges on an unbelievable “post-it note could solve it”-type misunderstanding for 4/5th of the movie (where the secret agents think Mater is also a secret agent). 

Tonally and in theme it's a massive departure from the movie before it, which is one of Pixar's best. 

One of the “morals” of the story is that Lightning shouldn't have expected Mater to not be a loud annoying interrupting menace to everyone, which just isn't true. Mater was in the wrong on that one and completely deserved to get dumped on. And the “hero” of the movie Mater wins the day with incredibly reckless behavior based on a hunch. If he had been wrong, his gambit would have killed a bunch of people (including The Queen in the Cars universe).

Cars 2: **1 1/2 stars**



## 1. 3rd Eye Blind Were Mindfulness Enthusiasts

The 3rd eye is a symbol of extra-sensory perception that has been used by various cultures going way, way back. The 3rd eye allows you to perceive that which is not in front of you.

One way to think of mindfulness is that it's about being grounded in the present. Being mindful requires noticing the things that are around you. Not living in the past, the future, or elsewhere in the present. 

So if your 3rd eye is blind, I guess you're about as mindful as they come. You're not seeing anything that isn't right in front of you. 

After reading that - if you did not want to see me again, I would understand. 

I would understand.

# Motto: Nobody’s perfect… I guess this extends to corporations, too.

Google launched their new Nexus lineup on Tuesday. They went on sale 25 minutes before they were supposed to… and by the time they were ACTAULLY supposed to be on sale, they were literally SOLD OUT of the Nexus 4. I took an extra early lunch to make sure I’d be able to order one. I got there 10 minutes before they were supposed to start selling. It was already too late. I didn’t get one. Their Play Store was decimated by thousands and thousands of people trying to get their order in. My attempts were all futile. I’m just trying to give you my money, Google, why must you make it so difficult!

![](assets/43-1.gif)
TAKE IT!

Not all was a loss, though. I was able to order a new Nexus 7 to replace my current Nexus 7. Why do that? I have hookups for a great rate on my phone bill. The Nexus 7 I have coming in the mail will be able to hook into that plan, whereas the one I have right now doesn’t offer that capability. I won’t have two tablets, by the way. I have a plan for the first one. It’s pretty genius.

Speaking of the Nexus 7 I already have; it got the update to Android 4.2 last night. This brings it all the new features of Android 4.2 that aren’t camera-related. I am a HUGE fan of all the new features. I also have notice several small UI changes throughout the system that make it more polished overall. It’s smarter. It’s matured. It’s perfection.

I can remove the “.blogspot” from my blog’s URL for $10/year. Doing so would also give me the option to have a cool “me@aarongilly.com” email address to use for whatever purpose. I will probably do that at some point down the road.

A while back, my best friend asked “If you had a year to go do whatever you wanted, and at the end of that year things would go back to the way they were before,  what would you do with it? After the year was over, you couldn’t keep anything you acquired other than knowledge, skills, and memories. Let’s assume money isn’t a factor, but that is not to say you have infinite money.” It is a great question. I thought I’d share with the general internet a majorly shortened version of my answer:

I would break my year down into six 2-month sections. During each of these sections, I would move to an entirely different part of the country/world and embrace an entirely different way of life. I would live in California, own all Apple products and try to make my name in the movie industry. I would live in Alaska, with nobody around for miles, and read books and whatnot. I would live alone, with a few buddies, and in 6 very different style domiciles. I would try out all the technological ecosystems available, one per section. I would basically take a very interesting 2 months out of the life of another version of the person I could have been, had circumstances have been different. During this whole process I would keep a very detailed diary. Afterwards, I would change take all the things I liked from each of the six experiences and pull them together to live out the rest of my life as a well balanced hybrid of systems and ways of living, each thoroughly tested for 2 months. I would take my diary and my newfound knowledge and I would write a book about my experience. That's what I would do.

That's my answer. You should think about how you would answer that question. It's a good mental exercise, if nothing else.

# Top 5: Things that annoy me that really shouldn't
5. When people walk on their toes. It makes them look like they are constantly falling forward. They look out of control and it makes me uneasy.
4. When people chew loudly and/or with their mouth open.
3. When something that could easily be neat, isn't. Example: a wadded up cable that has a cable tie on it. Why not use the tie? It's so much neater.
2. When GOOGLE RUNS OUT OF THE NEXUS 4 AFTER 20 MINUTES.
1. When I make a reference to a popular movie and nobody gets it. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

Bonus thing I just thought of: When people write in all caps.

# Motto: The movie “Big Fish” sucked.

I don’t want to start the column off with a downer, so how about a short joke?   What’s brown and sticky? A stick.   Now that we’re all happy, I’m going to list off a few things that annoy me: · Windows that you can’t resize on your computer. I can understand in some circumstances why some windows aren’t resizable. Creating a sleek and scalable UI takes time and skill, for smaller portions of the program, there may not be a good reason to do so. I’m okay with a settings menu that isn’t resizable. What I’m not okay with is a “choose a file from your computer” window that isn’t scalable. When your program tells me to pick a picture out of my picture library that literally contains thousands of pictures, it BETTER not restrict me to seeing two thumbnails at a time. · People or companies that try to sell you things online, then include only 3 or 4 low quality pictures of the item. Even worse – when they include ONE picture, and when you click on the picture to “see a bigger size”, it opens up a big new window, then shows the same tiny picture in the middle of it. If you are going through the trouble of making a product, the least you could do is go through the trouble of putting representative imagery online. I was looking at bookbags online for my girlfriend (whose travelling abroad soon) and the product images were always “exterior only” shots. What person would want to see IN the STORAGE portion of the BAG they are trying to buy, anyway?
· I have a burn or a cut or something on the roof of my mouth. It would heal if I could just stop tonging it. I am naming it Marla.
· Pinky toes. They only exist to get stubbed.  In positive news: · I was listening to Pandora the other day on my Android tablet. I pulled up a YouTube video, then thought “Oh, I’m going to have to pause Pandora to listen to this video”. To my happy surprise, Pandora paused itself when the video started. It even resumed after the video was over – something I NEVER remember to do.  I like it when technology does that sort of thing. · I downloaded an Android app that lets you record Gif images. I can now make my own reaction Gifs.   Last two bits:   I gave my Galaxy Nexus to my father December 15th. I bought that phone last year… on December 15th. The 1 year warranty was on its last day when we went to the phone store and had them order a new one for free (the one I had was having radio issues). You can’t say I keep phones for less than a year. However, I can’t say I keep them for more than a year.   I think the internet is Egyptian because everyone on it worships cats.

This Column is pretty singularly focused. I wrote it alongside a bunch of other stuff. I extracted this section for this post, and expanded on it a bit as I refine the other half for the next one. They were super unrelated.

Note: none of this is sponsored and I don't make any money off these links... because I'm too lazy to do the work that would be required to make the $1 I'd feasibly be able to make from it. I don't advertise on this site.

# Home Gym Order of Priorities

My home gym is everything I have ever wanted in a home gym *(except bumper plates and vertical space)*. Now that I have “completed” the “ideal”[^1] home gym that I dreamt up a decade ago and have lived with it for a year, here's what I would recommend to someone who was in the same boat I was in a few years back: just getting started with in-home fitness.

The situation is you're slowly accumulating stuff to build your home gym. You don't want to get something then later have to replace it with something else. This is the order in which I would procure my gym equipment. As you progress down the list, each step you take opens up new options, doesn't replace anything that came before it, and at any point you stop you'll have something cohesive you can work with. 

## 1. A Yoga Mat

If you only have 1 piece of equipment, a [yoga mat](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extra-Thick-Exercise-Carrying/dp/B01LP0U5X0/ref=sr_1_1_ffob_sspa?crid=3IEPNTI5XBVU5&keywords=yoga%2Bmat&qid=1680619684&sprefix=yoga%2Bmat%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQk80QlhPUTFWNURJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjMzMzU3MzYySllKWjAzQ0NSSCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDQ5NTk5T0Y4WldTSkREWjZCJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) the best one. It's cheap, and small. You need a space to workout. Even if it's not yoga. Rolling out the yoga mat is a great way to get your mindset right. You aren't in your living room any more, you're on your mat. Whether you're doing yoga or calisthenics, you'll benefit from having a place to do them. When you're done, you can reclaim that spot on the floor and stow it away.

Melissa got me an oversized yoga mat to fit my oversized frame. I love that thing. 

## 2. Olympic Rings

Next up, I recommend a pair of [olympic rings](https://www.amazon.com/PACEARTH-Gymnastics-Adjustable-Non-Slip-Training/dp/B07CGCD7JH/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1B1VSX6GQ09NP&keywords=olympic+rigs&qid=1680619533&sprefix=olympic+rings%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-2). Like a yoga mat, these are cheap, light, and space saving. Useful for pull-ups, dips, inverted rows, stability push-ups, and lots of stuff I can't do. If you don't have a place to hang them, you'll have to make one. It's not too damaging to find some joists in the ceiling and hang up some [$6 anchor points](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-1-1-2-in-Steel-Wire-Ring-Anchor-Point-in-Black-4-Pack-FH1121B/312994392).

## 3. Adjustable Dumbbells

You can go with the [handle + weights + locking collars kind](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Adjustable-Barbell-Dumbells/dp/B071WSFSGC/ref=sr_1_11_ffob_sspa?keywords=adjustable%2Bdumbbells&qid=1680619870&sr=8-11-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQVE3TUxKS0pSQ0VBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTQwNTU1VFpTTFJKSjFNQ04xJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwMTAxMzAxRVJXQlNTWE5GVFQ5JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) or the [dial-a-weight kind](https://www.amazon.com/Bowflex-SelectTech-Adjustable-Dumbbells-Pair/dp/B001ARYU58/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=adjustable+dumbbells&qid=1680619818&sprefix=adjustable+du%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-5). I have the most popular/common type of dial-a-weight ones and I do like them. 

We also have regular non-adjustable dumbbells, which are another option if you've got the space. Having both allow my wife and I to do the same workouts at the same time. When we do, I take the adjustable ones and they absolutely do the job.

## 4. An ADJUSTABLE Bench 

[Adjustable benches](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=adjustable+weight+bench&sprefix=adjustable+weigh%2Caps%2C122&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_16) are more expensive than flat ones, but much better. A flat bench isn't all that different from a stool. Adjustability is obviously necessary for things like incline presses and flies, but it also allows you to use the bench for stability while doing standing exercises, you can lean against it for reverse dumbbell flies, and it provides back support for overhead pressing movements (if back support is desired).

## 5. Floor Mats

At this point you need to start dedicating space. Having a place you go to exercise makes all the difference. You can start with [foam mats](https://www.amazon.com/Mat-Block-APM002GY-Interlocking-Protective/dp/B0BGXDZCJ1/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=5IBANZLQA5TC&keywords=gym+flooring&qid=1680620130&sprefix=gym+flooring%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-4-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMURFTlRBSU9XOUhWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTUxMDg5M0NCR1hHSE05SFhPRSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTcyNTc1Mk1MTzVZTk1STVlNWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) or go straight to rubberized “[horse stall mats](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/4-ft-x-6-ft-x-3-4-in-thick-rubber-stall-mat)”. I started with foam and moved up to the horse stall mats. Having both is **not** a bad thing.

Foam mats are obviously cheaper and easier to work with, but have a limited lifespan. If/when you're upgrading to horse stall mats, do yourself a favor and also buy some plastic [vapor barrier](https://www.amazon.com/Frost-King-P1025-6W-Polyethylene/dp/B0040ZC5AO/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2FWQDEBF017CY&keywords=vapor+barrier&qid=1680620274&sprefix=vapor+barrier+%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-5) to prevent mold from growing on the bottom.

## 6. A Mirror

Honestly [a mirror](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Glacier-Bay-36-in-W-x-60-in-H-Frameless-Rectangular-Polished-Edge-Bath-Mirror-81178/316331983) maybe should be higher up the list. Being able to see yourself for form checks and motivation is critical in a home gym setup and one of the things that made me really start to feel like I was in a *gym*, as opposed to a room with exercise equipment in it.

If you've got an American flag, chuck up there too. Cause all home gyms in America are legally required to fly a flag.

# Next Big Purchases

Once you've accumulated everything above, you've got a perfectly respectable home gym for basic strength training, yoga, and HIIT-type workouts. From there, honestly, it gets **super** subjective and in accordance with your specific goals. *Also* it starts to get pretty expensive pretty fast. 

## Cardio Options

If you want to maintain better cardiovascular health and you don't live in a place that's suitable to doing outdoors stuff, the next thing might be a large piece of cardio equipment. There are a few types to consider.

**Treadmills** - the classic treadmill [may have been invented as a tourtue technique](https://www.businessinsider.com/treadmills-torture-device-prisoners-treadwheel-victorian-britian-crime-prison-2017-4), but they allow you to maintain a steady-state cardiovasular workout routine throughout the harshest months of the year.

**Stationary Bikes** - these are incredibly popular lately thanks to the pandemic & Peloton's effective advertising. They are good for both steady-state cardio workouts and can be used as part of a HIIT routine. These may be a bit easier on your joints than a treadmill, and thus would be my preferred option in almost all cases.

**Rowing Machines** - rowing machines are a world of their own. There are water-based machines, air-based machines, and ones that rely on magnetic resistance. Like the stationary bike they can be used for both HIIT and steady-state type work. Unlike the stationary bike and treadmill, a rowing machine also works your upper body. From my experience, though, they can be agitating to those of us who are prone to lower back issues.

**Elliptical Machine** - I hate elliptical machines. I'm 6'9". They do **not** work for me egonomically. Also, they have big "don't actually get used" energy. However, they can be easier on your joints and are necessary to include on this list - even if it's just for the sake of completeness.

## Strength Options

If you want to be stronger, nothing really can replace heavy weights. Like everything else, there are many options you can consider. Most of the options below also require olympic bars and plates. If you can afford to, get rubberized plates - or even better - get bumper plates.

**Full Power Cages** - these are essentially a rectangular prism that you can stand in while you lift heavy weights. They prevent catastropic failure from occurring. They've got adjustable pins that physically prevent you from being crushed by a failed squat. If you fall backwards you're still caged in so you won't drop the weights on whatever is behind you.

**Half Racks** - the difference between the power cage and the half rack is where you're expected to be standing when you lift. Half racks expect you to stand in front of them, not inside them. They are therefore much easier to get the barbell out of for things like deadlifts. This is what I have and what I generally prefer.

**Strongman Yokes** - strongman yokes are to half racks what half racks are to power cages. They are a step down in terms of size and weight. They're not a rectangular *prism*. They're just a rectangle. The main difference between a strongman yoke and the two options above is that the yoke is designed to be picked up as part of the exercise itself. 

**Smith Machines** - again included for completeness. A Smith Machine is essentially a barbell integrated into a squat rack. They have the benefit of providing additional stability and arguably some added safety, but they also are prone to putting your body into awkward lifting positions. Most people don't recommend smith machines, but they're common in commercial gyms for insurance reasons (I assume).

**Cable Machines** - this is a category of machines in which cables on pulleys are attached to weights that only ever travel up and down. They can be giant and expensive, or [relatively simple and modest](https://www.amazon.com/Valor-Fitness-BD-62-Mount-Station/dp/B01LOX2PPO?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=ATV6SMY1XYVCJ). They can be very versitle, but aren't as effective as simple free weights in my experience. 

I got a corner cable machine, whose purchase I only mildly regret. It's useful, but not as useful as I'd hoped. The prospect of ever moving it already stresses me out. If I could do it again I'd probably save some money and go with the one I linked to above.

## Specialty Machines

From there, get whatever your favorite piece of equipment you don't already have is. This list could be insanely long and quickly hit diminishing returns. Suffice to say, if you've got money and space, there is a gigantic and vast array of leverage machines, sleds, glute-ham stations, dip bars, and so on and so forth.

Then you'll have your own little slice of exercise heaven.

# Top 5: Other Home Gym Setups for Different Situations



## 5. Power Cage + Olympic Bar + Plates + Nothing Else

If your goal is to get strong, like really strong, you'll need access to heavy weights. With just a bench & squat setup you've got everything you need to hit the Big 6 lifts[^2]: Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Bent-over Rows, & Chin-ups. These + bodyweight fitness-type moves, yoga, and a mixture of cariodvascular workouts (all of which can be done with **no** equipment) are really all you'd ever need for a good level of overall fitness.



## 4. The Total Gym

The "Total Gym" is a fun inclusion on this list. I don't own one, nor have I actually tried a legitimate workout on one; but I'm such a fan of the design. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's basically a cable machine where your body is the weight. You sit or lay on a padded cart that's attached to an inclined plane. You can adjust the resistance levels by adjusting the angle of the machine. In reality I'd bet they're a bit annoying and I wouldn't want to actually ever own one - but they get included here just because I love the idea. 



## 3. A Few Kettlebells

I've never been a kettlebell user, but I understand their appeal and have seen people get very good workouts in using kettlebells. They are a great supplement to a HIIT workout and functional fitness exercises.



## 2. Resistance Bands

Another great option not mentioned anywhere above this, resistance bands are a relatively cheap, incredibly light weight and surprisingly effective form of restistance training. Even if you're a nomad who lives from hotel room to hotel room, you could feasibly buy a [set of high-quality resistance bands](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-resistance-bands/) and keep a gym in your backpack. 



## 1. None

You are your own gym. [/r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness)

[^2]: Not my concept. It's also debated if it's the Big 3, Big 4, Big 5, or Big 6. I like the symmetry of the Big 6 being for a lower body push & pull, and an upper body push and pull for both horizontal and vertical directions. While there's still some variation within "the Big 6", they do generally break down to those 6 types of exercises. [Source 1](https://ss.fitness/#the-big-six).

# Adding Ads
For forever I've been anti-putting ads on my site. I thought: 
*why annoy the few people I know and love who read this just to make $2/year?*

Well, it turns out there are more than the "few people I know and love" who read this. If that's you, hi. 

It *also* turns out that my "$2/year" assumption ***may*** have been grossly wrong. I don't know. I've done some Googling and looked at the numbers for my site... and it's a complete mystery to me what amount of money I'm turning down by sticking to my "ads suck, why annoy people?" ethos.

So I'm running an experiment with ads on my blog.

Come March, I will look at the numbers again and make a decision about whether or not it's "worth it" to me to keep this site ad-free. Perhaps this Column (like many before it, actually) will go down as a weird relic that reflects some very specific contemporaneous thing.
# Other News

## Semantic Canvas Plugin Update
I updated [my Obsidian Plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=semantic-canvas), implementing some feature requests. Turns out it's used by a few thousand people... which is cool. 

## Life Tracker Refactor Number 11 Continues
In [[461|Column 461]] I wrote about a "Rabbit Hole" wherein I decided to change something about the core structure of my [[PDW]]. That's still on-going, but at this point also sort of done? It's complicated. At some point I'll update that page with a new grand expose of how it works.

## Vacation
I need one. Maybe ads will help pay for one. Who knows. 

## New York Times Games
The New York Times games app is fun. Installed it. I'm not paying for it, which is a great way to get access to some games, but also not access to *infinite* games, which can be problematic.

A very focused Column! For once!
# Challenges

As a surprise to nobody who knows me, I’m a fan of self-imposed temporary challenges. I have a Notion database where I’ve tracked my challenges, what they were, when they took place, what areas of my life they were meant to impact, and how successful they were. There are 90 entries.

> [!success] I’ve done 2,700 days of “challenges”, and counting.

I have already done a pretty comprehensive retrospective on challenges in [Column #377](377)[^1] in which I cover what 30 Day Challenges *are*, remember some of the best ones I’d done, and make suggestions for implementing challenges for yourself. This post isn’t about that.

## Challenges & *Change*

Time boxed challenges are all well and good. You do a thing for a week, or 30 days or whatever[^2], but then you’re done. The *cynic* would say “sure you did dry January, but come Feb 1st you’re the same person you always were”. To some extent, this is always true and inevitable. The point of any time boxed challenge isn’t to experience some step function change - suddenly and irrevocably becoming a whole new and better person *forever*. The idea is to try something *new.* To try it for long enough that you can actually experience what *living in that new space* is like. To be there long enough for the messages in the feedback loop to stabilize. All the while, learning things and having new experiences. 

The reality is, even if you throw out 100% of the new behaviors adopted during the challenge, you’ll have learned *“this way of living is not for me”*. That’s a valuable lesson. 

![[456-1.png]]

More likely, you *will find **something*** during the challenge you like, there will be at least some tiny bit you will retain.

![[456-2.png]]

When you do enough of these, you get something that would make James Clear very happy:

![[456-3.png]]

## Challenges & *Project Sprints*

Sometimes challenges are to give you a reason to do something you've been wanting to do, but too intimidated to start. Many of my biggest accomplishments came as a direct result of 30 Day Challenges. Something about saying “okay, this is the month for this hard thing” makes it seem, well, less *hard*. Maybe because the point of it all is that it’s supposed to be *hard*. Or perhaps because of the **focus** the challenge gives to its singular purpose. You’re not faced with a tidal wave of big projects you can’t really progress, instead you’ve selected **one** you can make meaningful progress on.

Some examples:

- Migrated financial services
- Drew recognizable faces
- Moved house
- Migrated my notes from Notion to Obsidian
- Rebuilt my PDW app
- Held a garage sale

You can also use 30 Day Challenges as means to *schedule* when you’ll do one of those “someday” projects. One of those things you’ve been meaning to get around to, but there’s no urgent triggering action - you could knock it out simply because it’s *September*.

WIthout an excuse to focus - you end up with a giant pile of “maybe could do this now”.

![[456-4.png]]

The challenge is a great way to focus in, and push everything else to back of mind. I love this approach.

Some examples:

- Migrated financial services
- Drew recognizable faces
- Moved house
- Migrated my notes from Notion to Obsidian
- Rebuilt my PDW app
- Held a garage sale

You can also use 30 Day Challenges as means to *schedule* when you’ll do one of those “someday” projects. One of those things you’ve been meaning to get around to, but there’s no urgent triggering action - you could knock it out simply because it’s *September*.

![[456-5.png]]

## Challenges & *Memory*

The purpose of challenges isn’t always about making grandiose changes, self improvement, making massive progress on some large project - one of the best reasons to do challenges is to make new memories. Routine is the enemy of memory. Challenges by their nature ask you to do get *out* of your routine. Simply by doing something different, you are more prone to doing things you’ll remember. 

You can (and *absolutely should*) go on great & big vacations to make memories, but you don’t **need** to big vacations to do things you’ll remember. 

This week we walked to our local grocery store in the rain cause 75 Hard. I will remember that. Honestly, not at all bad. We've gone to new places in town, found new trails to hike that were *right* by our house, tried new gyms, ate new foods, and learned all about ourselves (& the world) thanks to challenges. 

## Right now

Right now Melissa and I are one month in on our 75 Hard challenge. It's been *hard*, but also it's been *possible* thanks to the mutual support Melissa and I have had for each other. We are approaching the 1/2 mark, going strong. 

Also it turns out if I work x2/day I get crazy fit. I don't normally share bragadocious photos, but check this out:

![[456-6.png]]

Not an ounce of fat on that.



# Top 5: Starter Challenges

If you're interested in challenging yourself here are some great ideas to get you started.



## 5. Buy a nice journal, write in it every night.

Journaling is an excellent habit. Writing about your ideas, thoughts, about your day... getting thoughts out of your head and onto paper - it all works. It has a way of helping you grow the ideas, or yourself.



## 4. Don't eat out Monday through Thursday

If you have a habit of going out for lunch or dinner during the week, try to curb that. Bring your lunch. Make your dinners and save the leftovers. Save money and learn which foods make for the best leftovers.



## 3. Do the house project

If you have a house, you have a house project you haven't gotten around to yet. Go do it. If you have an apartment, you probably have one, too.



## 2. Break a sweat every day

This one is great because it scales with your ability & gives you a lot of latitude in *how*. You mowed? Check. You went for a walk? Check. You did 5 sets of pushups to failure? Check.



## 1. Get off social media

Then just don't get back on.

# Motto: "Apple iPad Mini" is an anagram of "Animal I Pipped" - and I'm not sure what that means.

This needs to be short because it's a weeknight and I have a job. I have a tendency to ramble on about things in general, and it's worsened when I talk about something I'm really interested in. This post is about things I'm interested in. Not like all those other boring posts.

Today, Apple announced nearly all of its non-iPhone products to be released for this holiday season. Later this week: Microsoft officially announces Windows 8 & Windows Phone 8 and Google announces "something" which may be/definitely is a trio of Nexuses. I will cover all those announcements with my skewed opinions like I have this one.

THE NEXUS 7 VS THE IPAD MINI (in the most condense way possible)

(this image is lost to time)

Note: I pulled this image from this article on ComputerWorld. I like to give credit where it's due.
Outline of the iPad Mini's advantages:

A much better developed tablet application ecosystem
It's thinner, lighter, and many would argue more "beautiful"
A backfacing camera (which I would argue is pointless)
A bigger screen with a smaller bezel
More storage options
The option for a cellular connection
Dual-band wifi
iOS 6
Outline of the Nexus 7's advantages:
A higher resolution screen, effectively showing more content at once (this also means a better PPI, which is funny given Apple's love for PPI since the original retina display)
A quad-core processor, which has been more recently developed than the iPad Mini's throwback processor
A smaller overall form factor for better portability
It uses a standard MicroUSB connector (some would say "big deal", but finding one of these will be way easier than finding Apple's lightning connector for a long time)
GPS - the iPad Mini has GPS, but only on the more expensive LTE enabled option
The price: $250 - and that's not even the cheapest option, it's just the one that matches the wifi-only iPad in terms of storage
Android 4.1
Advantages that the iPad Mini will likely lose by the end of this week (what the Nexus is likely getting):
Higher storage options for the same (low) price, rumor is they are doubling the storage available at the two tiers and keeping the price the same
An option for cellular connection
Android 4.2
No matter which way you swing it, these are two very compelling products that I think could (and should) become more popular (in terms of opinion) and more prevalent (in terms of market share) than their bigger siblings. When I switched from my 10" Asus Transformer to my 7" Nexus, I thought I was going to hate it. It turned out to be so far the opposite direction that I am still surprised on a daily basis how much better I like it. The 7-8" form factor is where it's at, yo.

I argued with an Apple fanatic on Google+ for an hour right before this post. He was staunch Apple and I represented the Android side of the coin. We argued about differing specs and their varying levels of importance. We argued about arguments. After a while, we came to terms with the other's viewpoints and let bygones be bygones. It was interesting getting insight into the mind of an Apple Fanboy that actually knew the variables of the equation on both sides. I think I need people like that to balance me out sometimes. The whole experience struck me as being oddly natural. The two of us are set to debate tacos vs. burritos sometime next week.

# Top 5: Things Apple announced today by how much I care about them.

Most of this Column is about my continued love[^1] of the iPad Pro. If that's too consumerist for you, skip to the heading "Non-iPad Stuff".

# The iPad

In the realm of devices I've ever owned, the iPad I'm writing this Column on stands above anything else in terms of how much I love using it. I've owned some great devices in the past (see the [Top 5](#top5most-loved-devices-ive-owned), but none have been this versatile and fun. No other device have I ever gone out of my way to use this much. I feel like I could be stuck in a windowless room with a this iPad/Apple Pencil combo, a USC C cable, WiFi, and a desk and I'd be content indefinitely. Nothing else I've ever owned I can say that about.

For context, I am using the 4th generation iPad Pro 12.9". It's currently the latest & greatest iPad[^2]. I use it with the Smart Keyboard Folio.

## Points of Appreciation

### Size & Weight

The 12.9" iPad is basically the same size as a 3-Subject spiral notebook. Call me crazy but I'd consider that "just about perfect" for a multitude of use cases.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3coloaG5h05ujsGqdCo1XlWd9KUkY1fZ5cm1qgRHK2x41WoDjbsjU7B2fDB69_sZRTFZrnsXc4f-y9tWt0pX3O9P25EewCC7eajrxAH1dGeugyMpwQLczMz0mmfii-Q8QOyrvSVDJWGsT1DMCWXbnnXDw=w800](assets/407-1.jpg)

Some may opt for the smaller 11 inch iPad, which would be much more comfortable to use with one hand. That's perfectly fine. I almost never hold my iPad while I use it. I'm very happy to have the extra screen real-estate.

### System-Wide Integrations

The iPad plays so nicely with my iPhone, and with itself. I'm a sucker for little things like a keyboard shortcut to bring up the Spotlight search (Commands + Space bar, for the record). I never feel like I'm more than 3 seconds away from *anything else* I want to do... because I'm not. I can fly through the interface using any of the MANY input methods available. 

In addition to all of that, Apple's built in "Shortcuts" app is awesome. I do almost all of my "life tracking" inputs using Shortcuts now. The possibilities within that ecosystem are so incredibly vast. I could write multiple blog posts about how cool shortcuts are and what you can do with them. Maybe another day.

### Multimedia Consumption Capabilities

This one seems obvious, but you've gotta say it. The iPad is a **stellar** multimedia consumption device. It is more powerful than my Nintendo Switch. It's big enough to watch movies, but small enough to function like a Kindle device. Its battery is good for multiple hours of continuous usage. Its screen refreshes at 120hz and the power of the device ensures that your animations get the *benefit* of all 120 of those refreshes each second. Even something as stupid simple as "scrolling" feels so much better on the iPad than anything else I've ever used. It's incredible.

The App Store is full of apps that take full advantage of the device. There are games, like *legitimate* games that can rival the likes of dedicated gaming consoles. There is an app for every streaming service in existence. A tablet + noise-canceling headphones is the ultimate way to watch a movie (outside of a theater), so far as I'm concerned.

### Multimedia Creation Capabilities

The iPad has slowly become more and more capable of replacing "Pro" apps people have always relied on computers for.

GarageBand is an underrated, under-appreciated app. Sure, it enables any idiot like me to crank out garbage, but it also can be used to quickly record, mix, and play around with new ideas. I'm 100% sure that there are legitimate musicians out there who got started just messing around with GarageBand.

I now edit [our podcast](https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co/) using my iPad. The purpose-built app "[Ferrite Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185)" is *faster* than my old solution using a computer, mouse, and keyboard. Also now I know what "Ducking" is. Guy1 was way wrong about it.

There are *dozens* of great photo-editing apps out there. I'm not hugely into photo editing, but if I were - I'd re-touch my photos by *actually touching* my photos.

When it comes to editing videos, there are a number of solid entry-level video editors you can use to stitch together clips, set them to a song, and over-use transitions. Beyond the  entry level stuff there are some very legitimate video editing tools. There are professional YouTubers who make a living producing and editing videos from an iPad using [LumaFusion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008). I have yet to produce any video content since downloading LumaFusion, but that time is coming. From the experience I do have with it thus far, it's actually *better* at showing me a preview that doesn't freeze and stutter.     

Computer-Aided Drafting! This is a new thing I didn't know I could do until a few months back. Yet again the iPad has *good,* dedicated apps for this. Things that were built from the ground-up as an iPad experience. [Shapr3d](https://www.shapr3d.com/) has already helped me turn a few projects into reality.

Drawing with an iPad is better than drawing with a pencil and paper. I'm not an artist's artist, so take this entire opinion with, say, 4.3 grains of salt. But I enjoy the experience of kicking back and making stuff on [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) more than I do with a sketch pad and several pencils/erasers. I haven't yet broken into Vector art, despite trying in earnest for a couple evenings. It seems like it would be way up my alley.

I should also pay lip service to the fact there's 3 cameras + LiDAR on this thing. Scanning rooms with [Polycam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-lidar-3d-scanner/id1532482376) is cool - as is the built-in "Measure" app. All of these things come in handy from time to time, but still don't be the person taking pictures at the park with an iPad.

## School & Work

One thing I **don't** have a ton of experience with is *working* on an iPad. I can't use it for my job. I am not actively in school, so I don't have the benefit of that experience either... but if I *could* use it for my job and/or I *was* in school, this device would be glued to my side even more than it already is. I've written about [Notetaking Platform Anxiety]({{siteurl}}/258) (which I've mostly gotten over at this point thanks to Notion + Lastpass), but there's more possibilities with [GoodNotes 5](https://www.goodnotes.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), and even the built-in "Notes" app than I ever *dreamed* of back when I was obsessing over this years ago.

I do not have Microsoft Office installed on my iPad. I have almost zero use for Microsoft Office product in my personal life. Google Docs does just fine. I've never tried to use the build-in Office applications on the iPad. I'm sure they're fine, but I've never had a reason to use them.

## Communication & Coding

The iPad is an adept communications device, and technically capable of producing software. You have full access to iMessages, Facetime, email, and any sort of other app-based communications platform you so choose.

Coding from an iPad is possible, but still usually a limited experience full of workarounds. That said, apps like [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) can take you pretty far. Also there are plenty of text editors available and methods to interface with Git repos and/or SSH targets. I have full and working access to [Glitch.com](http://glitch.com), which is how I'm building all my hobbiest stuff right now. I'm planning to *try* to use the iPad for creating the Raspberry Pi-based "Personal Data Warehouse", once I get the Glitch-based version to a point where I'm happy with it. 

I heavily look forward to a day where I can use VS Code on the iPad. Maybe with the advent of Apple Silicon, that will happen someday soon. 

## Things that Could be Better

For everything that's great about the iPad, there is room for obvious improvement in certain regards. 

### Bugs

Although I'm impressed by iPadOS as a whole, there are some seams that could be ironed out. I can reproduce numerous bugs & undesirable behaviors.

1. The software keyboard often unnecessarily displays when I first flip it into the smart folio typing mode. 
2. Bottom menus in slide-over mode are obfuscated by the keyboard soft keys.

![Bug](assets/407-2.png)

3. I've seen several cases where the "roundedness" of the corners on various software elements changes slightly during animations. These are the nittiest of nitpicks.

### Second Display

The whole iPad is meant to be used as a standalone device. The fact that I CAN plug it into an external display is basically an afterthought for most apps. A select FEW apps can take good advantage of a second display - but most just duplicate the iPad display... aspect ratio and all. This is a more legitimate gripe.

This is just about useless.

![big black bars image](assets/407-3.jpg)

These are nice, but very specific to a given use case. 

![keynote](assets/407-4.jpg)

![lumafusion](assets/407-5.jpg)

## Convergence of MacOS & iPadOS

In an ideal world, the iPad would look feel and function exactly like it does already... up until you plugged into an external display. At which point it would essentially switch to a Mac Mini. Now that Apple is producing the M1 chip for their desktop OS, I think this is not out of the realm of possibility. I love iPadOS and the windowing limitations built in make for a much simpler, more elegant experience in the tablet environment... but when it's connected to a keyboard & mouse & external display, if it flipped over to full-Mac mode, it would become literally the only device you need in any context. 

# You Get an iPad! You Get an iPad!

This is an absolutely worthless daydream; but the other day I was thinking about "what would happen if every citizen of a country were just... given an iPad?" If we *knew* that everyone had access to this type of a device (and internet was a guaranteed thing, like it *should* be), we could reshape some of the more tedious parts of societal living. We could have a common set of apps & functions for things like - sharing medical information, doing your taxes, attending school, interfacing with the library system. If *everyone* had one, there would be little incentive for them to be stolen. Meanwhile we'd have a culture full of people who have access to this incredible tool for learning, communicating, creating, and consuming.

I also realize I'm just setting up an episode of "Black Mirror" and there are so many things that could go horribly wrong.

# Non-iPad Stuff

Lately I've not been writing on here too much. Instead I've been going hard in the paint.

## Schema Change

For anyone obsessively checking my Creation Of The Week *(read: nobody)* this comes as no surprise - I've been hard at work theorizing and writing code. That's taken up 90% of my non-family-oriented available time over the past couple months. I finally hit a few milestones.

In the transition between "The Life Tracker" and my "Personal Data Warehouse" I added some additional layers of complexity to enable some neat stuff and solve a lot of problems I have lived with for nearly a decade.

What I did was introduce the concept of "scope". I have written in the past about my desire to find a solution for tracking things that happen every day, along side things that only happen once a week and stuff that could happen hundreds of times a day. This increases the complexity of the system tremendously. 

When looking at a data table (or spreadsheet, if you like), it's important to know what delineates the records (or rows) from each other. In data science terms, this is called the "key" of the table. Before, the key of The Life Tracker was pretty easy to define. Each row was separated from the others by the "date" field. This can no longer be true, though, if I hit a button that adds a row every time I take some ibuprofen. Suddenly my key field becomes key field**s**, which makes things more complicated. I wound up breaking the whole thing into multiple tables, which really I'd *sort of* done in the past with Life Tracker v3 through v7. This time it's just not spreadsheet-based.

There is literally an entire discipline of study regarding the best way to organize databases to optimize them for various purposes. This experience has already taught me a lot of neat stuff, and I've still got a long way to go.

## Garage Sale

Also were looking to downsize the stuff we own. This is also not a single-day exercise. Melissa has been doing 95% of the lifting, but man that remaining 5% is **tough**.

# Top 5: Most-Loved Devices I've Owned


This is me looking back with rose-colored glasses, somewhat. But also a reflection of my day-to-day fondness for using each device in question.

## 5. The Nintendo Switch
 
My Nintendo Switch doesn't get the attention I wish I could give it. I really like the concept of the device. Video games don't need to be 4k120fps to be enjoyable. What they have to be is fun and inventive, and that's what the Nintendo Switch was all about. The fact that it's both a TV Console and a handheld gaming system is such a great design. It's only hurt by the fact that my hands do NOT work with the joycons, which makes it much less viable as a "play anywhere" device for me. Regardless, two of my favorite games of all time are Switch games (Breath of the Wild & Hollow Knight). 

## 4. My Desktop PC

My current desktop PC is the best, most powerful PC I've ever owned *(note: it's not powerful by today's standards)*. I built it around being a moderately capable gaming machine at the time. I used it as a gaming rig for several years. Although it's role has devolved to basically JUST being my device for doing serious coding, it's still been great to me for 5+ years now. 

## 3. The Nexus 5
 
The Nexus 5 was a great phone. It's my favorite phone I've ever owned. It was the high point of the confluence of feature set, usability, and affordability. The Nexus 6P & the OG Droid are both close on their tail. No iPhone has ever gotten me as excited as any of those 3 devices did. It's too bad Android phones fell off a cliff of botched mimicry and muddled completely rudderless design.

## 2. The Nexus 7 (original)

The original Nexus 7 was a 7-inch pure Android tablet released by Google in 2012 for the ridiculously good price of $199. It was an awesome size. Just big enough to feel more substantial than a phone, but small enough to fit anywhere. It was light, but felt "rugged". It was a device that was completely built around being a good "consumption" device. It didn't bother having a back-facing camera. It didn't try to be a "work" device. That made it much better at what it *was* supposed to be. When you bought it, you were credited with some Google Play money to make good use of it. 

## 1. The [iPad Pro 12.9" (4th Generation)](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/)

The device this Column was written about (and on).

> **Alexa, play 'matching pitch'**
<cite>My 2 year old asking Alexa to play the song we sing when we have him match pitch</cite>

[^1]: The use of the term "love" to describe in inanimate object is a bit tricky for me. I love my wife. I love my kids. I'd throw this iPad into the blades of a helicopter before letting my kid get hurt. Love of objects is a different feeling altogether. Terms are allowed to have different, but vaguely related meanings. It's called "[semantic overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_overload)".

[^2]: Rumors (and common sense) strongly suggest that this iPad will become *not* the latest & greatest in the near future. And that's okay.

# Motto: Whatever I feel like. That's the whole idea.

It's been a little while since I updated. My mind has been on other things.

A while back my cousin had me watch a few episodes of Community. I liked it. I told Melissa that I liked it and that she should watch some episodes. Because she's great, she started watching it. She likes it. Because she likes it, I decided to start watching it.

It almost sounds like that violates causality... but I think if you follow along with my visual aid you'll figure out that natural order has been retained:

![](assets/67-1.jpg)

Not pictured: The explanation behind Looper.

Community is great. It's quickly escalated to become one of my favorite shows on TV with some of my favorite character/actor combinations I've ever seen. It's great.

Here's a fun fact not everyone knows about me already: I briefly tried to be a cartoonist for the newspaper at the University of Kansas. You see, their comics were terrible. So terrible that I thought - hey, my doodles are equally terrible! Maybe my doodles could be terrible in the paper!

Here's an example of a terrible cartoon - it's called "Chicken Nuggets":

![](assets/67-2.jpg)

Drawn in 2 minutes off a horrible premise... obviously

I want to start putting more drawings in here. I like them. The one above is laughably terrible, but that's okay. It gets the point across.

I spent the weekend hanging out with Melissa's family. Note - she is still in Thailand. I was spending time with them, not her and them. I have to say, much like went I went to visit her sister a week or two ago, I expected it to go well and it exceeded my expectations. In short: Great.

I'm going to keep this super short and sweet. The Top 5 and Quote are unrelated to anything. In order to get in my movie/tv show/music/book reference I'll just say it this way:

And now, for something completely different!

# Top 5: Things bullets do in the movies that they don't do in real life
5. Neatly override all door-locking mechanisms (e.g padlocks or metal chains)
4. Curve around bodies based on how you shoot them (e.g. all of WANTED)
3. Magically never run out (e.g. most action movies)
2. Light things on fire (e.g. gasoline spilled on concrete)
1. Cause most things to explode (e.g. a car's gas tank)

# Motto: Facts are Overrated Anyway

For over a week I've had two Feature Posts half-written. One of them is about intelligence, the other is about tools. Today's post was written for one, then transferred to the other, then I decided it was long enough to warrant a feature post of its own. So, without further ado...

Technology is amazing and nobody appreciates it enough.

Every system in the world runs in the same way: a source of high potential energy runs through an extremely complex path of least resistance on its way to a place of lower potential energy. In engineering this path, humans have figured out how to make everyone into quasi-superheroes. We can see what our friends saw a year ago. We can hear them speak from across the country. We can access an awe-inspiring network of answers and functions known as the internet.

Right now my earphones are getting power from my phone, which is getting power from my computer, which is getting power from my wall, which is getting power from the grid, which is getting power from some unseen turbine(s) miles away from here. The turbine is spinning a set of conductive coils about very powerful magnets thanks to pressure caused by heat generated by way of nuclear fission, burning fossil fuels, or some form of green energy.

I am on a phone call with my colleague from California. I consider him a friend as well, so I'll call him that.

My friend is talking ~1500 miles away and I can hear him. How?

The changes in air pressure caused my my friend's mouth and vocal chords push a tiny magnet on a tiny membrane through a tiny loop of copper. This induces a current on the copper using the exact same principle the power plant relies on to generate electricity (just in reverse). This tiny current is amplified and digitized (turned in to a long series of 0's and 1's) by the electrical current running from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of my friend's phone's battery. This digital (binary) signal is driven into a tiny antenna within the handset where it radiates out into the air. This newly created electric field crosses through the atmosphere until it reaches the antennas of one (or more) cellular base stations. The electric fields at these antennas induce an electrical potential differential (voltage) into the circuitry of the radio tower. The base station then converts the voltages on this copper circuitry into light pulses, which it beams down a pair of concentric tubes of glass. Miles later, these light pulses are converted back into a traditional electrical signal that feeds into an extremely complex network of networks orchestrated by my friend's cellular provider and the public phone system. That network of networks forwards the signal along an incredibly intricate and long path of least resistance that ends at the antennas of the cell tower(s) nearest me. The signal is broadcast into the air (along with thousands of others) where it hits the tiny antennas inside my phone. The current going from the positive terminal of my phone's battery to its negative terminal demodulates and deconstructs the signal from the antenna, pulls out the portion that was meant for me, turns it into an analog signal, then sends it down the wire to my earbuds. A tiny magnet inside my earbuds reacts to the incoming signal by vibrating a tiny membrane back and forth, changing the air pressure inside my ear. And I can hear what my friend is saying.

The whole thing is driven by the splitting of Uranium 235 and/or coal burning and/or natural gas burning and/or some form of green energy. It transverse thousands of miles, and it happens in less than a second.

And that's amazing.

That's why I studied engineering.

And you all need to appreciate it more.

The picture to go out on - every time you see one of these, try to remember this post and APPRECIATE what you can do:

![cell tower](assets/94-1.jpg)

# Top 5: Other Things to Consider
5. The capacitive capacity of my fingers is detected by my phone's touchscreen. My phone is detecting and reacting to something I didn't even know existed until my teenage years.
4. I just used the phrase "capacitive capacity"; and it actually made sense. I'm proud of that. I could and probably will at some point write about simultaneously self-actualizing in art and engineering.
3. Everything we've built started in the nature. We found all this stuff in the ground and machined it into something useful.
2. People used to physically open and close a circuit to send messages. It was called a telegraph. 
1. If you abstract the process a little, the system starts in my friend's brain. It drives an even more impressive natural network to make his mouth and vocal chords create specific air pressure changes. Miles away, my ears pick them up, convert them to electrical signals of their own, then feed them into my brain which converts them into meaning. The system directly connects my brain to that of Kyle in California. Whoa.

Motto: Tangent

  
Systems analysis - that's got to be a passtime of mine. I like taking apart different systems to learn about how they work. Taking apart machines to see how they run. Analyzing workflows to find inefficiencies. Looking at a set of logical processes to and finding ways to reduce their complexity. I like all of these things. So, for a long time I've wished I had some sort of example or set of examples for "how to live a successful and happy life: an up to date guide". It's this fundamental desire that drove me to obsess over note-taking systems, do a several-week-long time analysis project, build a Aaron's Life Reference guide, and create the Life Tracker 1.0 & 2.0... but think about how much easier this would have all been with some examples! I'm talking about something like a series of tutorials & how-tos. A reference guide to everything from "making, keeping, and tracking a budget" to "how to exercise effectively and efficiently" to "how to manage projects". Sometime I should write down my methodologies for the use of individuals who have felt similar struggles. These reference guides would use everything I do as example. "Okay folks, here's how I manage XYZ". So often, you don't know what you don't know. Now that I've pushed through several years of successfully managing "adult life", maybe I'm worthy of writing this how-to. Then again, I've got zero kids. No house. I've got an awfully long way to go before I could really package up "Life: The Reference Guide". Whatever. **Here's what it would look like:** Page 1: Introduction Good things are good. Bad things are bad. Good things are better than bad things. You should maximize the number of good things in your life and minimize the number of bad things. This will make you happy. Happiness is good. Here's a list of other good things... Life Play Physical Fitness Resource management Time management Money management Music Cleanliness ... Page 50: (still on the list of good things) ... clear sinus passages Spatial awareness Sanity Active listening practices Concise speech Carrots Respect Simple machines ... Page 77: (end of list of good things and beginning of section 1) ... Appropriate volume levels Education Pullups (the exercise, not the diapers) Fishing and Four leaf clovers Section 1: the Fundamentals  
So, that list of good things was good (note to self: add "list of good things" to the list), but where should I START? Let's take a look at Maslow's hierarchy of human needs and answer that question... If you want more, buy the book. It comes out in the year 2035\.

Motto: Read It

  
When it comes to my New Year's resolution, August was known as "the Month of Many Challenges". Here's a brief summary of the results for the five things I set out to do last month: Track Spending - I fixed the broken part of the Life Tracker. I kept very accurate records of spending during my normal routine, but as soon as "extraordinary circumstances" came into play I quickly went back to NOT tracking my spend. I managed to track 3 1/2 weeks pretty successfully, but this was probably a failure overall. Buy another car - I didn't buy another car. The flat tire was a forced expense. My parents lent us a car. We are still going to buy one soon, but I failed on this one. "Less Projects" - this wasn't really a clearly defined goal. I didn't even know what I meant when I wrote it. There was a semi-sorta-obvious-epiphany I had a couple days ago, but I don't really think I can count this as "success". New workout routine - My new routine has 3 days at the gym and one day outside of the gym. I didn't manage to do all four workouts in a week even once. I did 3 workouts every week up until last week, in which I did exactly 1... and that's IF you count beach volleyball as "cardio". The workout routine I like. Otherwise, I failed. I just continue to struggle going to the gym as much as I wish I did (welcome to the world, that's everyone's problem). No Reddit - This one sucked. I wanted to see if I would find a way to utilize my "time wasted" more effectively. All it really did was PREVENT me from utilizing my "time wasted" in ANY effective manner. I tried going to news sites. It didn't work. I ended up just playing a lot more phone games. At least Reddit is entertaining. I'm glad this one is over. I DID NOT FAIL! Although I wish I would have. In short, the results: **20% success!** The most frustrating 20% possible! So. This is a new month. I think I'm only going to do ONE challenge. **September's Challenge:**Will be announced at the end of September. I'm doing one, though. On a different topic: I recently came up with a new medium-to-long-term project idea. I want to create a supermegaultracut of all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe according to the chronology of their shared timeline. That is to say, I'm going to put the scenes from Thor that were supposed to take place thousands of years ago first. Then Captain America will happen. Then there will be some bits from the Winter Soldier. Then Iron Man 1\. Then Iron Man 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk all happening at the same time. I'd like to do this AFTER Guardians of the Galaxy comes out on blu-ray but BEFORE The Avengers: Age of Ultron comes out in theater. In the meantime, I have to lookup copyright laws and figure out what exactly I'm allowed to do. I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to make this supercut, but can anyone other than me watch it? I want to go about this by the books.  
  
Tonight was the Fantasy Football draft. I did a Google (video) Hangout with my cousins. My wife spectated for a large portion of it. I had a good time. I had no idea what I was doing for the majority of it, but I think by this time next year I'll be a champion. I changed my team name from "Archimedes Garfunkel" to "Success Kid" when I realized that each team is supposed to have an associated picture.   
I have several Columns lined up. Two feature posts. A Column #200 celebration. These might come out in rapid succession. They might not.. Melissa and I got some camping stuff. This Column is already long enough so I'll just show you:

Motto: The words need to fit together. The paragraphs do not.

  
Writing.

  
Every time I start a Column it starts with the single word "Writing". I go in and change it to say other stuff usually, but today I felt like leaving it. No further words need to be said about that.

  
If I stuck were in a room with nothing but a window. I wonder how much time would have to pass before I noticed time wasn't passing.

  
Whoever said variety is the spice of life was a smart dude. He probably also just got out of a rut of some sort. 

  
My Roomba plays a little fanfare when it's done cleaning and successfully returns back to its base station to rejuice. You can hear it in [the first 8 seconds of this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkTVAd%5FYYc4). I haven't thought much about tune before - but today when it was finished I instinctively said "chaaarge!". Only after I said that out loud, did I realize some product designer has a sense of humor. iRobot must hire dads. Pretty good.

  
Spiderman: Homecoming was great. I don't want to leave a review yet, cause I've only seen it once. It's worth the rewatch. A review may or may not come later. On a tangential note: THAT is how you make a movie that's part of a greater universe. You don't show a guy opening some emails, or a bunch of costumes in a basement. This is a perfect franchise movie.

  
The past 6 weeks my sleep has been nosediving.

8:28  
7:37  
7:25  
6:54  
6:23  
5:39  

Those are the actual measurements, in order, of the average duration of my past 6 weeks. I have no idea what's going on. I've slept almost 3 hours PER NIGHT less this week than I did a month and a half ago.

  
This weekend was great. 

  
Golf is a fun, if frustrating game.  
  
**Reasons I like bars:**  
\- ostensibly, they facilitate meeting new people  
\- their lighting is usually a bit dim, which is how I like rooms to be  
**Reasons I dislike bars:**  
\- the people I meet at bars are not generally people I want to meet  
\- the types of conversations I like having are not possible in that environment  
\- the types of conversations I hate having happen way too often  
\- the conversations that are held, are usually held at a volume I cannot discern from the crazy loud ambient noise  
\- the expected behavior of people at bars is not in any way in line with how I like behaving  
\- the atmosphere usually ranges from mildly aggressive to outright threatening  
\- the concept of personal space is foreign  
\- desperate people scream for attention  
\- the food is some combination of bad, bad for you, and expensive  
\- the drinks are more expensive than the kind you'd bring to a friend's house  
\- the sanitation is usually minimal at best, if the place isn't outright gross  
\- there's always some guy who will come try to join my group to hit on all the girls in it, even the one I'm married to  
  
Given the choice between going to a friend's house or going to a bar, I'll chose the friend's house 100 times out of 100.  
  
Next up: The Defenders.  
  
Humidity and wind chill are a thing because we are a warm-blooded animal. There is a constant thermodynamic back-and-forth between us and the pocket of air around us. If that pocket of air has a ton of water in it, it becomes harder to cool off, thus it feels hotter. If that pocket if air is replaced with _new_ air, it feels cooler. That's kind of neat to think about.  
  
Here's a picture of me from today:

Motto: Writing for Me, by Me

  
Melissa is going back to grad school, she's taking her Mac Air & iPad with her & utilizing Microsoft OneNote. While she was setting up her notetaking environment, I started thinking about how I would architect my "idealized system for handling graduate school". Fair warning, this is a bit of an epic.  
  
A system for succeeding in higher education is defined in several broad categories:

1. **What would I physically bring with me to class?**
2. **How would I take notes that are relevant immediately and in the future?**
3. **How do I manage time & tasks?**

Answering these questions is the purpose of this Column. I'm going to do so both "in general" and given my specific (more interesting to me, but less interesting in general) case.

  
**1\. What would I physically bring with me to class?**

Obviously I would bring with me a bag. I'd probably just keep my current messenger bag for simplicity sake. Anything could work.

  
In all cases I can imagine, you'd need a electronic device, be it for accessing the internet for email, looking at course content, performing homework, and/or taking notes. Exactly _which_ electronic device you should bring is a difficult question. You've got tons of options, but they all pretty well fall into the laptop category, the tablet category, or somewhere in between. Which one is right for you?

  
If your notes are mostly text-based, a regular old laptop is perfect. If your notes are heavily graphical, you'll probably want a tablet. If you need both, it's best to get something that handles both use cases reasonably well. Text-based notes with graphical elements can be achieved on tablets (with an associated physical keyboard) or on laptops with touch screens. I prefer the tablet with keyboard method, as drawing something with your pointer finger on a screen held up by a hinge just isn't that great of an experience.

  
When it comes to tablets, most people probably use the de facto iPad as their go-to. If not that, I suspect you'd see a lot of iPad Minis. Less often, you may find an Android tablet or a Microsoft-based tablet (such as their Surface Pro).

  
I think my _ideal_ electronic companion for school (or work while travelling) would be a tablet with a detachable keyboard, sized at about 12 inches. The dimensions should be roughly the same as a typical spiral-bound notebook. I checked, my Chromebook is the right depth, but about 1.5 inches too wide. I wish it were narrower... and the screen came off... and it were touch screen. Maybe something like the [Nexus 9 + Folio Case](http://www.amazon.com/HTC-Nexus-9-Keyboard-Folio/dp/B00MNOQ96A/) would be the right fit for me, maybe not.

  
If you aren't taking notes digitally, you'll probably want a notebook with some writing utensils. I prefer at least three pens of varying colors. I find color to be a helpful added dimension in notetaking. 

  
Bring that stuff, any specialty items you are required to have for classes requiring them, and your normal EDC. If your normal EDC has a gun in it, consider _not_ bring that.

  
Personally - I _may_ be travelling to my eventual university... or I might try some of the newer & innovative online graduate degrees. Computer Science is a particularly good field for such a program. Amongst the schools I'm considering is at least one program that utilizes online classes. So I might not end up even bringing _pants_ with me to school. Time will tell.

  
**2\. How would I take notes that are relevant immediately and in the future?**

In terms of dead-horse topics, my wife will tell you that this one is in contention for the heavyweight champion belt. This is (probably) the deadest of the horses I routinely beat.

  
[Electronic notetaking paradise, the never ending search](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/search?q=notetaking).

  
Before I get started, I should give old-fashioned "paper notebook" notetaking some credit. It's what I've done literally my entire academic life. Each class has a notebook, each notebook is filled with pages of notes, doodles, and non-sequiturs. The problem, though, is that those notes don't remain relevant in the future. I have written more notes than I ever care to go through, but if I ever wanted to find one thing from them - that's exactly what I'd have to do. Pull out each notebook from the shelf I never access and look through them page by page. Physical notetaking just doesn't appeal to me as a "compendium of knowledge" sort of thing. While I do admit it's probably better for digesting the information (writing is better than typing for translating text into actual learning), it is not a viable resource for rediscovery or long-term consumption.

  
Also before I continue into my short rant about the sad state of notetaking software, let me take another aside - the column was originally going to be about just this next point.

  
"The Cloud" vs. Local Resources - as written in my Moleskine

_The Google fanatic in me wants to use web services for everything. I picture a Utopian life in the cloud, where all my content and tools are ubiquitously and immediately available on any device with a web connection. Configuration and system maintenance are never really needed. You fire up your computer, phone, chromebook, or whatever & pick up right where you left off._  
_The old-fashioned computer geek in me wants to build out "the" system. A single machine on which you can run anything you install and you're nest is built just right. You carved your own empire out of the stone, every decision deliberate and all details put to your desire. When you are in your chair, at your battlestation, you are limitless with what you can accomplish. Your CPU is more than enough engine to take you anywhere you want to go, and you're the engineer._  
_...but your computer could crash, your OS could corrupt, you could get a virus, it could get stolen or destroyed. No matter what, you're eventually going to upgrade to something else. Also, what about those times where you want to do work, but aren't at your desk? What about when you're out and about and you need access to your documents? Your tricked-out computational kingdom is great - but it's a single resource at a single location and serves a single point of failure._  
_On the other hand, is "the cloud" really all that great? You can't really (yet) do any serious video editing, photo or music production, or development. Sure, having your toolkit with you at all times is great - but is that worth shrinking your set of tools? Also, what tools you do have are subject to change without notification, consent, or your control. You may put all of your eggs in one, beautiful basket just to find someday that your basket has changed into something you didn't like - or worse yet - it's not even in the tree of "supported products" by whatever 3rd party owns it. Who's to say their company and their service has any longer lifespan than your own computer? People who put tons of work & time into Google Reader might warn you not to get too invested in a product you can't prevent from destruction._  
_The Cloud and Local Resources share similar-yet-opposite advantages and disadvantages:_  
_**"The Cloud"**_  
_Advantages:_  
_\> Ubiquitous access_  
_\> Hardware failure isn't likely to kill your projects & content_  
_\> Generally gets better & faster over time_   
_Disadvantages:_  
_\> You need an internet connection_  
_\> What services you use may die on you_  
_\> Security threat: Hackers_  
_**Local Resources**_  
_Advantages:_  
_\> Permanent access, so long as your computer runs it won't go away_  
_\> Total control_  
_\> Powerful applications - video, photo, code, & music production_  
_Disadvantages:_  
_\> You need to be at your computer_  
_\> What hardware you use may die on you_  
_\> Security threat: Viruses_

  
You can see how that was originally going to be its own Column. But why write more than one ultra-long piece about this something so similar in theme?  
  
So - why bring that up at all?  
  
The ultimate conclusion from the Moleskine entry is that you just have to decide whether you're going to use web services or a local program to accomplish tasks on a case-by-case basis. Some cases are simple: who wants a local email client anymore? Video editing is clearly something that works better locally. Notetaking, though, is kind of in an in-between state. You want access to your notes everywhere, but you'll also want the horsepower and staying power of a local client. You want your notes to be permanent - so that makes cloud solutions less appealing (two separate cloud-based notetaking platforms I've used in the past are no longer a thing - I'm very glad I never put much stock in either). You _also_ want your notes to be available when you need them - i.e. _on your phone_.  
  
There are essentially two "serious" notetaking solutions available right now: [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) and [Evernote's namesake product](https://evernote.com/). There are other ways to skin a cat, though. You could just have a folder on your computer with tons of text documents, or word documents. You could back up that folder in Dropbox or Google Drive. Google Drive has the added benefit of including a native document/spreadsheet editor that's surprisingly capable. All in all, it boils down to three real ways to do stuff... and each is imperfect. I have refined/expanded my list of "required features" in recent years. Here's an updated version of the table from [Column #166](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/04/166-attack-mode.html):  
  
[![](assets/258-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Xap5zCCWs0/Vd0z2fGp-sI/AAAAAAAB7Y8/Hkr6Eu%5FuUa4/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-08-25%2Bat%2B10.33.57%2BPM.png)

  
\* - although it hardly counts  
\*\* - if you pay for it  
\*\*\* - if you use Outlook, so this shouldn't be here at all, really  
  
All of the listed solutions technically let you store notes locally & on the cloud, but OneNote is more locally focused, Evernote is more cloud focused, and Drive is both and neither.  
  
Given the current state of affairs, I think the best overall product for notetaking is Microsoft OneNote... but I don't use it in my personal life because Microsoft wants you to use your OneDrive & Outlook.com email account, neither of which I have any interest in. If it were just slightly better, I'd suck it up and make a new "outlook" account, or whatever they are calling it nowadays. I use Google Drive plus LastPass to cover the password-protected usage case (which is critical for my needs).

  
Realistically - I'd guess the _best_ way to take digital notes right now is to use something like the [Microsoft Surface Pro 3 + OneNote](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Intel-Core-Windows/dp/B00KHR4T8U)... but I'm certainly not going to put that much money into the Microsoft ecosystem right now. There is a serious void in the market for a truly _great_ system for this. Something customizable, extensible, ubiquitous, that doesn't have a stupid user interface (LOOKING AT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM).  
  
As for _my_ specific case - I'm wanting to taken Computer Science notes. Something you may not know if you've got no experience in programming is that code editors have "syntax highlighting", which basically just changes the color of your text based of what that text _means_ in your code. I'd like to preserve syntax highlighting into my notes. I still haven't really figured out "the" solution for this yet. I'm looking at OneNote again, but may just default back to Google Drive.

  
**3\. How do I manage time & tasks?**

  
This question has been the subject of [tons of research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22time+management%22&btnG=&hl=en&as%5Fsdt=0%2C5) and [thousands of books](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-Business-Life-Books/b?ie=UTF8&node=2569). I'm certainly not an expert, but I did technically succeed in my education and work life thus far, so I guess that gives me some credibility.  

I've used versions of the "[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting%5FThings%5FDone)" method in the past, with varying levels of success... but really I've found that most of the time I can just make lists of tasks and their associated due dates. My life hasn't been so ridiculously helplessly overwhelmed with "to-dos" that a true GTD method was warranted.  
  
The best way to do stuff is just to _do it_. Focus on one task at a time. Take time between tasks to look back at your master task list to ensure you aren't missing focus on something that warrants it. I like to make physical lists for each _day_, and a master digital list for things in the future. That gives me the satisfaction of physically crossing things off and it pits my tasks against my calendar, which is necessary.  
  
Whatever your preferred task & time management solution is - it needs to be paired with structure and discipline to have a chance of success. Right now, I'm breaking my own structure because I'm not disciplined enough to stick to my current 30 Day Challenge's "in bed by 10" rule.  
  
**In conclusion:**  
I really want to go into graduate school with a well-thought out system for doing things. Something built with the experience of high school and my undergrad degree. I don't know what platform I'm going to use for my notes, I don't even know what physical medium I'll be using. I don't want to buy into something and then switch midway through, so I'm suffering from platform anxiety. I should probably be focusing my effort more on _which_ grad program I'll be doing & when, but that's not as fun to think about.  
  
This is perhaps the longest Column I've written. I wish it ended with a strong "AND THIS IS HOW I'LL SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS" section, but it didn't end like that. It ended like this.

  
Top 5: Things I Wish Would Happen

5\. Google would merge Chrome OS and Android  
4\. The newly merged super OS would come with a new hybrid/convertible computer, roughly the same size as a spiral notebook  
3\. The new hybrid/convertible computer would include a focus area on notetaking and personal productivity  
2\. To highlight that focus, Google announces the return of Google Notebooks that checks every box in my table  
1\. Someone would give me a back rub. This was an all-night type post. If you read it, I'm both flattered and confused.

Motto: **careful with these links, they go to TVTropes.com - which you'll never leave**  

  
I have seen some pretty good movies lately (see the Top 5 for more on that), but today's post is wholly dedicated to a rant about one, truly bad movie. I'm using some resources to help here. [TVTropes.com](http://tvtropes.com/) and [the top review on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/reviews?ref%5F=tt%5Furv) are the two main ones.  
  
The worst movie I have ever seen is the 2005 Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan.   
  
[![](assets/249-1.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d3P1pKEEhcA/VZa%5FmwHQ3aI/AAAAAAAB3fQ/yI38Zi-g6TQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-07-03%2Bat%2B11.59.15%2BAM.png)

  
If you haven't seen it & don't care to hear my opinion or have seen it & liked it, this post isn't for you. If you saw it & hated it or you haven't seen it, but are curious how I could hate a movie enough to write this much about it, read on.  
  
There will be spoilers... but I'm not spoiling anything _good_, so I don't think it counts.   
  
Rather than me explaning the premise, you should just watch this minute-and-a-half trailer:  
  
  
Okay, so what have we got? An intelligently written thriller, right?  
  
Wrong.  
  
The main reason I hate Flightplan beyond any other terrible movie is that this movie isn't obviously terrible going in. In retrospect there are a couple of red flags in that trailer, but it's not oozing terribleness. I have seen Scary Movie 2-4, Epic Movie, Starship Troopers 2, Grown Ups, Paul Blart, and several other terrible movies... but I didn't expect anything from them. When those movies delivered nothing, I was okay with that.   
  
Flightplan is different. It has a big name actress, an genuinely interesting premise, a large-ish budget, decent production value, and a somewhat engaging first act. The movie starts to take a dump when you meet the Air Marshall. The script would like you to believe he's a righteous cop, so that it can really surprise you when it later reveals he was the bad guy all along! The problem is, they picked an actor who plainly _looks_ like he's the villain. So the movie instantly becomes a waiting game until the big "reveal" later on. To add insult to injury, they use a couple of Middle Eastern guys as a [red-herring](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring), because, you know, 9/11.  
  
When the movie does get around to the shocking revelation that the clearly evil guy is in fact evil, you also find out his evil plan to get $50 million. Allow me to outline some of the points upon which this master plan is completely dependent.  
  
1\. You find an American aeronautics engineer with a family (including a spouse and a child) working in a foreign country, with encyclopedic knowledge of a certain long-haul plane.  
2\. You can kill the spouse of said engineer in such a way that she will not become a suspect.  
3\. The dead spouse goes to a hospital with a mortuary whose susceptible to bribery.  
4\. The engineer decides NOT to cremate her spouse or have him buried there.  
5\. The engineer decides to fly her spouse's coffin back to America.  
6\. The engineer decides to fly on the same plane as her spouse's coffin, and to bring her child along.  
7\. That plane just so happens to be the exact plan the engineer helped design.  
8\. Your flight-attendant evil assistant and you (as the air marshal) can work this same flight.  
9\. Coffins aren't scanned for bombs? Is this a thing? Are you serious? So you put some bombs in that coffin, which is then locked and only the engineer knows the combination.  
10\. The engineer and her kid get on the plane first.  
11\. The engineer and her kid sit way back in the back of the plane.  
12\. There is nobody else around these two on the inaugural flight of this new type of aircraft.  
13\. **This is critical - nobody sees the engineer's kid. So, you hope that she doesn't do anything to draw attention to herself, you know, like talk to anyone at all, make noise, or generally live.**  
14\. The engineer and her kid decide to sleep... but not _just_ sleep, sleep with some distance between them. The kid cannot have the window seat or be cuddling with her mom.  
15\. You can grab the kid without waking her up (or the mom). Also - you can abduct a child without other people in the plane seeing.  
16\. You can somehow delete the records of the kid getting on the plane.  
17\. You can grab the kid's boarding pass from her mom without waking her up.  
18\. You can smuggle this kid from the back of the plane to the front of the plane in a cart without alerting anyone, or waking the kid up.  
19\. You can get the kid into the front part of the plane, through a hatch and down into the nose without the kid waking up. Again - the kid cannot wake up at any point.  
20\. The engineer wakes up early enough in the flight to have enough time after she finds her kid missing to cause a panic in the plane and make everyone hate her. Also, she must go berserk or you won't be able to take control of the situation.  
21\. You can convince the captain that the woman is lying and get him to order you to contain her.  
22\. You can effectively make the woman question her own sanity, enough to cause her to break free to open her husband's casket to see his body and not that of... him and his daughter? In one casket?  
23\. The engineer willingly compromises a plane in-flight to allow herself to go to said casket.  
24\. Upon opening the husband's casket, not immediately finding the explosives.  
25\. That you can capture her immediately, without her re-locking the casket (which, again, only she knows the combination to).  
26\. You can leave the now-well-known threat to the plane alone as you return to the casket, get the explosives, arm them, and place them in the nose compartment next to the still somehow sleeping daughter without waking her up.  
27\. The woman, upon discovering one casket and not two, cannot convince the pilot or anyone else you aren't currently paying off to go check that there is, indeed, no little girl casket.  
28\. After telling the pilot that the engineer is actually a terrorist demanding $50 million, that the pilot will take your word for it and not want to talk to her.  
29\. That the money will actually get paid quick enough (and again, it will actually get paid without anyone talking to the supposed hijacker directly).  
30\. The explosives in the nose of the plane complete obliterate the (still sleeping) child and remove evidence of her ever existing.  
31\. You can kill the engineer/false plane hijacker and still keep the money.  
32\. Nobody involved in your intricate plan decides to talk or messes up.  
33\. Nobody NOT involved in your intricate plan blows your cover by doing something so outlandish as to talk to the attractive blonde lady or her kid.  
34\. (Going back a bit here) That the engineer and her kid don't have any friends or family that that go on the plane with them... or maybe that didn't go with them on the plane, but just knew that the kid wasn't actually dead.  
35\. Getting explosives into the coffin. Knowing which coffin was picked for the husband and then getting access to it to pack in explosives.  
36\. That you can do all this stuff, the kidnapping, the stealing something from a sleeping woman's pocket, the killing of an innocent man, despite looking like an obviously-guilty creepy guy, ALL completely unnoticed by the other apparently blind people on this plane.  
  
There's a TV Trope called the [Gambit ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette)[Roulette](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette). The movie Flightplan is by far and away the most egregious example of a Gambit Roulette I've ever seen in my life. If any one of those 36 things that the antagonist had no real control over DID NOT happen EXACTLY the way they did, his plan wouldn't have worked. It's the equivalent of going to Vegas and putting a dead body on double-zero in hopes of hitting a $50 million jackpot.  
  
Actually, it's worse than that. That implies there's an equally likely chance of landing on any slot. The likelihood of nobody seeing or remembering the child, being able to kidnap the kid silently while remaining unseen, the mom waking up at the right time, the kid never waking up, the kid and mom deciding to get on the plane with the casket, the plane happening to be the exact one she helped design, AND her going crazy enough to make everyone hate her AND enough to have her actually OPEN the casket.... that's just ridiculous.  
  
I think I've made my point.  
  
Before I wrap this up, I should say that I'd be willing to look PAST all of this nonsense if the film had other redeeming qualities. Maybe it had good comic relief? Maybe it had an interesting subplot? Maybe it doesn't take itself deathly serious? Maybe it doesn't hinge entirely on the plane (and movie theater) being full of complete idiots? Flightplan had none of that.  
  
Never before and never since have I been so completely, awesomely, jaw-droppingly, disappointed by a movie.  
  
Flightplan is the worst movie ever.  

  
Top 5: **Movies I've Watched & Enjoyed Lately**  
5\. Chef  
4\. Jurassic World  
3\. Kingsman: The Secret Service  
2\. Mad Max: Fury Road  
1\. Inside Out - truly a great movie

Motto: Sentences that Begin and End with the Same Word are My Favorite Sentences.

  
Before this 30 Day Challenge I wouldn't really have understood the title I used for this Column.

  
Writing an Android App. That's the goal for March. Technically I accomplished that within the first day, within the first hour. Although "Hello World!" isn't much of an app. I've been working through [Udacity's Android Basics nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803). Well, the coursework that one would do to earn said nanodegree. I'm more interested in the knowledge than the resume boost. 

  
Anyway it's been really good! It's aimed at people who have never coded before - so parts of it are definitely too easy... but that means I'm not getting left behind, like I did last time when I tried going straight into the [Android Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). I'm now starting to get comfortable playing around in the IDE, making my phone do stuff I want it to do. It's my goal to write an app that's actually useful by month's end. Even if that use isn't my final goal. Ultimately, I'd like to create some form of the Life Tracker in Android. For now, I'll settle for something to supplement it.

Udacity is one of the coolest things on the internet, by the way. Free education for anyone who wants it. That's alright by me. 

  
Completely shifting gears:

My first world problem for the day - I feel guilty. I feel guilty for shopping smart. 

  
A while back, when I got my first job, I decided I was going to be high-and-mighty & never, ever, shop at Walmart. Radical. I know. This was because I worked at Walmart for a summer. It sucked. I found it degrading, physically demanding, and low-paying. I was lucky, at least I had a light at then end of a tunnel. I was a college student getting a financially lucrative major, with a safety net in the form of my ever-supporting parents in case everything went to hell. Not everyone there was so lucky. I had more coworkers who had no future prospects than those that did. Walmart to me was exploiting its workers and raking in billions.

  
So I started shopping at Target. Amazon.

  
Am I a moron? Are they any better, at all? No. There's a problem with these huge, buy-anything-you-want conglomerate stores. They are cheap. They are ever-present. They are a consistent source of the basic necessities and _they will not be undercut_.

  
I found myself in a bookstore today. I stumbled across the graphic novel "Fight Club 2". Chuck Palahniuk's follow-up to his smash hit "Fight Club". Now, I'm a walking cliche - so I liked Fight Club. I was interested in the sequel so I picked it up off the shelf. It's a graphic novel, so the book was wrapped shut. Not a big deal, I was going to buy it... until I saw the price. $30\. I thought "wow that's a bit steep for a book", so naturally I pulled up the Amazon app on my phone. Amazon has it for $20\. It will be at my house in 2 days.

  
I suck. Not 3 minutes prior I texted Melissa "I just found the coolest store. They sell everything we like." To thank them I've done them zero good. I've given them zero support. They are a specialty store, therefore they cannot afford to make fractions of a penny on things they sell. For that reason, I don't buy stuff from them. When their business dies, it will be the fault of me and people like me. I am the guilty middle class consumer.

  
I was going to write about budgeting and the benefits of not buying crap... but I'm out of time. BYE HAVE FUN SEE YOU LATER.

  
Top 5: Website I Would Pick If I Could Only Go to Five for the Rest of My Life

5\. Google Docs - creating new content.  
4\. Facebook - for communication.  
3\. Google's Search - even if you can't click on the links, you can learn a TON from reading link synopses... also you've got a calculator and the knowledge graph. Most of Google Maps is accessible without actually going there.  
2\. YouTube - Arguably this should take the #1 spot. You'll never run out of entertainment content. You can learn anything you need to learn.  
1\. Wikipedia - the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is essentially just Wikipedia. It's pretty much all you need to know. I put it as #1 because I like it; although YouTube is probably more useful for any in-depth learning. Udacity, the thing I opened this Column with, is built on top of YouTube.

Motto: No hablo Espanol

  
This is going to be a short and sweet Column. Tonight is Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm more excited than you can imagine. I'm going to wear my Captain America shirt and maybe bring my hammer of Thor. The 30 Day Challenge for July was to learn as much Spanish as I could using the app Duolingo. I did an okay job, but slacked off near the end. Melissa did a much better job than me. When I hear her practicing it makes me feel bad about myself. Her sentences are like "I do not own a house because I do not have much money", whereas my sentences are like "The cat drinks milk" (El gato bebe leche, BTW). I'm going to continue on with Duolingo. I want to learn Spanish. I always assumed I'd learn another language at some point. Just like I never assumed I'd ride a rollercoaster...   

[![](assets/189-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4RvIa6PnhHU/U9q5AkKNAnI/AAAAAAABajs/m1UdW37rH5A/s1600/%23189+-+Rollercoaster.jpg)

August is shaping up to be the "Month of Many Challenges". See the Top 5 below. I'm off to go lift weights, get a haircut, and watch a movie about a group of aliens who steal an Infinity Stone.

  
Top 5: 30 Challenges I'm Doing Simultaneously in August

5\. New workout routine. After the fitness baseline I decided to take up a new workout routine that addresses my goals holistically. My old routine was very much a "powerlifter's" routine, which is a shame because I'm not very strong (as evidenced by my 265lb deadlift max). This routine includes running, yoga, powerlifting, tabata-type stuff... the works. 4 days a week. 4\. Track spending again with my newly aligned budget. This one speaks for itself. I stopped entering each of my purchases into the Life Tracker in April. I want to start that back up and take it more seriously so I can address financial goals - an example of which is coming up very soon... 3\. Buy another automobile. Melissa and I have been sharing one for the past 11 months. Eventually we will be moving and I won't be able to walk to work anymore. I'd like to have the automobile issue settled well in advance of the "buying a house" issue (if we elect to go that route). 2\. Less "projects". This sounds counterintuitive - I'm doing 5 challenges simletaneously and one of them is to focus less on projects? How does that compute? Well, it makes sense to me. I'll explain more later. 1\. No Reddit/Google+/whatever. I want to eliminate the online timewasters from my life.

Motto: THOUGHTS! OPINIONS! WORDS IN AN ORDER TO CONVEY MEANING!

  
This post is literally only about my continued review on iOS vs Android. I thought of more stuff that I want to say since writing [Column #356](http://www.aarongilly.com/356). If that doesn't interest you, skip to the Top 5 then **get outta here!**

#### First thought:

In general - iOS and Android are basically the same at this point. They do the same stuff, just in very slightly different ways. The points made below are basically nit-picks.

#### Ways iOS & the iPhone are better:

It's super nice that basically everything is built to work with the iPhone. I just rented a car, and all it took was for me to plug my phone into the USB port of the car in order to interface with it. Audio just started working. I could access Siri by pushing a button on the steering wheel. That sort of thing _never_ happened with my old Nexus phones. They would just freak out when plugged into a car's USB port. When I went to get a case for my XS, I was overwhelmed by choice. My Nexus 6p case had to be ordered through Amazon, and even then there weren't a litany of choices.

  
I really like that after taking & sending screenshots you're asking if you want to keep them. I didn’t realize it but I almost always don’t care to save the screenshots I take. My old phone had a ton of screenshots filling up Google Photos I had to go back and mass delete. 

  
iOS is buttery smooth. I've not once seen a bit of input lag, or stuttering. It's just not a thing that happens. You think I'd have gotten used to this by now, but I still appreciate it every day.

  
The voice-to-text dictation input on the iOS keyboard is so much better than it is on Android... and it's for such a simple reason - the voice input doesn't timeout. On Android the voice input automatically stops if you take a short pause in your speech. So, if you're writing more than a tiny bit of text, you feel rushed to try to say everything all at once, which then causes you to make mistakes that you have to in after the fact and fix manually. That auto-stop was a design choice that someone at Google made and it was absolutely the wrong decision. I am more than happy to manually stop the voice input with a tap on the screen if it gives me the opportunity to stop and think about what I want to say in the middle of it. Google's voice input auto-stop is only better if you're using voice-to-text for short single sentences... and that's just not my primary use case.  
  
Having a consistent hardware experience allows apps to be tailored to that hardware in a way that Android apps cannot. The Sleep Tracking app I use utilizes the microphone. It shows my exact phone in its little first-time-setup tutorial thing. It knows the best orientation to position the phone and exactly how sensitive the mic is. No developer for Android has those luxuries, so there are not apps that can do that sort of thing as consistently.  
  
There's a time-tracking application on iOS called "Life Cycle". I don't know of any equivalent app on the Android side. If one exists, I bet it wouldn't be as good as this one is. Apps on iOS are, in general, just more polished and fully-featured. This coming from an avid Android user for 8+ years. Apps that exist on both platforms are better on iOS across the board thus far.  

#### Ways Android phones are better:

**Driving**. Driving with an Android phone is 100x less stressful than it is with an iPhone. This is for many reasons. 

  
One - I like Driving Mode, don't get me wrong. The phone not lighting up and distracting people while they are driving is a great thing... but it's implemented wrong. If I want to listen to a podcast or music on Spotify, I have to either queue it up BEFORE I turn on my car, or I have to turn off driving mode, start the audio I want to hear, then manually turn driving mode back on. If my car hasn't even left the garage yet, maybe let me do some basic stuff.

  
Two - Navigation is painful. Yesterday when navigating home from the airport, I said "hey Siri, navigate home". Siri responded by telling me I needed to reinstall Apple Maps. I don't want to use Apple Maps. It's not as good. So I had to pull over, then manually open up Google Maps, manually search for and start navigation to my house. THEN within 3 minutes of driving again I got a phone call, which took over my screen. No longer could I see the navigation, I had to try to hear what the Navigation voice was telling me to do... WHILE I was on a phone call. It was next-to-useless.

  
Three - FaceID is _horrible_ while in a car. I have to take my phone out of its mount and hold the phone way up in front of my face, or lean over stupidly to position my face directly in front of the mount, or type in my 6-digit passcode. ALL of these things are much much less safe than just quickly sticking my thumb on a fingerprint reader. That said, there's no reason for my phone to lock while I"m in my own car. Speaking of which...

  
Four - Android has a thing called "Smart Lock", which allows you to make your phone unlock when its around a trusted wifi or bluetooth connection. This is idyllic in situations like the car. So far as I can tell, no such feature exists on iOS. That forces me to confront the three things above over and over. 

  
I had an experience yesterday that combined **all four** of the above. It was terrible and made me question my decision to try out the iPhone. With my Android phone all this would take is "Okay Google Navigate Home" and I'd have zero problems. I drove all the way home thinking about how terrible this user experience was and wondering why I haven't heard everyone with an iPhone complain about these things. Maybe there are some settings I can change, but it shouldn't be this difficult. 

  
Speaking of difficult, adding loyalty cards to Apple Wallet is impossible. It doesn't work. The app itself doesn't let you do it. When I Google it, it tells me to just use the camera app, which has some "magical integration" with Apple Wallet. The problem with "magical integrations" is that when they don't work, they leave you no recourse. That's my biggest problem with Apple products. If you try to use them to do anything other than what they exactly expect, they make it very hard.

  
Widgets are nice. I didn't use them much, but having a calendar & to-do list on the home screen is more convenient than having to swipe to get them. Small gripe, because the widgets do exist, I just wish I could see one every time I went to the home screen.  
  
  
I still haven't really figured out how I want to tune my Notifications on iOS. I constantly have notifications I don't care about. I want my phone to ring when I get a call, otherwise I want it to shut up.   
  
There is a "swipe then tap" action that gets used in lots of places on iOS that I'm not a fan of. It's in their email app, their notification system, and a couple of other apps from 3rd parties. Why require two user inputs for one very common action? Archiving a bunch of emails is annoying.  

  
It's a bit too easy to accidentally take screenshots and a bit too difficult to turn off the phone.   
  
I definitely prefer being able to just put things where I want on the home screen. I don’t like the auto rearrange on the iOS home. You delete an app and everything shifts up. So then you have to go find a replacement app to put in the spot of the deleted app or retrain yourself to where your apps are. 

  
Oh and this isn't iOS-specific, but not having a headphone jack sucks. I was on a plane yesterday and my bluetooth headphones died. Then I had to charge them. I couldn't listen to anything while they were charging. I had to listen to the sounds of the plane, which made me realize I was sitting in what sounded like a plane full of people with the plague.

  
Those are my thoughts.

  
Top 5: Companies Whose Products I've Consistently Had Issues With

5\. Apple - Melissa's iMac died. Its replacement was expensive and has been under-performing to say the least.  
4\. Motorola - The OG Droid was great - butI creaked by riser My Moto 360 was spotty at best. It's now functional only as a clock, and only while it is actively being charged.  
3\. Samsung - This applies to both their Galaxy line of phones (the same ones that were exploding a few years back) and their laptops. My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was lackluster & needed reset from time to time. My old Chromebook had massive touchpad electrical issues. My new Chromebook has needed reset a couple of times. You'd think I'd learn from this one.  
2\. GoPro - I've technically owned 4 of these in my life. All 4 of them have, at one point or another, given me some sort of issue. Currently my GoPro Hero 5 Session is a paperweight. It won't turn on.  
1\. Ring - we are on our 3rd Ring video doorbell unit right now... and it's currently not working.

# Motto: "I/O" stands for "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! OH MY GOD!"

In seven days (May 15th) Google's annual developer's conference starts. The conference is called "Google I/O" where "I/O" stands for "Input/Output" (despite what the motto might say). It is the event during which Google unveils their big projects and products for the year. Last year, I/O gave us the Nexus 7 and Jelly Bean (among other things) - I wrote about my predictions last year in Column #9. 

The column I'm writing right now exists solely to get my Top 5 online before the conference so I can look back and see how good of a guesser I was. Also, I'm writing it just to say HOW EXCITED I AM FOR THE CONFERENCE. I am planning on watching as much of it live as possible - although I wish I were just going there.

In other news - a while back I was given a SQL database backup of one of the iterations of my old column. It was from back before college - around the time I was 16 to 18. The database was a total wreck when I first got it; there was easily more code than content... it was messy and unreadable. After hours of work and some out-of-the-box-type thinking, I was able to extract the content in a mostly readable format. Here's what some thoughts/conclusions I was able to pull from reading through some of it:

I wrote at least 375 columns before I started this (blogger) format... I did a very poor job of numbering them, though.
My old columns were shorter. This post would have made for a long column back in the day.
My old columns had several quotes per update.
I was mostly an annoying high schooler... although sometimes I said genuinely funny things.
I used to write a lot about how I didn't write enough.
I whine a lot (notice that wasn't past tense).
It's really interesting reading my thoughts about important things in the course of my life as they were happening.
I put WAY more than I should have on the internet. I'm glad this stuff is no longer accessible.
I am working on a list of highlights from the old column. There are hundreds of updates to read through, though, so it will be a while before that makes it on here.


I'm going to leave this off with a picture I haven't yet shared from my tour of the Googleplex:

That was the first of several photo ops with Google signs.

# Top 5: Predictions for Google I/O
5. Google Games - Google is going to do a lot of sessions related to gaming. It is a safe bet that they are going to announce a new Google-hosted game center for developers to tap into. We will see message boards, high score lists, and all sorts of stuff. Frankly, I don't care much for smartphone gaming. It's still good news, but I'm rather "meh" about it for now.
4. More news will come out about Google Glass and Google TV. These two projects are not related, but I pushed them together to avoid having to write any more about either one of them individually.
3. We will see lots of new things coming to Google Chrome. Most of them will probably be under-the-hood type things... but we may see one or two new tricks (hopefully the long-anticipated Google Now Chrome integration).
2. Google Babel - Whatever it's going to be named, Google will unveil their new messaging service. It is set to both replace and combine Google Talk, Hangouts, and Google+ Messenger. It will possibly also include SMS and Google Voice - but we'll see. I feel like I'm forgetting something important about this... it's the thing I'm looking forward to the most - other than...
1. Android 4.3 - Still named "Jelly Bean", Android 4.3 will release with possibly some new hardware. For the new hardware, I'm going to go with the Motorola/Google phone currently only known as the "X Phone". The X Phone is shrouded in mystery, but is said to focus mostly on battery life and durability... so who knows. We will also see 
a refresh of the Nexus 7 (probably with a full 1080p screen) and the Nexus 4 (probably with LTE). Both will remain extremely affordable for what they are and both will run 4.3 (as will the Nexus 4's and 7's already in the hands of consumers).

# Motto: Shallow and Pedantic

*Forewarning: This update is all about me. I apologize for the topic, unknown readers, but it's pretty much the only thing I write about. What are you doing here, anyway?*

That was an inside joke. Sort of.

I leave for Thailand in 4 days. But this post has nothing to do with that. That will be soon. Probably next time.

What this column IS about, as given away by the title, is Fitness and a semi-dramatic system re-tooling within my life. To tell you that story, let me set the stage with the way things were.

There was chaos. The streets ran wild with the long-forgotten children of who knows who. These kids knew they had to look out for themselves - nobody else was. Street fires burned for days. Fire departments had long since gone the way of the dodo and the police force. Did I say they were gone too? Yeah. They were gone. It was a pretty bleak scene. I didn't keep track of the foods I ate or where my money went to.

Like I said. Chaos.

Fast forward a few days. A young man burst onto the scene with an idea so earth shattering that the tall pillars of uncertainty and guesstimations shook and fell. Our hero goes by the name of Aaron. He lived in the swirling storm of chaotic calorie intake and money outflow for years. He was hopeless. Without hope. If his body was a dashboard with lots of needles and stuff and one of them said "hope", it would've indicated "less" - because he was hopeless. 

For years he lived this way.

One day, not too long ago (2 days ago), our hero was struck with an idea so simultaneously powerful and beautiful it bordered on - or very well could have been the product of The Divine. A bright illuminating beam of white light and wisdom, straight from the palm of God himself to the pre-frontal cortex of a hopeless soul. 

"Maybe I should keep track of what I eat and spend money on... so that I know what I eat and spend money on!"

It hit me like a tsunami.

I have the Demetri List (which my lovely girlfriend [just wrote about](http://melissalynnehill.blogspot.com/2013/04/at-my-best.html) in her blog, btw). I track how productive of a person I am. I should track how healthy I am living, both physically and financially. 

Okay I wasted most of the time I had allotted to write this column by making into some sort of weird dystopian alternate timeline dramatization. I'm going to now state the relevant facts in the only short way I know how - 

Important things that happened in the past 3 days:
* I saw my family for Easter. Like, all of them. It was awesome. I like them. 
* I found a webpage called "[Simple Science Fitness](http://simplesciencefitness.com/)" that is basically the product of one fitness enthusiast and designer who did tons of work and research putting this together. I didn't study biology, health, or exercise sciences in school, but it seems mostly legitimate to everyone I've asked so far.
* I decided I need to start tracking my diet. Calories. Protein. Sugars. Etc.
* I started keeping around a notebook. A plain and simple spiral notebook for jotting things down.
* I made a workout plan. I used to just meander in the weight room from lift to lift based on what I "felt like" doing. This led to a few key neglected areas.
* At the suggestion of my lovely girlfriend, I experimented with Google Forms as a method of keeping track of things. I love it. I can input things from my phone or tablet or computer in less than 30 seconds from homescreen to screen off. That 30 second mark is not just a guess, I just tested it. 28 seconds to put in the two terrible-for-me chimichangas I just ate.
* I got a grand idea for a Life Tracking System that unified all the things I wanted to keep track of. This is a work in progress. It will use Google Forms, Google Docs, and some Scripts that I have to learn how to write. It's going to be a fun, challenging, and rewarding process.
* That's basically it.
* Oh, and I cut together a video of all the athletic clips I've taken for the second-a-day video...

DISCLAIMER: The following video shows entirely too much shirtless Aaron. Content approved for mature and strong-stomached audiences only.

(editor's note: this video lost to time)

I just did an experiment to see how good my phone's camera's facial recognition software is. I drew cartoon faces with increasing levels of detail until it recognized one. The recognition happened way faster than I expected. I thought I was going to have to draw 5 or 6 faces. I probably took too big of a step. I should redo this later. Not now. Now it's late.

(editor's note: this picture lost to time)

If your phone has facial recognition, give it a shot. Does it see the guy on the right?

# Top 5: Best Things on the Internet (in a serious way, not like "this picture of a cat!")
5. Netflix - Netflix is really a placeholder for Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Spotify, etc. The internet is better entertainment than your television, your music collection, your movie collection, and the movie and music collection of everyone you've ever met.
4. Amazon - Everything you would ever want to buy... but cheaper. I've sold stuff on Amazon, too. 
3. Wolfram Alpha - Wolfram Alpha is the reason I wanted to make this list. It is a free calculation engine that is useful for ALL KINDS of stuff. I used it constantly during my time studying Electrical Engineering. Lately I've been using it for nutritional information. This is the sandwich I had for breakfast.
2. Wikipedia - anybody and everybody has access to an EMENSE encyclopedia that is always up-to-date and nearly as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica (as some studies show). We all have access to oceans of knowledge so large that we couldn't even begin to explore nary a corner during the course of our lives.
1. Google - Google search alone would be enough of a reason to put Google as number one. It's the index for the rest of the internet. This is not to mention things like Gmail, YouTube, or the myriad of other products and services they offer everyone for free. This blog is run on a Google service.

# First, Some Silliness

Because fun for the sake of fun is necessary.

## Me Executing on a Dumb Idea I Had

In case you need to alliteratively expand upon someone being in a ‘precarious position’, you can just say *“hey man, you’re in a...”*

- Assailable Area
- Bad Boondock
- Contingent Corner
- Dangerous District
- Exploitable Enclosure
- Fungible Fortification
- Gruesome Galley
- Hazardous Hotspot
- Insecure Island
- Jinxed Joint
- Killable Knoll
- Losing Locale
- Menacing Meadow
- Nasty Neighborhood
- Onerous On-ramp
- Precarious Position
- Quarrelsome Quarter
- Risky Region
- Seedy Sector
- Treacherous Territory
- Uncertain Underpass
- Vulnerable Vicinity
- Woeful Walkway
- Xenophobic X-way
- Yearnful Yard
- Zonked Zone

To maintain complete nerdcred, see my totally unnecessary footnote[^1].

## The Wiggles

After having two kids, I'm a genuine and unironic fan of The Wiggles. The current Wiggles, not the original ones. They consistently put out great content. They are fun. They aren't afraid to jump on a bandwagon of [things that are trending](https://youtu.be/zLDG7bTDWo4). 

The Wiggles are great. I think if somehow I were to hear them in 15 years I may break down crying, but that's a different story.

## VR

Virtual Reality is *cool*, man. Santa Claus brought an Oculus Quest 2 for Christmas while I was on the phone one day. I wasn’t expecting it, and I definitely didn’t expect I’d be playing it most nights still a month later. I never got into Guitar Hero or Rock Band all that much, but I’ve been enjoying the heck out of Beat Saber. Also the VR Mainstay of Super Hot I’ve nearly worked my way through for the 2nd time. The puzzler “I Expect You to Die 2” I’ve been trying to savor. My most recent pleasant surprise is Walkabout Mini Golf VR. What’s surprising about it is mostly how pleasant it is.

# Next, Some Site Updates

I made some updates to the About page. It’s better now.

## Coming Soon

My [home page](http://aarongilly.com) lists the “Main Attractions” of the site as [The Column](https://aarongilly.com/all/), [Gillespedia](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/), and my [Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b). Those are good. Arguably my [Notes](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea) should be considered a “Main Attraction”, but symmetry demands I have 3 secondary features to mirror the 3 main attractions.

What I’m changing, though, is a flip from a link to my public [General Operating Principles](https://www.notion.so/General-Operating-Principles-95a182cba7fd44a893970d3a04b97cc2) to instead point to a yet-to-exist page/repo about my longest running personal project. One which I’ve written about probably ~30 times in my 416 posts. It’s been re-re-re-renamed. This time I even bought a domain name. So look forward to that “big reveal”[^2].

## Gillespedia Article

I wrote a new [Gillespedia Article about Data Binding with Vanilla JavaScript](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/data-binding/). I think the Venn Diagram of people who I know read this and who might be interested in reading that looks like this:

# Notion Love Fest

Man. Notion is great. Actually, I *lament* how good it is. Historically, Google is the only company I've ever trusted Google with the amount of “important crap” that I let sit in someone else’s basket. But... there’s just nothing else out there that does what Notion does. The platform has only gotten **more** impressive and awesome since [I first heard about it](https://aarongilly.com/370-feature-aaron-information/). Every design decision and feature drop is exactly in line with how my brain works. 

I love the data design. I love the Markdown support and keyboard shortcuts. I love the database-as-a-main-organizational-feature. I love the design aesthetic.

## Example of Notion Somehow being Exactly My Jam

I just used Notion to draw up a Mermaid diagram when thinking out how a function in my Data Journal[^3] will work.

![a mermaid sequence diagram](assets/416-2.jpg)

If you’re not using Notion... well that’s fine I guess. But I love it.



# Top 5: Things I Recommend Tracking



## 5. Pains & Treatments

What hurts? What you did about it? A simple Google Form would be easy enough to build and use. Good for doctors visits. Great for self-awareness.



## 4. Spending

Sign up for Mint or Personal Capital. Or take a more hands-on approach and get a non-passive budgeting tool like You Need A Budget.



## 3. Fitness Tests

Define what “fitness” is to you. What do you want to be able to do? Then make some time every few months to see where you are. Catch slumps before they become rock bottoms.



## 2. Nightly Journal Entry

Take a couple minutes before bed to reflect on your day. What was good? How did you feel? Is there anything you need to remember?



## 1. Any Quantifiable Aspect of Who You Want to Be

That which gets measured gets managed. Measure yourself on your path to what is most fulfilling to you. For me, this is my [Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b).



# **Quote:**



> Failure is most useful when you give your best effort. If you fail with a lackluster effort, you haven't learned much. Perhaps you could have succeeded with a proper focus. But if your best effort fails, you have learned something valuable: this way doesn't work.  
> <cite>James Clear</cite>

[^1]: I’m aware of the fact that alliteration refers to repeated **consonant sounds**, and I used word pairs that violate this defintion, such as “Killable Knoll”. Also I’m aware of the term “assonance” refers to the use of repeated **vowel** sounds. But I didn’t want to sound like too much of an annoying assonance. 

[^2]: Cake will be served.

[^3]: Not being called that any more. I mean, maybe sometimes.

# Motto: I am a very lucky man

It's been basically a week since the last time I updated. This would normally mean I was a little busy, I had to work, I was away from the computer, or I just wasn't feeling particularly inspired. This time, though, it meant that I was just having an awesome week and I didn't want to remove myself from the moment at any point in time during said week. Let me consult my 5 year journal to see what happened this week.

Ah yes.

There have been 4 major events worth writing about since my last update. 

First, I spent time with friends. Saw Jon in Emporia. We shopped around and hung out at his new place. Saw my ex-residents in Lawrence. We watched movies and caught up. Also successfully made a taser out of a disposable camera without injuring anyone.

Second, I spent time with friends. Went to Kansas City with Melissa to a housewarming party of my former senior design partners/best friends from school. After the party we all slept in the common room of their apartment. There was 2 bodies per square meter, by my estimation. Some people slept in a closet, too. The next day, Melissa, Danielle, Lizzy and I went to the Google Fiber Space in Kansas City. Basically it's a satellite building of Google's main headquarters located in KC with one directive. The four of us were giddy like school girls the whole time we were in there - the three engineers in particular. There were fiber connected HDTVs and tablets and chromebooks EVERYWHERE. It was great. I connected to their Google Fiber Wifi Network and went to Google.com. Basically it was Google sending me itself. It was all very surreal. Some pictures follow.

![](assets/27-1.jpg)
Panorama of the space.

![](assets/27-2.jpg)
This contraption was fun to look at, even if the cars on the tract went disappointingly slow.

![](assets/27-3.jpg)
Computer action shot of all three girls.
Third, Melissa and I got to go on a couple proper fancy(ish) dates. We ate like royalty. We shopped in KC. We watched a couple movies. We talked. We had a good time. The kind of time you want to have always.

Fourth, randomly, and perhaps the nerdiest of all, I WAS THE TOP POST ON REDDIT. Not just the top post on some small sub... the TOP POST on the FRONTPAGE of ALL of Reddit. I think that properly made me king of the internet for that brief 5 hour window. The thing that got me on there was so incredibly dumb that I'm almost ashamed. I guess I will live with that shame and just post it here, too. The following image has been viewed, as of this writing, over 912,000 times:
![](assets/27-4.gif)

Nine Hundred and Twelve THOUSAND. When it hits a million I'm celebrating.

Last order of business, I am going to California TOMORROW for a WEEK. I am, amongst other things, seeing Sally, seeing my cousin Sharon, seeing the coast and beach, going to a improv show, taking a tour of the Family Guy studio from someone who works there, hiking to the Hollywood sign, watching a movie on a huge screen, touring CBS studios, eating fancy, and going to THE GOOGLEPLEX. 

You heard me.

The real-world actual GOOGLEPLEX in Mountainview, CA. I'm going there. I'm going to the Googleplex. I'm going to see the Android statues outside on the lawn. I'm going to carry my two Nexus devices into the headquarters where the software they run on was designed. I'm going to the Googleplex. 

I'm going to put in an application as a janitor. I'd take a job as a janitor at Google over electrical engineering anywhere else. Just saying.

I've look back on my life and I realized one thing above all others: I am a very lucky man.

Likely, my next update will happen in a week. It will probably be long and photo-dense. Even more so than this one.

# Top 5: Movies I've watched since my last post
5. "Meet Bill" - For some reason Netflix thought I would like this one. I didn't really.
4. "Envy" - a solid B movie. Not great. But enjoyable.
3. "I Love You, Man" / "Forgetting Sarah Marshal" - two movies. one night of Jason Segel. Both classics. 
2. "Airplane!" - even more classic.
1. "Warrior" - a drama about two brothers in the world of mixed martial arts. It's on Netflix instant play and it's really good.

It’s time for the annual year-in-review report card and goal-setting Column. I’ve been writing this post for a month now, so I hope it doesn’t suck.

# 2023 Year in Data

Checking in on goals I set in [Column #427](427), I did pretty well this year.

## Health

### Exercise

> [!success]
> *Goal:* 150 workouts  
> *Result:* 152 workouts

This was a **great** year in terms of health. Through great luck I managed to avoid major illnesses. Our family was healthy, for the most part, the whole year - for which I’m incredibly grateful.

This was my 2nd-most-exercised year on record. As a result, I look and feel about as good as I ever have.

![[447-1.svg]]

I’m particularly happy with this result, because it was accomplished in spite of a pretty debilitating injury I incurred thanks to a shovel and some dirt. See if you can tell when it happened.

![[447-2.svg]]

Another note on exercise - I've continued doing ~3-4 self-imposed fitness tests per year. [This system I proposed in Column #379](379) continues to work.

### Eating Out

> [!warning] Fair
> *Goal:* <125 times  
> *Result:* 134 times

This was a minor failure. Ultimately I’m not too upset about it. What’s more interesting is what correlations you can draw from the data and my life.

![[447-3.jpg]]

### Drinks

> [!success]
> *Goal:* …generally drink *better*  
> *Result:* fairly successful

I’m not much of a drinker, but I’m also not completely abstained to water. My tracking here is limited to those beverages that I consume that I don’t consider “healthy”. So, **this doesn’t include things like water, tea, black coffee, and powdered drink mixes**. Everything *outside* of that we’ll call a “*less healthy drink*”, which can be roughly divided into ~6 categories. My consumption of less healthy drinks **did** fall by 30% from 2022 to 2023. Interestingly, I had **exactly one *less healthy drink* per day in 2023** (assuming I don’t drink before midnight (bad assumption).

What’s slightly more interesting to me is the *mix* of drink types. I’ve broadened out. More categories. More even mix from each category. Not shown here, but even *within* categories things have broadened out more.

![[447-4.svg]]

### Sleep

I track it. It’s been better this year than any other year on record. Crazy what happens when your kid learns to sleep through the night. Life is better and I am good at sleeping enough and at consistent times.

## Content Creation

### Notes

> [!success]
> *Goal:* 150 new notes  
> *Result:* 230 new notes

This was the year that my collection of permanent “Evergreen” notes made the move from productivity multi-tool [Notion](https://www.notion.so) to the more fit-for-purpose application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). This transition was not without some level of sacrifice,[^1] but ultimately worth it. The notes are much more *durable* and in my control now that they are on my own computer. Also you get some benefits like this neat graphic showing the 230 new notes (and the connections between them) that I added in the past 365 days.

![[447-5.png]]

### Columns

I wrote 21 Columns this year, including this one. This was a marked *increase* from years passed. I didn’t have a goal for writing Columns, but I’m pretty pleased with the year in blogging.

### Other Stuff

I made heaps of doodles and little ad-hoc things I didn’t track.

## Content Consumption

My media consumption *dropped* this year. It wasn’t just my lack of books and movies, I also didn’t really watch much TV or play many games. This was due to a few factors. My kids are of the age that I can’t watch really *any* of the things I’d like to watch with them around. I spent way more free nights working on projects. Due to both of those factors, my intake of YouTube (filling in the cracks between things) has increased considerably.

### Books

> [!warning]
> *Goal:* finish 18 books  
> *Result:* finished 13 books

I read 13 books. This was less than I'd hoped for. Podcasts took over my book-listening to some extent.

The best was *probably* Recursion by Black Crouch. The worst was probably Nine Perfect Strangers.

### Movies

> [!warning]
> *Goal:* finish 30 new movies  
> *Result:* finished 20 new movies

I finished 20 new movies this year, and re-watched only 5. This I expect to increase alongside the relaunch of my movie-based podcast.

The best was Across the Spiderverse. The worst was Ant-Man: Quantumania.

### TV

I watched TV on 79 occasions. While that sounds like a lot, I’ll point out that’s only about 1.5 sessions per week. Also, as I’ve mentioned before, my tracking method for TV is a bit, strange. I don’t track individual episodes watched, nor time. I simply track *name of show* and *date*. So I could watch 10 episodes of Stranger Things in a day, and that shows up as 1. Meanwhile I could watch one episode each of Gen V and Invincible in an evening and that shows up as 2. Despite the poorly-controlled capturing mechanism, my TV intake is has pretty consistent over the past 5 years.

![[447-6.svg]]

I watched 21 unique shows this year. The best of them was Jury Duty. The worst of them was Secret Invasion.

### Games

Videogames I played on 47 occasions, but 30 of those occasions were Tears of the Kingdom, that’s rounded out by 4 sessions of “I Expect You to Die 3”, 6 sessions of Mario Wonder, and 7 of Walkabout Mini Golf. My gaming is incredibly “bursty” and associated with particular games.

![[447-7.jpg]]

### Podcasts

Looking at those results, you might conclude I’ve been *less* engaged with media than usual this year. That is true, to some extent, but I think a large portion of my media-intake switched to YouTube and podcasts. I don’t actively track those, because they’re tracked for me. I **doubled** my (already huge) podcast listening time from 2022 to 2023. 

### YouTube

The real problem is **YouTube**. YouTube has almost certainly taken up more screen time than TV shows and movies **combined**. 

There are a number of issues with the *data* surrounding my relationship with YouTube. First, Google doesn’t make “time watched” available for anything other than the past week.[^2] Secondly, my account is signed into YouTube on the family TV. So I reckon a **lot** of the increase starting in 2019 was comprised of videos watched by my children. All that said, the trendline is both clear and troubling:

![[447-9.svg]]

## Social

This Column is going on long, and I don’t need to write a ton about my social life, relationship, and family on the internet. I track some high-level aspects of these things. They all didn’t receive enough attention in 2023, and will become a higher focus in 2024.

# 2023 Year In Projects

This has been a productive year. The following is an incomplete list of things we did. 

## Vacations

We took a few! Las Vegas (x2!). The Black Hills of South Dakota. Lake of the Ozarks. These are projects, per my definition. They took work to do and resulted in a thing.

## Personal Data Warehouse

I wrote about this already! See [here](https://aarongilly.com/pdw/). What I didn’t write was my personal disappointment with the amount of time I sunk into the project. It was meant to be the final ground-up rewrite of the system. That’s still the plan, thankfully. It *is* better now, too.

## Aaron’s Puzzles

I migrated my branding from “Get in to Win” to the more personalized “[Aaron’s Puzzles](http://aaronspuzzles.com)”. 

### New Logo(s)

While I haven’t fully locked in a new “overall” logo, I’ve settled on a design that I like. Each box with its own color palette. The overall logo (as of right now) is the one on the top left. 

![[447-8.png]]

### The Vault

This puzzle box was made in 2022… but I reimplemented the digital aspects of The Vault in SvelteKit. Essentially a ground-up rewrite.

### The Cookie Jar

My Puzzle Box for 2023 was The Cookie Jar. Its specific contents are meant to be a secret, but it includes: 

- A custom box built out of scrap wood I had around
- Several more custom components I built from wood
- Several coding projects
- Several drawings, and *very* lightweight animations.
- A video I made with my family, which was great fun

## Home Renovation

We made our house better by:

- Installing new lights in the kitchen, living room, and back yard
- Installing some new drainage features **this sucked and I claim much credit**
- Replacing a fan (or 2)
- Replacing some bad carpet with good laminate

# Goal Setting - Areas

In [Column 441](441) I wrote about my Notion-based personal productivity system. One part of the system was left off for the sake of simplicity - areas. Here’s that graphic again, with the inclusion:

![[441-1.svg]]

“Areas” is an idea I’ve lifted from Tiago Forte’s “[PARA Method”](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/). They’re those things in your life that don’t have an end date. Some facet or feature of your life that you have a responsibility to maintain. Things like health, finances, relationships, work, et cetera. I’ve chosen to represent those in Notion as a database, which is linked to my Goals and Projects databases.

One particularly useful feature of having a literal list of Areas to work with is that the goals I’ve set for this year are associated with the members of this list. Setting my goals was a [commitment inventory](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/commitment-inventory) exercise I accomplished on accident. Nice. 

Anyway, the system works really nicely. I recommend it.

# Top 4: Tracking Goals for 2024

## 4. Content Creation

- Write ~18 Columns
- Add ~200 new notes
- Maybe reintroduce the concept of tracking ad-hoc creations

## 3. Content Consumption

- Read 18 books
- Watch 36 new movies
- Play through 2 videogames
- Keep the pace on TV viewing (~75 tracked sessions)
- Watch less YouTube, lower that trendline
- Slow down on Podcast listening, too

## 2. Social

- Capture more *quotes*, I only tracked 18, I should be getting more like 60
- See more friends, more often
- See more family, more often
- Go on more dates
- Take the kids to a wider variety of outings

## 1. Health

- Keep up the good work on sleep
- Continue to both reduce and broaden my quantity of non-healthy drinks
- Workout 183 times - this is every other day, and is admittedly an ambitious number, but is in-line with my past 3 months
- Eat out 122 times - that’s once every 3 days, which a minor reduction from my usual cadence

# Top 6: Project Goals for 2024

## 6. Vacations

More of them. For each year only comes but once. These boys are less young every day. We need to get our time in while they still think their parents are cool. I’d like to take one or two more than we did this past year.

## 5. Add a modestly-sized new feature to the PDW

I want to find the balance between **in too deep** in coding projects, and too long between drinks, **now scared to touch it**. Right now I’m planning on adding a couple of capabilities to the PDW.

## 4. Finish some more house projects

I’d like to focus a bit more on the house in 2024. The basement needs work. There’s a shower that’s still an empty void. Every time I do a thing to improve the house I think to myself “man, why did I wait so long to do this?”

## 3. Start Up a Podcast

Technically, this is already done! More to come - both in terms of podcast episodes and things to say about it. 

## 2. Create another Puzzle Box

In 2022, I made The Vault.

In 2023, I made the Cookie Jar.

In 2024, I’ll make something new. I've already got ideas I'm excited about.

## 1. Migrate this website

While this website is infinitely better than its previous instances *(e.g. tumblr, blogger)*, it’s still not *as* in my control as I would like. Under the hood, I’m using Jekyll, which is a Ruby-based static-site generator. I’m thinking I’ll move to Astro, which is Node-based and capable of much more than simple static site generation. My goals are pretty simple:

- Migrate all of my existing content
- Host my body of Notes
- Integrate *(to some extent)* with [aaronspuzzles.com](http://aaronspuzzles.com)

# **Quote:**

> What’s up? Chicken butt!
> Alexa, add chicken butt to the shopping list!
> <cite>My 3 year old has been hearing interesting things at daycare</cite>

[^1]: I haven’t yet figured out how I want to publish my notes to the internet, for example. That used to come “for free” as part of Notion’s amazing feature set.
[^2]: 24 minutes per day this week, by the way - down 64% from last week

# Motto: Three days in...

I have been taking this "Yes" thing more seriously than I expected. So far I haven't turned down an opportunity, invitation, or suggestion. I have regretted nothing (well, after it was done I didn't regret it). I still have done relatively little, in retrospect, but I have said "yes" when I would otherwise have said "no" at least once a day. Resulting in a lot more pictures and videos in the past three days than usual... because I've done a lot more than usual. That's not saying much.

The Engineering Binder (my long-term project of summarizing everything I learned in engineering school) is now a glorious 44 page word document. 22 of those pages are actually full of content... the others are skeleton pages, table of contents, cover page, etc. I worked on it for 6 hours yesterday. Had a great time doing so.

I've been using Evernote a lot. I really like it; which is funny, cause I used to loathe it. It is my new quotepad. It is my companion for the Engineering Binder. "Tags" as a file structure... I get it now! I wish my computer could be organized that way. I don't wish enough to see if it's possible, though.

Life is good.

Going to Indiana in 2 days.

Life is good.

# Top 5: Things I've learned since starting this whole "yes" thing... picture edition
5. I actually could do the down and back with the tire (even three sets!)

![tire](assets/13-1.jpg)
4. I can enjoy healthy(ish) meals!

![this was healthy to me back then](assets/13-2.jpg)
3. I am capable of basic cooking (the previous sandwich I had supervision for, this one I made solo)

![sammy](assets/13-3.jpg)
2. I do enjoy reading, if the book is right.

![yes](assets/13-4.jpg)
1. I can do a frontflip into a pool... sorta.

I finally made good on my excitement for the Notion API.

# Motivation

My motivation here was use-case driven. I had a weird split of “to dos” in my life. Some were managed in iOS Reminders app. Others were included in the “Projects” database in my Notion. I tried finding a task manager that could meet the following requirements:

1. Set a task **deadline** as a separate thing from a “due date”
2. Set a “flagged” status (or functional equivalent) for things I want to focus on ‘soon’ without setting arbitrary due dates
3. Had a widget that allows me to see my tasks due **today/overdue**, with deadlines **this week**, or tasks I’ve flagged.
4. Works well with Siri so I can input new tasks without touching my phone.

Long story short, I didn’t find an app I *liked* that met all my criteria. Then I thought, “Hey, Notion has an API… I bet I can make it do some of the things it doesn’t natively do”. Turned out I was right.

# New Architecture

My Notion Architecture was split into separate workspaces. Formerly I just had the ‘Aaron’ workspace with *everything*. I’ve split out the “Knowledge Base” databases into their own workspace, separate from the “Main” Workspace.

Here is is presented as an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.notion.so/Entity-Relationship-Models-f44979f1538e4da5b86dc2d38d4ae15f).

## Notion-Based Task Management

Notion is the most incredible, versatile digital tool I’ve ever seen. But it lacks certain basic features you’d want from a primary task manager. I’m going to end this Column early and simply use that as my Top 5.

In short, though, I figured out how to make Tasks work in Notion pretty well utilizing their API. Now I only use iOS Reminders for edge cases, like location-based reminders.



# Top 5: Overcoming Task Management Shortfalls in Notion



## 5. Task Clutter - Design a Heavily Constrained View

Design your task workflow and management such that you’re typically interacting with a smaller set of tasks. I never look at a view “all tasks”. Instead I look at my “Short List” for things that are overdue, due today, have a deadline within a week, or are flagged for priority. This keeps the list very manageable.  



## 4. Hard to Access - Use Siri Shortcuts to Read Them to You

“**Hey Siri, What’s on my short list?**” - this is my trigger phrase that runs a Siri Shortcut that fetches (via API) what’s meets my ‘short list’ criteria, then reads them to me out loud.



## 3. Hard to Input - Use Siri Shortcuts to Write Them

“**Hey Siri, New Task**” - this is the trigger phrase that runs a Siri Shortcut that asks me for further input wherein I can stipulate what task I need to accomplish. If I include something Siri recognizes as a date, it will assign that date as the task’s due date. If it doesn’t include a date, it goes to my Notion Inbox database.



## 2. No Recurring Tasks - Use a Helper Script

Every night a Google Apps Script I wrote fires off a fetch request to the Notion API looking for any Tasks in my database that are checked “Done” that have a non-empty “Recurs” property. If it finds any, it then sends off another web request for each completed recurring task in which it resets the “Done” property and moves the Due Date out in accordance with whatever rule I’ve put in the “Recur” property[^1].



## 1. No Widget - Build a Custom One

Using the “Scriptable” app I was able to build a widget that fired off a web request that mimicked my Short List, then presents it on my home screen. 

I am using Scriptable’s device APIs to query my calendars for today. Events get displayed at the top of the widget. Under the dotted line is tasks directly from Notion.  
Tapping any of the items listed opens directly to that page in Notion.  
Tapping the ➕ allows me to enter a new task by hand.  
Tapping 🙊 allows me to dictate one.  
The 🔄 button refreshes the widget.

Also yes we bought a Tesla. It’s awesome.

[^1]: My implementation of ”Recur” allows you to set an quantity, a unit, and whether or not to recur from the time of completion or the time the task is due. So my "Take Out Trash" task has recur "1 week from due" whereas the "clean the cat litter" has recur "2 days from done"

# Motto: Don't Panic.

![](assets/42-1.jpg)
BSOD

My current computer is crashing on a multiple-times-per-day basis now. It's a little over 4 years old and has been needing to be put to rest for a while. Given that I know technology and what-not, I've decided I am going to build my next computer myself. Seems obvious now, I don't know why I didn't think of it before. It's going to be built specifically to suit my needs. This essentially means I'm going to build a computer specifically for video editing. There will be more on this at a later date... I have a couple of Nexus devices I want to get before the computer time ever comes.

Having a job and money is so much better than college was it's not even funny. Whoever said "college is the best time in your life" must have not went through an engineering program. Don't get me wrong, college as great... but would I rather be doing that than what I'm doing now? No fricken way.

Most negative words seem to start with the letter D. Destroyed. Desolation. Despair. Despot. Destitution. Disaster. Disgust. Death. Dying. Dead. Deranged. Demon. Devil. Douchey. Dick. Downhearted. Downtrodden. Depression. Disparage. Despicable. Dismal. Demeaning. Dark. Drab. Dull.

As with any rule, there are exceptions... as evidenced in the following sentence:
My darling dearest dined on some delightful and delicious donuts. 

In order for my title to work out, I'm going to have to talk about life, the universe, and everything... I think rather than doing that, I'll cop out with the following:

I was never a fan of the board game "life". Those who die with the most money still die.
The universe is big.
And Britanick's video entitled "everything" is hilarious, if a bit not safe for work.
Something mildly interesting I found out during the writing of this column: "Coldplay" has two different songs whose titles could be considered direct references to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Huh.

Speaking of Hitchhiker's Guide - here's a relevant XKCD.

I get the feeling that the 2 people who read this don't take the time to go to the links I put on here. I might dial those down a bit for future columns if nobody objects.

Oh, I watched "Skyfall". It's good. I recommend it. There's something so endearing about a timeless character like James Bond. As I was telling Melissa, in many ways Jason Bourne came up and smacked James Bond up and down the block. It's pacing and action sequences were unmatched and really outshined any Bond flicks... but Jason Bourne will never be the character James Bond is. He just won't.

# Top 5: Favorite quotes from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series (or what I've read of it)
5. '42' said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
4. Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous.
3. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. (not so much this quote itself, but the whole "towel" thing, I loved) 
2. The ships hung in the sky, in much the same way bricks don't.
1. The story so far: In the beginning the universe was created. This has made a lot of people angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

# Motto: This Motto isn't Orange, it's Golden.

Yesterday a few things happened. My new Nexus 4 became my official "make calls on" phone. My Galaxy Nexus went to my father... as did my old phone number. I got a new phone number. I signed up for a Google Voice number. I became no longer funded by my parents on one more thing. The last step between me and full-blown adulthood is the fact that I still drive around a hand-me-down car. That will change one of these months. With that, I'll be on my own car insurance, and I'll be 100% self-funded.

Why get a Google Voice number? If you are REALLY  interested, watch [this minute and a half video Google made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cOZU7BOeQ58). There are two reasons I got Google Voice, none of which are listed on that video -
1. There was a Google service that existed that I wasn't using... of course I want it. I want to be knowledgeable in ALL facets of Google services such that I'm capable of fielding ANY question about any of them. This is the same reason I really want to get a Chromebook. 
2. The ability to search for and pick out my own phone number. 

The phone number I was assigned is actually pretty good. I'm not going to put it online, but it's fairly easy to remember. It has a ring to it and is somewhat repetitive somewhat repetitive. 

My Google Voice number, however, is way more awesome. The area code I'll keep to myself, but the last 7 digits are so cool and nerdy I just have to share:

6180339

What? Why is that cool and nerdy?

The [Golden Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), represented by the Greek letter Φ (Phi), is 1.6180339. The Golden Ratio is an amazing number for many other reasons. The Top 5 will go into 5 of them. One of its properties, though, is that it is larger than its own reciprocal by 1. In other words:

1/1.6180339... = 0.618339...

So. My phone number is:

(Area code), 1/Φ

And that's awesome.

Semi-related story:

If I live in Kansas whenever I get a new car, I'm getting a vanity license plate that reads "Aaron". You would probably say "good luck with that", but I found [this website](https://www.kdor.org/personalizedplatelookup/Default.aspx) that allows you to search for available plates. As of right now, my name is still available. I have tried several other common names, none of them have worked.

Both times I thought, "I can't believe this is still available!"

I sincerely hope to make that license plate a reality someday. You can call it tacky if you want, but if you do, I will exercise my right to call you wrong. 

Deep Thought: The box that the contains the garbage bags you buy usually ends up in one of the bags it contains. 

Also, I think I'm going to start hiding movie/tv show references in the column on purpose. I do them all the time as it is, but I think it would be fun to start intentionally using them. The title of this column, for example.

# Top 5: Other Reasons the Golden Ratio is Awesome
5. It is the ratio for which this is true:
![](assets/52-1.svg)
From Wikipedia

4. It is the ratio of successive terms in the Fibonacci sequence as it approaches infinity. This also leads to the following picture, showing the Golden Spiral:
![](assets/52-2.svg)

From Wikipedia

3. It shows up here:
![](assets/52-3.svg)

From Wikipedia

2. It has been a part of human culture for centuries. It's present in music, art, architecture, and many other things we create. Example - it is approximately the ratio of the length of the base to the height of the Pyramids at Giza. Also, look at the Parthenon:
![](http://www.eatthedamncake.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/golden-parthenon.jpg)

1. Oh, and it shows in so many other places in nature (especially the human body), that Leonardo Da Vinci (and others) referred to it as the "Divine Proportion". If you are of a faith that believes the universe was created by a supreme being, I think it's safe to say this is one of his favorite numbers. Right up there with Pi and e. Examples of the Golden Ratio in the human body (from this [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+golden+ratio+in+the+human+body):
![](assets/52-4.gif)

Yeah, my phone number is cool.

I make no claim at being **good** at any of this.

# Extended Preamble

This is not going to live up to your expectations.

Creation is like love. It comes from a place so deeply seeded within that it doesn’t feel like it can be treated like just any other topic. It’s not easy to write about. It's not easy to explain. If you don’t feel the urge to make things that didn’t used to exist… I can’t help you with that. 

I can't explain why I want to make things. I just do, so I just do.

What this Column is about is a how-to guide for (one-implementation of) the *mechanics* of making. It will start after the point at which an inspiration and desire has struck.

## Economics of Creation

I am privileged. While financial considerations are made in what transpires below, I recognize and appreciate the position I am in to even feel like I could begin to write this Column. 

```mermaid

```

I am only qualified to talk about some pieces of that diagram. I've literally never once converted a podcast, blog post, video, poem, drawing, woodworking project, electronics project, website, or puzzle for money… but I've certainly **spent** $1000s in the pursuit of creation[^1]. 

I think if I tried to create for money it would take away something from the process - or maybe that's the story I tell myself because I'm afraid nobody would pay me for the things I make.

# Creations

## Writing

Literally just pick a thing to write in and write whatever comes to mind. If you want other people to read it, see the next paragraph.


Money in: probably none


Money out: probably none, unless you have some sort of hookup. I’ve got friends who’ve made money writing.

## Blogs and Websites

There are so so so many ways to write a blog or make a website for free[^2]. All it takes is a tiny bit of willingness to learn.

There are dozens if not hundreds of ways to do this. Here are 4 broad approaches, ranked from easiest to least easy.

1. Squarespace or something. Pay them probably $10/month. I'm sure they make it easy.
2. Google’s Blogger and other “blogs for free” services exist. You have the least control over this type of service. Your blog is actually theirs. You just wrote it. 
3. Use a static site generator, like Jekyll or Hugo. This is what this blog is. 
4. Build a fully-custom static site using whatever technology you like. This is the approach my Personal Data Warehouse and puzzle box project both use. 

My process involves writing my post out in Notion. Then copy/pasting it from Notion into a plaintext document on my computer. Notion automatically includes the necessary markdown to maintain formatting. I do a couple of tweaks to ensure the images look right, and then click a button in Visual Studio Code that pushes the new text file to my GitHub repository. Viola that’s it.


Money in: as little as you want.


Money out: probably not a ton. Or if you're like me and don’t put advertising anywhere then just straight up zero.

## Coding

Coding is a hobby of infinite depth. You can pick up coding and literally never stop learning new stuff and getting better. You can code for fun. You can code to learn how to make (a lot) of money. You can make websites, apps for devices, or do work in cyber security. Coding helps (but is not required) for the paragraph above and the paragraph below.

There are lots of good ways to get started coding. It helps to have some sort of an idea of a thing you'd like to make... but even if you don't have that there are plenty of bootcamps or courses you could take. I'm mostly self-taught, which means I learned from *everywhere* rather than through some formal training. That said I did use https://freecodecamp.org to great effect. 

In terms of the mechanics of coding, it obviously depends on what you're working with. If you, like me, are doing mostly web-based stuff - it's easiest to pick some framework you want to work with and run through whatever the setup procedure is for that. I start by using Vite (my preferred tooling solution) to scaffold a new project in whatever framework, then pushing to a new Git Repo on [Github](https://github.com/aarongilly) from within VS Code. From there it's crazy widely varied according to what you want to do.

If you're wanting to make an app for iOS or Android, you'll need XCode on your Mac or Android Studio on whatever computer you have. I've got less experience with both of those, but they both have "new project" workflows. I'm looking forward to finishing my current Personal Data Warehouse re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-rewrite so I can spin up an iOS/iPadOS based version and learn how to develop on those platforms.


Money in: zero, assuming you already own a computer.


Money out: Potentially a *ton*. Even if you don’t make a best-selling application, just being **able to** make an application is enough to get you good jobs.

## Making Puzzles

Unless you have an absolutely killer idea, it’s best to get started making a puzzle by first determining who you’re making it for and how they will interact with it. If you’re making something for someone for their birthday party, it probably shouldn’t be for **just them** and take their whole night. If you’re making something that’s repeatable, it needs to be general and be able to be re-assembled.

When making puzzles, it’s rare (if not impossible) to come up with something wholly unique. Generally there are only so many types of puzzles that exist, and what’s done nearly all the time is finding fun or unique ways to mask what they are or combine them in novel ways.

I started by identifying the constraints I wanted to work within. It needed to be portable, cheap, accessible to anyone, and doable in roughly 45 minutes. I liked the puzzle box concept, from having used it in the past. From there I brainstormed themes that might both be fun to work within and explain **why** someone was trying to open a box. 

Always keep an eye open for things that can be used as puzzle pieces. [Everything is a remix](https://youtu.be/zd-dqUuvLk4). I had a few ideas I was really enthused about, and thought about what they needed as inputs and what they provided as outputs. Generally a puzzle gives you physical access to something or tells you information… and solving puzzles requires physical access to something or information. It’s reciprocal.

```mermaid
graph TD
  Information --> pp(Puzzle Piece)
	pk(Physical Key) --> pp
	pp --> i(Information)
	pp --> py(Physical Key)
```

Basically a puzzle is just a chain of puzzle pieces. Ideally not presented sequentially (like dominoes) and using a nice mix of varieties of puzzles and also in terms of quantities of inputs required and outputs produced. 


Money in: basically as much or as little as you want. Write “you suck” on a piece of paper and cut it up and give it to your buddy to reassemble. Free fun.


Money out: probably none. Even if you’re me.

## Video Creation

Okay by this point in the Column I’ve realized I’ve been way more than I should chew so we’re speeding up.

You don’t need a fancy camera to make good looking videos. You do need better lighting, probably. Film outside or near a bunch of windows. Video editors are more or less all equally capable at this point. Something like iMovie would totally suffice for the average Joe. If you have more money and want to spend more time tweaking and messing with how things look, then you can move on to bigger products. There's an **incredibly** long tail to this, though. You can get a great looking video out of iMovie and good lighting and garbage out of Final Cut Pro with bad lighting.

The iPhone 14 with Cinematic Mode shooting works really well with Final Cut Pro. I got it for $100 as part of a student discount + Family sharing perk cause my wife is a teacher. Now that I have a legitimate video editor that isn’t constantly trying to sell me on upgrades and effects packs, I doubt I’ll ever switch to anything else.


Money in: you need a phone or a camera at a minimum. Lighting helps. A computer on which to edit video is also essentially required. After that costuming and props and whatnot can get expensive.


Money out: YouTube **can** earn you money. Realistically, though, you’re not likely to make a killing in terms of money out versus money in unless you’re lucky.

## Making

Honestly what was I doing with this. Making depends on what you’re making. Just try to make the thing. Google and YouTube are your friends. Don’t go crazy buying supplies or equipment until you’re sure you have a good, immediate need for the thing. You’ll end up with a drawer full of stuff you never use.


Money in: Hard to quantify. Almost certainly you’ll be spending at least *some*, potentially a lot.


Money out: none, unless you sell stuff. You can make decent money on Etsy, or so I’ve been told. If you make a thing that can also be mass produced easily - then boom you’re golden.

## Music

If you've got an instrument. Play the instrument. If you’ve got a Mac or an iPad, play around with GarageBand. It’s **awesome…** and super fun. And, much like coding, is an incredibly **cheap** hobby in the long run. You can continually learn and get better forever, and spend essentially $0 while you’re doing it. Unlike coding, music naturally lends itself to shared social experiences (jam sessions, singing together, or playing as part of a band) which are very rewarding in and of themselves[^3].

If you have a guitar: EADG. Boom you now know guitar. (I included this bit to annoy Ed, if he reads it. HI ED)


Money in: an iPad’s worth, or a keyboard or guitar or whatever (or none: just sing)


Money out: probably none, unless you’re pretty good and try to make money with it.

## Drawing

Just draw the thing. YouTube tutorials if you’re having a hard time. Classes also exist but definitely aren’t required. Just draw the thing. If you’ve got an iPad and Apple Pencil you have effectively infinite access to what's necessary and used by professional artists. If you don't have those, you just need paper and something that leaves lines on paper.


Money in: an iPad’s worth… or none


Money out: probably none

# Conclusion

See everything above. I’m biased. Sorry this was so long. Hopefully you just didn’t read it.



# Top 5: Standards that Suck



## 5. Live far apart and drive everywhere

Cars suck. The fact that America is built around the assumption that everyone has ready access to a car is bad. If I could live in a world wherein I rode my bike everywhere and wasn’t in danger of being mowed down by an F250 with one person in it that’s never hauled anything…. that would be great.



## 4. Kids clothing sizes

So kids clothes are just… impossible. What’s 4T in one brand may be more like 6T in another. Also the numbers sort of correlate to age, but also not really. Each kid is too unique. They should just be based on weight and height. Boom. Unambiguous and straightforward. Yeah you’d have to know how much your kid weighs and how tall they are, but you can measure those things independently, and then know them for every single store you might go to.



## 3. Subjective rules in sports

[I’ve written about this before](https://aarongilly.com/322). That list was basically for comedic purposes… but the fact that so much subjective judgement is wrapped up in a thing that so many people care about so much is unfortunate. 

THAT WAS A CHARGE! NO THAT WAS A DEFENSIVE FOUL! NO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO CALL!

THAT WAS HOLDING! NO IT WAS FAIR PLAY!

BALL! NO STRIKE!

I don’t follow sports in any way, shape, or form - and still I’ve heard enough cries of unfair calls in my life. Part of the reason I like pool is that the “judges” in pool almost **never** get involved. Generally it’s pretty objective. Track & field is good, too. I’m just not fast enough to partake.



## 2. The hierarchy of calendars

It's an unfortunate fact that the year is basically 365 days long. The prime factorization of that number is 5 and 73, so that doesn't leave a lot of flexibility, admittedly, but this is ridiculous:

1 year = 12 months. 1 month = 31 to 28 days. 1 month = 5ish weeks. 1 week = 7 days.

I still wish we had a month & week system like this:

1 year = 12 months. 1 month = 6 weeks. 1 week = 6 days. 

The extra 5 days (or 6 on leap years) would be a holiday, happen all at once, not really be considered a week or a month, and mark the transition between years. If that system doesn't sound easier than what we’ve got then you’ve never tried coding things that involve dates or organizing long-term projects. Also a 4 on 2 off work week sounds so much better than 5 on 2 off.



## 1. Red and Green Color Coding

When it comes to generic color coding schemes, the most prevalent convention is to give green and red opposite meanings. Whether it's “good and bad” (like what you'd see in a business dashboard) or it's “go and stop” (traffic light), we have decided to use specifically these two colors the most often. You know what else these to colors show up in the most often? Colorblindness. The red-green color blind variant is the most common one.

We could have collectively chosen any two colors to mean opposite things. If you require them to be on opposing sides of a color wheel you have two other choices. “orange/blue” or “yellow/purple” would both be more widely discernible, but no. 

If you're colorblind, I'm sorry for being complicit in this wrong choice and how it's affected you.

[^1]: …just this year ….and it's March

[^2]: If you **do** care about having a custom URL (something like [https://aarongilly.com](http://aarongilly.com), for example) you will need to pay for it to be listed in a Domain Name Server (aka “DNS”, aka the thing that turns “google.com” into an IP Address of one of Googles servers). That is not expensive. I pay $12/year through Google Domains for to make it so aarongilly.com takes you to my website. If your satisfied with something like [aarongilly.github.io](http://aarongilly.github.io) then you don't need to pay money.

# Ads Part 2
Great news! The ads are gone *immediately*!

I thought I'd have to run the experiment for 6 months to gather necessary data... but my $0.03 over the past week beg to differ! There's some disconnect between the numbers Cloudflare is showing for traffic to this site and the numbers Google was saying they were able to serve ads to. Possibly ad blockers. More likely bots. Regardless it's fine! **IT'S FINE I SAY JUST DROP IT.**

# Miscellany
## Cursed Business Locations
Doesn't it seem like some *buildings* simply **refuse to house sustainable businesses**? Some locations just... don't work. For seemingly *no* reason businesses in certain buildings around town (every town I've ever stayed in) seem to **fail**. The businesses themselves are not necessarily to blame, in fact they are often quite good... but there are some sites that absolutely refuse to succeed... while a business *right next door* can draw heaps of customers. 

The plaza around [the AMC 28 in Olathe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/AMC+DINE-IN+Studio+28/@38.9061594,-94.7683653,17.46z/) houses several eateries. There are two buildings in that immediate area that have housed a number of equivalent dining establishments - and for whatever reason they simply die out. Meanwhile the Texas Roadhouse there is always packed.

Here in Lawrence several places have tried to make [this building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3080+US-59,+Lawrence,+KS+66046/@38.9287332,-95.2609389,18.55z) (and the one directly north of it) work, and all have failed. Despite the fact that they're incredibly prominent in one of the most highly-passed through intersections in town. 

It just feels like the entire population learns to look past certain locations and they become cursed. You'd be better off to raze the building to the ground and put an apartment there, because nobody's going to that particular structure otherwise... no matter what you put in it.
## Life
Life is great. My 6 and 3 year old recently turned into a 6 and 4 year old. I've been doing a pretty good job lately of smelling the roses.

Actually, I've run into a problem wherein I've not used enough vacation at my job, thus I'm forced to use-it-or-lose-it... which means I actually have some *time* for a change. It's weird! I'm, of course, finding ways to eat that up to make it feel like it's gone before it starts. Such is life, I suppose.

I'm also an endless font of time consuming project ideas.
## Project 1-Liner Status Updates
- PDW re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-rewrite: more or less done - there's always "one last thing", though.

# Top 5: Free Foods You Get for Free Before the Meal
Aka "Top 5: Foods Most Likely to Make Aaron Lose His Abs". 
Aka "Top 5: Salt and Butter Delivery Devices"
## 5.  Chips & Salsa
Any Mexican restaurant. It's half the reason you *go* to Mexican restaurants. If you aren't greeted at the table with chips & salsa when you sit down, go find a better place to eat.
## 4. Breadsticks
Whether I'm at the Olive Garden or at a Fazoli's, the *real* meal comes before whatever I pay for... and I reckon I get more calories through the 8+ of these I eat than whatever comes after them.
## 3. Cinnamon Butter Rolls
A staple of Texas Roadhouse. I go through no fewer than 4 of these *before* ordering too large of a meal but finishing it anyway. Making my belly *Texas-sized*.
## 2. Cheddar Bay Biscuits
I don't do Red Lobster often, but when I eventually go back there it will be 100% because of these delicious terrible incredible awful delights.
## 1.  Chips & Queso
Actually getting chips & **queso** for free is an extreme rarity - but the El Potro in South Lawrence does it. That place rocks.

TL;DR - this may be my last post for a bit, then when I _do_ start up again, everything will look different and my ~1.5/month cadence will probably slow down some for a while.

# Someday I’ll…

I’m not sure what’s inspired everything below. Perhaps it’s the “hard” effects of 75 Hard. Perhaps it’s turning 36 soon. Perhaps it’s the cumulative pent up “some day I’ll ____” which have finally achieved activation energy. Maybe it’s all of the above. Maybe it’s the input and support from my friends who’ve inspired me to _just do the thing_. Thanks guys.

# I’m Going to Master Something

I was just accepted into a Masters in Data Science program at a local college[1](https://aarongilly.com/457/#fn:1). I’m going back to school. This ends the decade of:

**Someday I’ll get a Masters Degree**

The current plan has me both starting and ending in 2025… but that may change. I’m pumped to finally have the excuse I need to do some cool stuff outside my data comfort zone. Also I’m pumped to put into practice my much more highly refined notetaking and general productivity capabilities. Going back to school with actual _questions_ and **implicit desire to learn specific things** will be sweet. Now I am learning for the sake of _doing_, not learning for the sake of someday having a job.

# Coming Site Changes

In anticipation of my free time quickly going away again, I’ve been inspired to do another thing that’s been on my list:

**Someday I’ll rebuild my website**

This website as it has existed for the past 5 years as a fork of a pre-existing blog template hosted using the Jekyll blogging framework. Jekyll is written in Ruby. I don’t know Ruby. Clearly this _works_, but I’ve always had quibbles and annoyances with it, and I can’t _fix_ them easily cause I can’t get under the hood. My next blog will be NodeJS+TypeScript-based, and will enable me to do my writing in [Obsidian](https://gillespedia.com/Obsidian). Obsidian has really started to become my go-to app for nearly everything.

### Ramifications

This is my last intended post on _this_ version of the website. I’m planning to migrate all my posts and do some surgery on things. This may take time. Things will look different soon.

# Art.

Art is going to be more prominent in my life.

**Someday I’ll get another tattoo**

I’ve never regretted getting my first one. I’ve wanted to get another for the past 15 years. For the past 5 years _what_ that will be has been stable. It’s happening.

# Art Part 2

Most importantly of all, I finally executed on a long-held desire to draw a particular thing.

**Someday I’ll draw that thing I keep picturing**

That day was today.

![[457-1.png]]

I drew the giraffe doing curls because I’ve never seen a giraffe curl before, and to be honest with you, I wanted to see a giraffe curl.

The Jacked Giraffe (let’s call him Jack) is my new spirit animal[2](https://aarongilly.com/457/#fn:2).

…also, no, that’s not the tattoo.

# Top 5: Things that are My Jam

## 5. Ice

I recently started using ice in my water at home. Game changer. I carry a giant insulated bottle around, and now the contents of said bottle are literally ice cold. Makes drinking way more refreshing. If “water” sounds boring to you, “ice cold water” can help. Ice is my jam.

## 4. Exercise

75 Hard has us doing 2-a-day exercise. That’s overkill in the long run, but I’ll be honest it sort of rocks. I’m never far away from the endorphin rush that comes from moving my body. I’ve been pretty dedicated to exercise for well over a decade now. I can truly say it’s my jam.

## 3. Geocaching

We have recently picked up geocaching. It’s essentially just treasure hunting. Puzzles and hiking and stuff. It’s my jam.

## 2. The Bullet Journal Method (book)

I’m re-reading the book “The Bullet Journal Method”. Even though **I have no bullet journal** annd _essentially_ don’t do the “BuJo” system - I couldn’t recommend reading this book more. It’s 100% my jam. If I weren’t so digital-first, I’d **absolutely** be the guy who carries around a book and writes all the time.

## 1. Walking

It turns out walking is **definitely** my jam. I like to take 2-to-4 mile walks around my neighborhood, ideally NOT partaking in any form of content from my phone while doing it. I struggled deeply for years to incorporate any form of cardiovascular training into my fitness regiment. It turns out once I lowered the bar for what constituted cardio I realized the bar wasn’t actually that low, and I was successfully clearing it all the time, rather than never actually making it over the high bar (i.e. going out to do sprints). Long walks are perhaps going to be the best thing that happened from 75 Hard.

# Motto: (Windows) 8 million form factors

Today, I write you two columns. A Windows flavor (here) and a Google flavor (above). This is the Windows 8 edition.

Last Thursday (Friday? I don’t remember and am too lazy to Google it) Microsoft held its formal keynote, unleashing Windows 8 unto the world. Today, they did much the same with their new mobile version of Windows: Windows Phone 8.
Windows broke off everything they were doing with the release of Windows 8. It’s entirely different than any of their previous offerings. This is neither explicitly good nor explicitly bad. I have had no face-time with an actual Windows 8 phone or computer, so take this review with a grain of salt. 

I am intrigued, but pessimistic about all of Microsoft’s newly announced products.

Windows 8 without a touchscreen seems entirely dumb. Considering something like 99% of laptops out there right now don’t run touch screens, your upgrade to Windows 8 had better be with a new device. Having said that, there is no one clear-cut way to make a good touchscreen laptop/tablet hybrid. You have the Asus Transformer-like removable keyboard. The sliding keyboard. The rotating display one. The rotating display two. The double-display. And, of course, the plain old laptop (but with a touchscreen). It will be interesting to see which of these form factors the consumers grab onto the most. Microsoft Surface and other Windows RT-running tablets are likely going to be more expensive than the current Android and Apple offerings. They also come with the risk of the whole ecosystem stagnating and ending up sucking. This is what happened when Blackberry released the Storm. Also the Torch. Also the Playbook. Also Blackberry 10 (okay, that hasn’t happened yet it will be released and it will flop). 
Microsoft is the current king of business solutions. I am worried for them that in their attempts to reach out and become a major contender in the mobile and tablet industries again they will lose-focus and stagnate on the business front. Microsoft does business and productivity well. The “Modern UI Style” Windows 8, from what I can tell, is a step away from “productivity” in any sense of the word.
I wish I had a month to test out Microsoft’s ecosystem. Actually, that reminds me of my answer to “what would I do if I had a year and a (practically) unlimited amount of money”. I’ll write about that… sometime.

(message from the future: this picture is lost to time, but Windows 8 was garbage)
Windows 8 Desktop/Tablet OS

(message from the future: this picture is lost to time, but Windows Phone 8 was even more garbage)
Windows Phone 8 OS
All tablets are now bigger brothers of their mobile counterparts.

# Top 5: Areas Windows 8 might come out on top
5. The Modern UI Style (Metro) and the live tiles. I think they look somewhat lame, but they might be more compelling on my own personal phone.
4. Complete and total collapse of every other option. Always a possibility.
3. Form Factor. The market is flooded with different laptops and desktops and all-in-ones offering Microsoft's latest OS. Apple usually has 1 iMax and 2 to 3 Macbooks available at any given time. Google Chrome OS is so rare I've only ever seen one person using it in the wild.
2. Camera and photos. The phones right now lined up for debut with Windows Phone 8 all seem to have much better than average cameras. Also, WP8 integrates with Facebook some? That will make for greater appreciate by the sheeple.
1. Support for Microsoft Office. Sadly, it's in Microsoft's best interest now to never create a good Office client for either Android or iOS.

I promise to cover at least *one* fun thing in amongst all this seriousness.

# Ankylosing Spondylitis

In [Column #312](https://aarongilly.com/312) I talked about having a disease. Not the kind you get by not taking care of yourself, but the kind you just sorta... get. At the time the best I could say was that I had "*undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy*", which isn't so much a disease of itself as it is a family of related conditions. My diagnosis wasn't "officially" specified beyond that back then. Now it is.

I have Ankylosing Spondylitis. I have for years.

Ankylosing Spondylitis is an incurable, progressively debilitating autoimmune disease that's both not well understood and way more common than you'd expect[^1]. It primarily affects the joints of the spine, especially where the spine meets the hips and the ribs, but it is commonly associated with other arthritic/autoimmune disorders involving the skin, hands/knees/feet, eyes, and bowels. Like many autoimmune diseases, problems come and go at seemingly random intervals. When you experience a flare, you don't know if you're in for days, weeks, months, or years, nor do you know whether the pain will be mild or severe. You're just along for the ride, hoping your body will be good to you again soon. 

Thankfully, my case had been relatively inactive for most of the past 11 years (since my first flare). I've had relatively few flares or ancillary issues popping up here or there. I've spent roughly half of the past dozen years not on any medications and living a completely normal, active life.

## What Have You Done for Me Lately?

The past four months, though, have not been good to me. A flare hit right when my second child was born and has been here ever since. It started in my hips, but has settled down into the joints of my feet and, to a lesser extent, my knees. My feet are swollen. Walking is painful, so I hobble like an old man. If it were possible to have a double-limp, I would. My life has been a struggle of balancing treatments with parenting an infant & a 2 year old and dealing with some additional responsibilities at my job. That's how these things work, though. It's particularly cruel that flares tend to happen when you're already stressed. 

![pill organizer](assets/406-1.jpg)

I'm already eating about as healthy as one can possibly eat & exercising 3+ times/week. I'm already on prescription-strength NSAIDs. Yet the problems persist. So I've taken another step towards the most aggressive treatment known to modern medicine. We'll see how it plays out. If I'm lucky I can avoid regularly injecting myself with [the 2nd most expensive drug on the market](https://www.goodrx.com/blog/top-10-most-expensive-popular-brand-name-drugs-us-how-to-save/). In the meantime, I'm just taking life one day at a time. Doing my best to appreciate the countless blessings I do have rather than focusing on the few curses.

## Imagine Dragons Segue

Not-so-fun fact: ankylosing spondylitis is what [the song "Believer" by Imagine Dragons](https://youtu.be/7wtfhZwyrcc) is about. In [an interview with People Magazine](https://people.com/music/imagine-dragons-dan-reynolds-believer-ankylosing-spondylitis/) the lead singer said something that I resonate with:

> "A.S. requires you to live a more disciplined life" - Dan Reynolds, frontman of Imagine Dragons

That leads me pretty neatly into my next major topic.

# Personal Data Warehouse

I have a naming problem. 

I have a qualified-self ledger/journal that I've been iterating on since 2013. Originally I called it "The Life Tracker", which might be the least creative, most cringey name. Truthfully I didn't like it even back then. As I wrote about in [Column #385](http://aarongilly.com/385), it took me 6.8 years to think of a better name: "data journal"... but lately I've been calling it something else.

I have a Personal Data Warehouse (PDW).

Or, I should say, I have Data Journal that I am working to turn *into* a Personal Data Warehouse.

What is a "Data Warehouse"? Well, without going into *full* nerd territory, a data warehouse is just a common location that stores copies of data generated elsewhere in an organized way. This allows you to continue to get data where its generated, but also have a single source against which you can build queries/reports/dashboards. If you prefer definitions from Wikipedia: 

> Central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse)

## Backpedaling Column #405

In [my last post](http://aarongilly.com/405/) I talked about having started version 10 of my Life Tracking "Data Journal" via Google Sheets and the Google Apps Script. I started. Then I stopped. I saw a squirrel. The squirrel you were just introduced to. Version 10 of the Life Tracker is (probably) still going to happen. I want to create a *good* version of a Google-Sheets based PDW, but it's not my first goal.

## Aaron API

To make a PDW, I want something that isn't so closely-bound to any underlying platform. See my Top 5 for possible implementation stacks, but what's needed is an associated "Aaron API"[^2]. I have dedicated a lot of time lately to thinking about the generic functions that would need to exist and specifying the interfaces between them.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cA7MyqUcMfsQ5JRF3G3S3Ttlosk79qUqyoC2jvLm3d7OcKA_PSXPe1hm6GDZ5CKZoEx-SYguThEdU5oe6Z_6wgsCNjcS9xXlum7luSfDInVbiZACuInnPTWkqbR4Iq4qK8uBurrij0ou-SqAYYzxB44A=w500" alt="">
  <figcaption>Work In Progress.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The goal here is to define the rules of the game, that way I can substitute which technologies/hosts/languages are playing and retain a functional system. This allows me to update the data model and views built upon those data independent of one-another. If the boundaries of the controller are well-defined, a neat little dashboard I build can be migrated between a SQLite-based Django app and a MongoDB-based Node.js app with essentially no refactoring.

Moreover, as additional options become available (LOOKING AT YOU, [NOTION API](https://www.notion.so/api-beta), I'll be able to read from or write to them in a controlled manner.

## Connection Between the Two Main Topics

I have an interest in keeping track of everything in my life because I have a disease that causes life-altering pain which comes and goes seemingly at random. If there's any hope to find some sort of "trigger", I need to keep track of what I was doing right before a flare happened. Because if I want to maximize the number of good, mostly healthy years I get to spend with my family, I need to be more diligent than the average person. Also because I've seen Google Image results for people who didn't have Ankylosing Spondylitis well-managed, and that's not something I'm willing to accidentally slip into.

Like Dan Reynolds says: Anklosing Spondylitis takes more discipline. 

# Other Topics!

Fun was promised.

## WandaVision

The first (and, presumably, *only*) season of WandaVision is wrapping up in less than a week as of this writing. It's been somewhat divisive show, surprisingly. Unsurprisingly, I have **loved** the show thus far. It's the perfect balance of mystery, fun, lore-expansion, and style. Speaking of style - the original music composed for the show is the best thing that's happened musically to the MCU. Period. Check it out:

[![spotify image](assets/406-2.jpg)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/703lzaoCk8pghOEwrwMGtU)

Note: that playlist does contain one spoiler for anyone who hasn't sent he show up to this point yet. If you're clicking that link and you haven't seen the show yet... who are you? Why are you the way you are?

## We Scene a Movie Merch

![store](assets/406-3.jpg)

I made [a merch storefront](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/19502422-wsam-transparent-logo) for [the podcast I co-host](https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co) using TeePublic. This is both an advertisement for my podcast's merch and also an endorsement of [TeePublic](https://www.teepublic.com) for spare-time creatives like myself. I was genuinely shocked by how crazy easy/fast it was to establish an account and upload art[^3] and make it available for purchase on a wide array of reasonably-priced products. 

![sticker](assets/406-4.jpg)

I bought four WSaM stickers and got them to my door for less than $12. My "artist's" account was credited $2 for those $12. Pretty neat!

## Quick Thing I Noticed

When it comes to standards for 16x9 monitor/television resolutions - we skipped a generation when we went 4k. 

720p ⇒ 1280 x 720 ... 1280 + 720 = **2000**

1080p ⇒ 1920 x 1080 ... 1920 + 1080 = **3000**

1440p ⇒ 2560 x 1440 ... 2560 + 1440 = **4000**

4k ⇒ 3840 x 2160 ... 3840 + 2160 = **6000**

What happened to the 16x9 resolution that adds up to 5000?

It turns out there's a little known, little used resolution called "3K", also known as "QHD+". That's 3200x1800 ... 3200 + 1800 = **5000**. I wonder why it got skipped.

## Notes

My Notion-based [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) continues to be a rewarding thing I do. [It's publicly accessible here](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea). I recently finished reading "Flow". Which made for the 40th book broken down into atomic pieces and linked together as part of my growing body of notes. The 584 notes in there cover topics from productivity to health & fitness to society to data science and a bunch more. 

Sometime this year I'm going to make a point to blitzkrieg those notes & turn them into a series of [Gillespedia](http://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/) articles.  


# Top 5: Stacks for Implementing My PDW & "Aaron API"


## 5. [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) + [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet)

Google Apps Script web hosting, "main" UI, & logic. Google Sheets as both a data store & optional additional UI. I've had 9 versions of this combination in the past. Version 10 is still on my radar, although not as immediate as it seemed in my last post.


## 4. [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) + [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

Google Apps Script web hosting, UI, & logic. A Firebase Persistent Datastore as a basic database.


## 3. [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com) + [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

What I'm actively using today.


## 2. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) + DynamoDB/Redshift/Aurora/Neptune/Timestream

In other words: just AWS. They've got all sorts of different databases-as-a-service products. I didn't even name them all right there.


## 1. Local [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) + [Python](https://www.python.org) + [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html)

This is my newest, most exciting idea. I realized that I didn't want to be dependent on *any* cloud-service provider in the long-term. So I'm actively working toward building a local python-based application using SQLite. This would serve more as a backup to whatever cloud-based solutions I'm rocking at any given moment... but also an enduring physically-accessible version of my data. Bonus points that it teaches me to use Python and SQL, both of which I'm 100% confident I can pick up and use and 100% ashamed that I've never *really* used before. 


# **Quote:**

[^1]: Depending on the study you trust and/or what populations you want to consider, it's somewhere between 1 in 15000 or as many as 1 in 1000 get the disease. Not everyone is equally affected, there is no "test" for AS, and this makes reliable diagnoses and population studies difficult. 

[^2]: I recognize "Aaron API" is *also* an uncreative, cringeworthy name. I wonder what I'll call it in 7 years.

[^3]: "Art", lol.

# Motto: I need to lift more.

This post is being written almost entirely to share a video I just made. You can find this video down below, in the Top 5. 

Some pretext to the video:
I worked from my place today. It's the snowpocalypse outside and I had computer work I could do all day, so I decided it was appropriate. At 9pm I realized I hadn't left my place all day. I looked outside and saw a big bank of fresh snow and knew what I had to do.

Before the Top 5, though, I have two things to talk about.

KU beat Iowa State in overtime. I watched this with my three buddies I often watch games with. It was maybe the second best comeback I've ever seen (nothing will ever top 2008's National Championship game). There were some questionable and some downright wrong calls... but those can go either way - and I'll take a win, regardless.

The other thing -

Microsoft started putting out negative ads against Gmail. They warn that Google is going through every word of your personal email, just looking for ways to exploit that personal information to bombard you with advertisements!

In actuality Google does check the content of your email for some possible keywords - but it's not like they have a team of people reading your stuff. As it goes through, a machine looks for a pre-defined set of words. This goes on for a few reasons. First off, yes, it might help them deliver more relevant advertisements to you as a person; but it ALSO allows them to stop you from sending an email containing the phrase "I have attached" without an attachment. It is what allows Google Now on your phone to track the packages you get emailed about, or the status of flights or hotels you're scheduled for. All of these things, even the targeted advertising, is good for the consumer - the person who chooses to use this free service they are offering. 

Now, you still say, I CRY FOUL! NO! I CANNOT HAVE THIS! What MICROSOFT doesn't tell you, though, is that Outlook.com (the solution they are offering to the Gmail "problem") uses your searches from Bing in the exact same manner. So, really, pick your poison really.

Beyond all those details, the advertisements are really reaaally cheesy, annoying, and dumb. The fact that Microsoft has stooped so low as to run attack ads (something that, up until now, was limited to politicians - the lowliest of advertisers) speaks in volumes about the products they are putting out and how desperate they have become. You know who doesn't need attack ads? Google. Apple. Anybody who's actually put out an innovative product worth buying in the past 12 months.

Pack it in, Microsoft, it's already over.

One more thing on targeted advertising -
I have long said I'd rather have an advertisement that's relevant to what I care about than one for tampons. There is no practical way to get around someone using your person information online to target ads to you. Facebook, for example, exists for this sole purpose. IF you are really concerned about privacy, do what I did - limit your personal information to one party. One source. One point of failure. No loose strings lying around. This could be Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or even Yahoo - just please... don't do Yahoo.

Other than that, this column is and was entirely about the video below. It's 1 minute and 52 seconds long. Is it worth 2 minutes of your day? God I hope so.

Next Day Lunchtime Edit:
Forgot a picture - so here's a clipping from the below video -

# Motto: Take Me Out to of the Ballgame

I'm writing this post in lieu of going out to play laser tag.

I know what you're thinking, "Aaron, that's not very 'Yes Man' of you." Alternatively "why would anyone skip out on laser tag ever?!" And both thoughts are equally valid. 

I took part in a VERY SHORT NOTICE basketball tournament this weekend. I asked AJ what he was doing this weekend, he said something to the affect of "Leaving for a basketball tournament in 10 minutes, want to go?"

I went.

On the way there AJ said it was a bunch of guys who used to play basketball in college. I didn't know this fact when I signed on board. When I walked into the gymnasium and saw our competition, I wanted to leave immediately. They were big. They were fast. They were naturals. 

It was terrifying.

We played our first game and managed to squeak out a win by one. 

Then we played the guys who won the game I saw when I first walked in. I had a bit of a sinking feeling walking onto the court, but then I won the tip against a guy I thought was going to out-jump me for sure. Then our team made something like 6 three-pointers in a row. And we never really looked back. We end up beating the scariest team by 11 or 13.

The last team was more like us. 6 older, slower dudes. Long story short, we beat them again to win the whole tournament and a t-shirt.

![](assets/95-1.jpg)

I wish this said "Champion" or "This guy won something" or "Basketball person"
I only scored 4 or 6 points per game, but I didn't think I played that bad. Usually with that score I would go home with a foul taste in my mouth, but I am also not used to being the worst player on the floor. That was the case at several points during the tournament. My job was to defend, rebound, and that was most of what I did. 

It was awesome.

But anyway, I'm very tired now. Which is why I'm passing up laser tag.

One random thing before I go into the Royal's games thing - I played in a trivia night with 3 different groups of great friends. It was really strange having people that I know so well and like so much meet each other. Sort of a preview of the wedding, I guess.

Over the span of 2 weeks I watched 3 Royal's games. Here are pictures from those times:

Tailgating from the first game with Nick, Leigh, Kyle, and Stephanie

Game two with Joe and Jon

![fun fact, the only person in these three photos who didnt' have his girlfriend there is the onl one who's still with her today](assets/95-4.png)
Game three with Kyle, Priya, AJ, Danielle, Aaron, and fictionally Melissa

I don't particularly like baseball, so I'm not sure how I ended up going to so many games in such a short amount of time. I mostly just wanted to post that last picture on here.

Motto: Let's Get It Started In Here  
  
Our baby is going to be induced two days from now. Tomorrow we go in for pre-induction medical magic. That means basically everything I do right now I'm doing for the last time as an individual without any children. This is the last Column I will write as a non-father. This is the last time I'll write the word "ambidextrous". This is the last time I'll go on a nice little Sunday outing. It makes everything seem arbitrarily important. Every thought is good enough to write about. Every little thing is worthy of savor. That's probably why I'm on a hot streak of Column writing.  
  
Next time I write something in here, I'll have to start each of my opinions with "_As a father..._"   
  
Melissa says I should proof read these Columns before I actually post them. She's noticed a number of times where I start somet  
  
It's amazing how much the weather affects everything and everybody. If it's a nice day I am almost invariably in a good mood. Everything seems right in the world. There's no problem that's too serious and no issue that's difficult to overcome. People are nicer. The world seems to be created by some divine & all-powerful creator that loves us. I look at herbs growing in the garden and think about how wonderful it is this little complex life form has grown just so that it can be enjoyed and grown anew. It's designed and tailored to enrich the human experience. A slightly overcast, a bit of breeze, mid-70's day has the capability to really put me into a good mood. I wonder if you'd still get that feeling if you lived in a place where it's nice all the time. Do people in California just walk around all day with a positive outlook? Do people in Hawaii think that life is a beautiful gift?  
  
Right here right now it's muggy as hell. Everything sucks.  
  
Nah it's alright. But I do wish I could walk out my front door and go on a hike. I wish I could swim in the ocean... nevermind the fact I suck at swimming. I think I'd have a good reason to learn competence if my only experience with the water wasn't 6' deep pools and a trip to the lake every now and then. But it's garbage outside 8 months out of the year. So you take up hobbies like drawing, coding, reading, watching movies, or lifting weights. If life gives you lemons, you make lemonade... despite the fact you'd _probably_ prefer a nice strawberry smoothie or something. Just be grateful you've got lemons in the first place.  
  
I'm a farmer sitting on his porch watching a storm roll in... it looks like a doozy, but we've been needing rain anyway.

Motto: I wrote this on a laptop

  
I've been interested in consumer technology since I reached my teenage years. That interest has never waned, and I've done tons of thinking about the subject. I have come up with a new thought experiment that I'd like to do with you guys - "What is each type of consumer tech good for, and what combinations make the most sense together?" I'm going to list what each piece of tech is and what it does. Most of this might be obvious, so if it looks boring you can just skip until you see me listing combinations. That should be more interesting. **What pieces of consumer electronics are available and what are they good for?** **Desktop Computer**   

[![](assets/199-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lct7SE2gwSg/VAkIlwk0LSI/AAAAAAABccw/3jJnA-54aSo/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BDesktop.jpg)

Desktops computers are the most powerful, most flexible thing on this list. Desktops are the best when it comes to photo & video editing, powerhouse gaming, computer programming, insane multitasking, and anything else that's processor-intensive. It would be possible to do anything you want to do and to do it better and cheaper with a desktop computer. You just can't move it anywhere. **Laptop Computer/ultrabooks** 

[![](assets/199-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c%5FsjRCg7vKs/VAkIyqUV%5FxI/AAAAAAABcc4/7vDgE-fiV7s/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BLaptop.jpg)

Laptop computers are the second most powerful thing on this list. A high-octane laptop can be every bit as powerful as a medium-to-high level desktop. The problem is the price. I've done some research, a laptop computer will generally be 50% more expensive than a desktop computer with similar specifications. Laptops are the only option for portability with no compromises. **Chromebooks/cheap laptops** 

[![](assets/199-3.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LMxQsNyGcus/VAkI8OZMgbI/AAAAAAABcdA/-LaeIxr0jzA/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BChromebook.png)

Cheap laptops (either Chromebooks or really low-powered Windows machines) aren't good for anything beyond web browsing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. In fact, that's the beauty of the Chromebook. If you are going to go this route, I highly suggest going with a Chromebook. If your hope is to play games, write code, do heavy multitasking, and/or edit photos, videos, or music, I really don't recommend anything in this category, Chromebook or not. **"Large" Tablet** 

[![](assets/199-4.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yJo6RjuFrrM/VAkKRlaCIBI/AAAAAAABcdY/L2mtIY5C50Y/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BLarge%2BTablet.jpg)

I'm calling any tablet over 8 inches "large". The iPad is a "large" tablet. They blend portability and productivity and skew towards the portability side of things. Tablets of this size are surprisingly powerful devices, though. Given specific situations, they could be everybit as useful as any of the above when it comes to getting things done. It's common to see full-blown physical keyboards attached to tablets of this size, turning them into some sort of a quasi-laptop. **"Small" Tablet** 

[![](assets/199-5.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jv7A-x3PjiA/VAkKe9J1QOI/AAAAAAABcdg/qFEWsr8-hy4/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BSmall%2BTablet.JPG)

Tablets sized at 8 inches or less are what I'd call "small" or "personal" tablets. The iPad Mini is a "small" tablet. These guys fill a special niche as content consumption devices. They fit just about anywhere you want to put them and provide surprisingly decent user experience for watching Netflix, playing lightweight games, or browsing the internet. For a couple of years this was my favorite type of device on this list. However, their limited screen realestate make them much less useful for doing anything productive. You probably won't see a physical keyboard attached to any of these in the wild; and if you do, it will look silly. Small tablets clash with the next item up for review. **Phablet** 

[![](assets/199-6.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIw9IoFr2mU/VAkKl-QLfGI/AAAAAAABcdo/rYMfPU6o0t0/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BPhablet.jpg)

Just like the difference between "large" and "small" tablets, there is no official, universally accepted cutoff between a phablet and a phone. Personally I'd stick the cutoff point at around 5.5 inches. Anything at 5.5 inches or above really becomes unfeasabile for one-handed operation. People who use phablets generally swear by them. Their large screen realestate makes for a more compelling user experience than you'd find on their smaller brethern. This comes at the expense of massive pocket bulges when you aren't using the device. I've never owned a phablet, but that's more becuase there's never been one that runs stock Android. You usually find phablets with crappy OEM software to make use of the stylus that most phablets will come with. If you have a phablet, you might have a hard time finding a usage case for a small tablet. The day I got a phone with a 5 inch 1080p display I basically quit using the 7 inch Nexus 7... and I don't even consider 5 inches "phablet" territory. **Phone** 

[![](assets/199-7.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DjR2oSyB55Y/VAkKtmCLjWI/AAAAAAABcdw/XzAVuFNlj80/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BPhone.jpg)

Phones. We all have them. They've completely changed how everything in the world works in less than 10 years. The day you get your first smartphone is the day you are no longer ever lost, uninformed, unable to take pictures, record video or audio. Phones are the ultimate "personal computer" and they are by far the most interesting thing that's happened in the realm of consumer electronics since the first consumer-targeted desktops came about. Of all the devices on this list, a phone is probably the most important, probably the one you use more often than any others, and probably the best thing on this list. In developing countries a person's phone is likely their only computer. As I wrote about in [Column #168](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/04/168-wedding-at-end-of-tunnel.html), a phone isn't just a phone. It's a mobile internet device, pedometer, flashlight, still camera, video camera, mp3 player, mp4 player, stopwatch, alarm clock, GPS navigation system, portable wifi hotspot, electronic level, scientific calculator, instrument tuner, radio, audio recorder, electronic library, electronic notebook, personal digital assistant, game boy, barometer, USB memory stick, and a portable television. I left off that list electronic book, dictionary/thesaurus/encyclopedia/anything else from the internet, mirror, pager, and... oh yeah... phone. **Wearable** 

[![](assets/199-8.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o-LvLqJFdm8/VAkK%5Fd%5Fk5iI/AAAAAAABcd4/1p3dfKSbVoI/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BWearable.jpg)

"Wearable" is a generic term for a piece of computing tech that you wear on your body. More often than not wearables take the form or a watch, but they could also be warn on the head, neck, or really just about anywhere. The most exciting wearable platform available today is Android Wear... but there's a solid chance that Apple will announce their wearable device in less than a week and change this. Wearables are most often used for instant notifications and "the quanified self", but they may have other uses now or in the future. Wearables are meant to augment other consumer tech. You generally wouldn't own ONLY a smartwatch, or something. That'd be weird. **e-Readers** 

[![](assets/199-9.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xbyc%5FI-lNZ0/VAkLJG1zbGI/AAAAAAABceA/dbfxWYkCJGw/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BeReader.jpg)

Books with batteries. An entire library in the small pocket on your backpack. Some with days' worth of battery life. Some with sophisticated applications and computer-like features. E-readers are content consumptions devices that specialize in written content. **MP3 Players** 

[![](assets/199-10.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-35BhDYfGZgg/VAkLQwEMHzI/AAAAAAABceI/iAgO%5FtmygFY/s1600/%23199%2B-%2Bmp3%2Bplayer.jpg)

From the iPod shuffle to the iPod Touch, MP3 players are devices whose primary purpose may or may not be to serve music up directly into your ears. **Video Game Consoles** 

[![](assets/199-11.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qt0yeTns14A/VAkLZUjkZ5I/AAAAAAABceQ/CQtI21Z75nU/s1600/%23199%2B-%2Bgame%2Bconsole.jpg)

All video game consoles are essentially just highly specialized desktop computers. Notice I didn't say "highly powerful", as the most powerful of all gaming devices will never be the consoles that are specifically dedicated to do just that. Video game consoles are media consumption devices that you use from 10 feet away. They try to be media streamers and digital libraries, but I think more often than not they are just used to play games with. **TV Streaming Boxes** 

[![](assets/199-12.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-75LEwLX7sfA/VAkLnIVlGiI/AAAAAAABceY/OUMp4ETW9Ew/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BTV%2BStreamer.jpg)

From the Roku to the Chromecast to Apple TV and Amazon's Fire TV, TV streaming sticks are all about getting content from the internet or your computer onto your TV. They might offer some lightweight gaming functionality, but generally are used for binge watching Orange is the New Black. On a related note, I'm very much looking forward to Android TV. **Cameras and Video Cameras** 

[![](assets/199-13.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h%5FOUB427S%5FI/VAkL4WQL54I/AAAAAAABceg/KYqn5EwOl4I/s1600/%23199%2B-%2BCamera.jpg)

I'm including these for a sense of pseudocompleteness. Cameras and videocameras are like larger, highly specialized phones. Say that sentence 10 years ago and you'd sound crazy. All of the above is probably stuff you already knew. I'm sorry if it was boring. Now is the part where I get to editorialize and have some fun. **What combinations of the above items make the most sense for different people in different situations?** **You: Kid** 

[![](assets/199-14.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HRI5Dtob4Cw/VAkMU72YXaI/AAAAAAABceo/mFpspPqvaww/s1600/2%2Bdipeipe.jpg)

Tech Setup: Small tablet, probably ruggedized in some fashion. Alternate: None. Just, none. You aren't creating content. You have nothing "productive" to do. You are small, so using something small is probably ideal. A phone might be overkill (phones usually mean monthly costs to keep an active connection). As a side note: I'm not a fan of seeing kids in resturants playing on iPads. **You: High schooler** 

[![](assets/199-15.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0V4NfAinrbQ/VAkNBER-PLI/AAAAAAABce4/%5FvaWMc3a6cI/s1600/MagazineGroup.jpg)

Tech setup: Phone, borrowed computer, possibly video game console and/or tablet Alternate: Phone, desktop You can drive! Good for you! You probably should keep an active connection to the internet. You probably need access to a computer, but probably not often enough to warrant the expense of a dedicated machine (either laptop or desktop). You may or may not have a video game console or a tablet. I could also imagine another possibility where you DO have a computer, it lives at home and acts as your gaming machine on which you also do some homework. **You: College student** 

[![](assets/199-16.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IIUAiHwu8yw/VAkNgjjc3FI/AAAAAAABcfA/QoUXUl5r4Ec/s1600/IMG%5F20120512%5F074301.jpg)

Tech setup: Phone, Laptop, possibly e-Reader, video game console Alternate: Phone, Chromebook, Desktop You have actual homework and access to a computer is pretty much required. You need portability so you can work in the library. Your two potable computing options are a full-blown laptop that you use as your only computer or a Chromebook that you use to take notes on, write papers on, or, if needed, remote into your desktop at home. Also, obviously, you'll need a phone because snapchat and Clash of Clans. **You: Working adult** 

[![](assets/199-17.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-82IAcPZHW%5F4/VAkke3fnWBI/AAAAAAABcfU/K7WVlBtvmEE/s1600/IMG%5F20130111%5F101900.jpg)

Tech setup: Phone, Tablet, Laptop Alternate: Phone, Tablet, Desktop Alternate: Phablet, Laptop Alternate: Phone, Chromebook, Desktop Probably addition: TV Streaming Box You are the basic computer user. You have occasional needs for sophisticated programs running outside of the browser, be it video editing, photo editing, videogaming, or something else. You most often find yourself doing light internet browsing using your secondary computing device. Maybe relaxing on the couch with an iPad while the TV plays for background noise. This is probably the most common setup there is. **You: Working adult without the need for any specialty programs** 

[![](assets/199-18.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KJEQkXZTEk0/VAkk5NC9kbI/AAAAAAABcfc/eu-HwumqT0c/s1600/Sep%2B4%2C%2B2014%2B9%3A50%3A05%2BPM.jpg)

Tech setup: Phone Alternate: Phone, tablet Alternate: Phone, Chromebook What you need to do can be done online. Furthermore, it can be done fairly easily from your phone. You may want to supplement your phone with something with a bigger screen and perhaps a hardware keyboard, but you definitely don't need a machine that's capable of running Diablo or Final Cut Pro. Those things are for new age hippies anyway. **You: Rich Nerd** 

[![](assets/199-19.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bdZPYqZNgmE/VAkoHdcWhXI/AAAAAAABcfo/HGLWsfWnVzg/s1600/Sep%2B4%2C%2B2014%2B10%3A03%3A51%2BPM.jpg)

Tech setup: Phone, Game Console, Tablet Small, Tablet Large, Laptop, Chromebook, Desktop, 2 wearables, and up to 3 TV streaming boxes Alternate: More crap You want it all. Even though you've got an iPhone , MacBook Pro, iPad, iPad Mini, iMac, a fitbit, an older fitbit that no longer works, 2 Apple TVs, and a Wii U, you are probably going to go ahead and get the iWatch or whatever they call it when it comes out. You're going to get it because you CAN and that's the way things work. **Bonus round: What it would be like living with ONLY one device**  
Desktop: You'd be able to do anything you want... so long as you didn't leave that desk.  
Laptop: You'd be able to do anything you want... so long as you're near an outlet because you've worn your battery out.   
Chromebook: You'd be able to email and browse the internet like the best of us. You'd aslo be able to listen to music, watch videos, and still do most things. You'd have a harder time finding a way to use it to make phonecalls than you would with a full-blown computer.   
Large tablet: You could make this work... but it would be wonky.   
Small tablet: You could make this work, and it would be less wonky... but you'd have a hard time getting anything productive done.   
Phablet: You'd be slightly better off than the "only have a phone" guys.   
Phone: You'd only have a phone... but let's face it, that's still amazing and way better than having a phone, computer, camera, etc from 15 years ago.   
Wearable: You'd be weird.   
Game Console: You'd be 7 years old.  
  
Notice how MP3 players don't show up anywhere on any of these lists? That's because they are going extinct.

  
Top 5: Tech Predictions

5\. The cell phone will always be the most important, most "personal" of any of piece of consumer tech. It will be the central hub of your communications and will probably take on new roles in the future, both in the developing and developed worlds. 4\. Wearables will become more mainstream and will behave as an extension of your phone, not as a replacement to it. 3\. We will see a unification of devices. MP3 players will die out. The line between gaming consoles and TV streaming boxes will blur. All phones will have similar specs, similar User Interfaces, and similar looks. These predictions are easy - because they've pretty much already happened. 2\. Sometime the United States will figure out a system to make my cellphone into my wallet (for credit cards, loyalty cards, AND identification cards). My pockets will celebrate. 1\. Android will turn humans into _actual_ Androids

Motto: Let the Chips Fall Where They May  
  
I have ecosystem anxiety.   
  
A long time ago, I jumped into the Google ecosystem with both feet. I even went so far as to install Linux instead of Windows on my main computer. After a year or so, though, I decided my new desktop should run a Windows OS. For this one thing, I decided, I couldn't "Go Google". When Google Plus first came out, I thought "YES! FINALLY! I can ditch Facebook!" Eventually it became clear that nobody I know wanted to use or care in the least about Google Plus. The Amazon Echo came out and I thought "Google will have a competitor to this someday," so I waited and was eventually one of the first buyers of the Google Home.  
  
On Amazon's "Prime Day" I picked up a $35 Echo Dot, just to see what the other side of the fence was like. I gotta say, I like this little thing. Makes me think about how Google's had this Google Home out for 9+ months and I can't even use it to ring my Google smartphone or add items to the Google-based shopping list I actually used. Then I started thinking about all the products they've killed off. Google Reader I used. Google Glass I did not, and thank God cause it's basically dead as far as its development for the regular consumer. Then there' Google Hangouts - the one messaging platform that I was successful in getting most of the people I talk with to get on... and it's largely fallen by the wayside. I'm certainly not going to jump to "Allo". That whole thing makes me look at iMessage and say "ahh man...."  
  
I bought into the GoPro ecosystem really hard, but they took a weird turn a while back where they wanted you to upload all your stuff to their cloud and pay them an ongoing fee. The other week I saw a DJI Phantom drone and thought "this is so much cooler than anything I could ever do with a GoPro". I sold off one of my two cameras, and my remaining one is reaching End of Life in terms of software support. Their new ones look sick, but history has forced me to hesitate more than I previously would.  
  
I just want stuff to fulfill all the functions I want fulfilled, and I wanted that stuff to all play nicely with one another. I guess no one company can be the best at all the things. There's no a solution to my problem, other than just deciding it isn't a problem anymore.  
  
I like things to be neat, organized, and consistent, but my life and my preferences evolve over time. I wish I had a dozen journals that were all the same that were full of my writing over the years. I wish I had one continuous blog that dated back to when I first started. I wish the account on my computer and the account on my phone were the same account.  
  
Then again, I wish I had the same workout I'd been doing for years. I wish my daily routine were so finely tuned that I had complete control over every minute of every day. Maybe I'm moving onto a different issue altogether, though. My engineer brain is chanting "optimize. optimize. optimize." underneath my normal internal monologue.  
  
On a semi-related note - I had a bit of a thought experiment come to me the other day. The gist of it was to boil down all business with which you interact to a core set. To weed out which things were superfluous and to decide "if I were to have a simpler life, these are things I'm sure I'd want in it."  
  
To be a little more specific, the idea was "who would I pick if I could only have economic transactions with 10 businesses". I stipulated that hospitals, healthcare, and insurances shouldn't count, but everything else was fair game. Subsequently I've decided that banks shouldn't be on the list either. Also no circumventing the exercise by going to a place for Gift Cards and using those, or picking Amazon, who's really just a middle man for you to get to other businesses. For my list, see my Top ~~5~~ 10.  
  
I'm thinking about all this because that's what I"m doing tonight. Thinking. I've already worked out. It's storming outside. I just finished all the Rick and Morty episodes I have access to. I don't have a book I'm reading. I don't feel like drawing, or really writing any more, for that matter - so now I'm just... considering.  
  
How should I change my workout plan?  
How should I change my diet?  
What should the song for this year's "Second-a-Day" video be?  
Should I do anything new with next year's video?  
What should I do tomorrow?

Top 10: Places I'd Choose if I Could Only Spend Money at 5 Businesses  
10\. Royal Caribbean - cruises are a one-stop-shop for vacations, in my (limited) experience, Royal Caribbean is an awesome cruise line, and you can cruise from the Americas to Europe and Asia.  
9\. Sheels - they tend to carry clothes in my size (sometimes), and I get the bonus "they sell all sorts of sports stuff" too.  
8\. Hendricks car dealerships - they sell cars, the fix cars. Now all I need is gas.  
7\. QuikTrip - pretty widespread and among the nicer gas station franchises.  
6\. Chipotle - all over, always delicious  
5\. Taco Bell - I hate to include a second burrito place on here, but I love burritos and sometimes I want them handed to me through my car window.  
4\. Texas Roadhouse - a widespread, quality, non-burrito place to get food.  
3\. Target - for anything not covered elsewhere on this list  
2\. Home Depot - cause I want to be able to buy wood and stuff  
1\. CostCo - for everything from food to furniture

Motto: I found a **homogeneous mixture composed of only one phase**  

  
Figured it out.

  
I wrote a 2385 word Column last week about notetaking software and how it sucks. Everything I said was valid and true, but I figured it out.

  
I am going back to grad school (hopefully in 12 months) to study Computer Science. My degree was in Electrical Engineering, which is _tangentially related_ to Computer Science, but is _not_ Computer Science. I have some ground to make up before I have hopes to succeed in a masters-level computer science program. So I've been taking classes and doing independent research online. 

  
During these classes/research I've been taking handwritten notes. After writing my last Column, I decided to experiment with OneNote as my main notetaking platform. Long story short:

Clearly, electronic notes aren't "faster" given my style of notetaking... and, as I mentioned in the last Column, physically writing notes has been shown to translate to better retention of the information. That's two bonuses for physical notes.

  
But what about the digital, searchable archive? Well, it turns out Melissa and I bought a scanner a while back that's really good at handling just that. I've been digitizing my notebooks from college. Finished Circuits 2 and 3 since I started this Column. So it's going pretty fast. The scanner creates searchable PDFs at a rate of about 12 second per page, which is really not bad. 

  
So now I have a .PDF that's titled "Circuits 3" that's 84 pages long, searches seem to work _alright_ \- but that's way better than I had before. From now on, I will have my notes with me anywhere there's an internet connection... also in this handy dandy notebook:

 (and one other just like it)

  
Top 5: Benefits of My New Notetaking System

5\. It makes notes as portable and as shareable as I want  
4\. It's both local & cloud-based... and within the Google ecosystem (into which I've already fully bought)  
3\. It supports encryption on a per-note basis (although encryption reduces the number of places I can see my notes)  
2\. It justifies the purchase of our fancy scanner, which was admittedly a 'luxury' buy at the time  
1\. It allows me to apply my forward-looking notetaking system retroactively (I'm half done already)  

  
Quote:

"Seriously?"

\- Melissa, after she found out I was worrying about notetaking systems again (she was very supportive after that, though) -

Motto: Gentleman on the Streets, Freak in the Spreadsheets

  
The Life Tracker.

  
It was never given a better name - but it started with a _worse_ name. If you don't believe me you can read what I wrote about my new "Life Tracking System (LTS)" in [Column #83](http://www.aarongilly.com/83). That was five years ago - meaning I've been doing this thing for five years now.

  
If you don't choose to read Column #83 (I don't blame you) - you should know that reading it now made me proud of what I've accomplished here. I set out to track my life, I defined what that meant to me - and really I did a **damn** good job of it. My original goals have only shifted _slightly_ in the past 1827 days.   
  
Originally, I intended to track:

1\. Diet

2\. Exercise

3\. Money

4\. Daily Goals [(which I stole from Demetri Martin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qkkQIzQ4VI)

5\. What I did each day (high level list of events)  
  
Looking at that list now, it's a pretty good cross-section of the things that are important in life. Especially when you consider I haven't had to change 24 of the 25 Daily Goals I set up when I was fresh out of college - they're still relevant now that I'm five+ years into my career.  
  
That's what I set out to do... and that's what I achieved. I failed on exactly zero of those ambitions. In addition - I found a way to include my weight, sleep, health, happiness, location, steps taken, calories burned, some specific tags for any given day, and finally the weather (cause why not) all while requiring _less_ daily maintenance than it did when I started. Nearly half the data today just come in automatically. The spreadsheet has 105 columns, **92,665** individual data points. Here come a ton of graphics.  
  
Below - basic averages, data by day-of-week, data over time by month, data over time by year, then the pinnacle findings.  
  
To make the simple data more interesting I'm going to use cutesy data visualizations:

I had a brainstorm during the writing of this Column. This whole thing was an exercise in correlations... but rather than guessing at which correlations would be meaningful, why not just check ALL of them?  
  
[![](assets/339-25.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-%5F5qMJ49fCFA/WvZqM96KDnI/AAAAAAAC-Zs/4eUbnepH8PA2AcxFUoCRNwr15080E0U5ACLcBGAs/s1600/%2523339%2B-%2BCorrelations%2BMinus%2BPerfect%2BOnes.PNG)

  
[For a better view of these correlations, this whole sentence is a link to a copy of that sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14VlwDM2RKpTpiijtwnvocSZxvvZGS6zKhWGbwseqhOs/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
Alright - that's all I'm going to write for now. It's time to move on.  
  
So - I've been saying for years that my plan was to roll the Life Tracker up into some sort of distributable Android Application - and truthfully I still might - but I've realized over the past half year that a spreadsheet really is the best way to house this data. Writing an app has proven tedious and annoying and most of the effort I've put into it is just towards recreating what's native to spreadsheet applications. The ultimate product I'd make wouldn't be more capable than the thing I've already made unless I quit my job and dedicated a year of my life to make it so... and that's just not worth it. Not right now.  
  
So then - do I stop? Do I say "good job, me!" and pack it in? Or do I keep going as is?  
I'm not stopping - but I'm also not going to keep going this hard. I'll figure it out.

  
Top 5: Unplanned Benefits of The Life Tracker

5\. Synergy with my 30 Day Challenge project ([which I stole from Matt Cutts](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt%5Fcutts%5Ftry%5Fsomething%5Fnew%5Ffor%5F30%5Fdays).  
4\. Synergy with my [Second-A-Day Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8%5FAwZQKjplc&list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw) project ([which I stole from an artist named Madeline](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/this-is-what-madeline-did-video-2011%5Fn%5F1210813.html).  
3\. Helped with doctor's appointments, taxes, and dozens of "when was it that I did \_\_\_\_" situations. I hadn't really thought about how it would help with that stuff.  
2\. It's kept me honest with myself about things its not fun to be honest with yourself about. This probably wasn't "unplanned", but whatever.  
1\. The tools and techniques I forced myself to learn to build it have become invaluable in my career. The work I put into this project gave me the confidence and capability to make real impacts to the business.

  
Actual Quote:

"It's a good reminder though, especially now when it feels like the world is crumbling and life is just happening at us. We forget that we all have the capability and the possibility and the skillset and the tools to create the future we want. The future doesn't just show up fully formed, you know, we are creating it in the present, but we have to be willing to make some short-term sacrifices for long-term gain - and that's the challenge. The challenge is that we tend to think in the now, in the United States and we think in the now and short-shift ourselves in the future. So I think it's a great idea for us all to be optimistic about the world that we're creating but we have to put the wheels in motion to make that optimistic future happen."

Motto: Baskin Robbins always finds out  
  
I spent a couple of nights in Albuquerque earlier this week. It was my first time (in memory) down around that state. Technically, I think I saw a bit of New Mexico when my parents took us down to the Grand Canyon - but that was too long ago for me to remember much. Anyway, New Mexico was cool. The food was _great_. There were colorful signs everywhere. There were no clouds in the sky. There was no humidity in the air. The whole city ranged from really nice and fancy to really _not_ those things.  
  
I was there for business, but did get a chance to go [The National Museum of Nuclear Science and History](http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/see/exhibits/). It was super cool seeing all that stuff. Learning about the history of nuclear science, the race to the atomic bomb, the Manhattan project, WW2, the Cold War, and our more modern day stuff, was all extremely cool and interesting. Having said all that, I think the most interesting picture I took that day was this one:

I'm fairly confident that I the young lady holding up that "war over" newspaper has **got** to be somewhere up (down?) my family tree. I recognized the similarity to my mom's side of the family _immediately_. My sisters did the same, although my parents took some convincing.  
  
In other cool news - it's surprisingly nice out. I got to take out Krista's crazy awesome Christmas gift to Melissa and I and get some air time. Melissa learned to fly it, I learned how to fly it a little more confidently, and we got this cool photo:

That was from Instagram. That's why it's got the heavy filter. Yes I have an Instagram.  
  
I'm watching Ant Man. It's great. I'm at the train scene, it's truly one of my favorite scenes from any movie ever. While this movie isn't perfect (all movies have their flaws), it's extremely entertaining.  
  
Also, initial reactions to Marvel's Captain America: Civil War are in, and they are [overwhelmingly positive](http://screencrush.com/captain-america-civil-war-marvel-testing/), which makes me overwhelmingly excited.  

  
Uh, well, uh, OK. Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it

But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is:

  
I.  
HATE.  
SAUERKRAUT.  
  
Top 5: Collections I Keep  
5\. Quantified self data  
4\. Thoughts & pictures (this blog, Instagrams)  
3\. Waterbottles of various sorts (used to just be Nalgenes, but that's expanded lately)  
2\. Marvel TV shows  
1\. Marvel movies

Motto: You can probably just stop reading here, too.  
  
Today is day 30 of our Whole30.  
  
If you don't know about Whole30, it can be summarized pretty simply as a (fad) elimination diet in which you do not consume added sugars, grains, dairy, and legumes for a full 30 days. The idea being foods from these groups may be affecting your health in your day-to-day life, and you may not even realize it. By removing these items for 30 days your body can get used to not having them and you can see how that feels. Then you may begin re-introducing foods from these categories slowly, to see how those foods affect you.  
  
The sales pitch for the diet says it may help with:  
* Cutting cravings
* Consistently high energy levels
* Better sleep
* Better focus
* Being "strangely happy" (their words, not mine)
* Potentially abating symptoms of all sorts of medical conditions (allergies, headaches, joint pains, GI troubles, and lots of other stuff)
Whole30 is like a 30 Day Cleanse, except instead of eating only green smoothies, you only eat fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, oils, and spices. I was interested in it from an experimental perspective. My wife was too. So we made the commitment.  
  
That was 30 days ago. Here's what Whole30 has been for us:  
  
**Aaron:**  
To start, I'll say I'm glad I did Whole30\. I learned a lot and saw benefits I was not expecting... though it wasn't exclusively a good experience.  
  
I did NOT, however, see as _many_ life-changing benefits as I hoped. Specifically I didn't see changes to my joint health, nor any (positive) changes to my gastrointestinal system. To be fair - lately my back has been pretty healthy anyway, so there was limited room for noticeable improvements in that regard... but it's equally fair to say that my GI system got _worse_. Without going into the details, it's enough to say that trips from the bathroom went from "okay" to "less okay". This effect was worse a couple weeks in, but is still present here on day 30.  
  
I DID lose \~10 pounds in those 30 days, which is crazy because I didn't feel like I had much to lose to begin with. Also I noticed a change in how food tasted. I had a cache of mixed nuts at my desk at work for a year that I never touched because they tasted like salty blandness. Three weeks into the Whole30, I noticed these same nuts started to taste like sweet deliciousness. I noticed that my standard 2PM crash at work wasn't really happening any more.  
  
The best part of this whole thing has been expanding my horizons, food-wise. I'm eating and enjoying things I have always avoided for no good reason. I'm 100% out of the "what meat + boxed something combination are we eating tonight?" rut. That's incredibly liberating. It makes me very happy.  
  
I look forward to tomorrow, but I don't expect to suddenly change everything about how I've been eating. I'll add in some grains every once in a while. I'll add in protein powder... but I'm not going to suddenly go get Taco Bell.  
  
**Melissa - guest blogger:**  
Yay! I feel special to be a guest! Unfortunately for you, readers and Aaron, I don't know how to be concise with words. Here is my Whole30 experience: A few months ago, after years of experiencing undiagnosed joint pains and constant postnatal discomfort, I found myself hopping from doctor to doctor and becoming hopeless and depressed that I couldn't feel better. Eventually, I noticed that both a physical therapist and nurse practitioner had mentioned to me that I should try out Whole30 and/or read Melissa Hartwig's book about nutrition. At that time, I was not exercising (and honestly hadn't to speak of for a few years) and was eating meals that were mostly combinations of meat + boxed pasta. Maybe the occasional microwavable veggies and canned fruit. I never went to the "healthy" section of the grocery store... honestly, because it made me feel anxious with a feeling of \*I know I need to eat this way but I don't know how so I guess I'll just keep doing what I'm doing until I'm motivated enough to look into this.\* When you don't understand half of the ingredients (tapioca? ghee? arrowroot? kimchi?), it makes it hard to justify the extra cost and time trying to understand what you're looking at. You feel stupid and like you're being duped. But at the same time, our comfortable and regular diet truly felt like a tasty but unhealthy "rut." I just thought of a visual metaphor that makes sense to me. Let's picture a bowling ball that has curved into the gutter. Slim chance it's going to jump out of the gutter once it's there. It's going to take a LOT of energy from a spin throw-- but sometimes it happens! And then it's back on track the rest of the lane until- Pow! Spare! Ok.. cheesy.. but hey, it's how I feel: I MADE IT out of the gutter this time!!! I finally listened to those doctors \[insert cheesy motivation about being a mom now and being responsible for another human\] and asked Aaron if he would support me trying Whole30\. I had no idea he would go all in, too! I decided to be very intentional about taking care of myself in every way by going cold turkey into a new diet, exercise, and self-care routine. Here is what happened:  
  
I started with some research. I listened to "It Starts with Food" and watched Marie Kondo's Netflix series. I bought a Whole30 recipe book at Costco. I learned about the Beachbody On Demand app and decided on a fitness plan. Aaron helped by pushing me to pick a start day and we were coming up on the first of the month. After looking in my cabinets, I decided we would have to either throw everything out OR delay our start until we ate through them like the very hungry caterpillar. We went with the latter and had a horrible two weeks of carbs, more carbs, and nearly-expired unmentionable junk food. We MAY have packed on a few extra pounds beforehand. I flipped through my "Whole30: Fast and Easy" cookbook and jotted down a list of ingredients that we would need to acquire to make a core set of first foods. That first trip to Whole Foods was EXPENSIVE, but I felt so good about setting us up for success. Once our cabinets and fridge were cleared out & refilled with the foreign ingredients-- so much coconut-- we were set. Cooking was hard and time-intensive, but EVERY SINGLE recipe we tried was beyond amazing. I started noticing tons of changes. Many beyond what Aaron experienced, but I also started out at a less healthy point. Keep in mind that I was also starting a new intensive exercise routine- but here is what I noticed:  
  
\- Amazing, glowing skin  
\- A lack of belly pain that I didn't even realize I had daily until it was gone  
\- ZERO days with joint pain  
\- Energy and excitement to exercise  
\- Fullness from smaller plates  
\- Disinterest in foods I would have slammed before (jelly beans, goldfish, popcorn, etc.)  
\- Pride in what I was feeding my son, rather than worry that he was getting junk food vicariously through his milk  
\- Pleasant digestion  
\- Metabolism changes (I notice it mostly as night sweats)  
\- Cooking takes forever, but it's less of a "chore" and more of family time  
\- Expanded palate-- I truly can't believe how much I'm loving veggies I used to "hate"  
\- I'm becoming a label ninja- looking & being selective, rather than refusing to even peek  
\- Less anxiety... and tons of related positive effects!  
\- Hope that I can keep going; this was more than just 'doable'- I loved the whole month!  
  
All-in-all, I feel amazing. I can't stop raving about it. I love the feeling so much that we're planning on trying a modified paleo afterward. I'm guessing I have always had some level of intolerance to gluten or dairy or sugar. I never, ever thought I would be able to accomplish a restriction of one of those, let alone ALL 3! I've never done a "diet" before (even though you're not supposed to call whole30 a diet), so I didn't know I could have success. Cold turkey was definitely the way to go. Combining it with daily exercise when I was getting none before was SO hard, but I probably had more success in each because of the combo. I quickly lost around 10 pounds, so I'm down 10 from before pregnancy. YES! I think I would have lost more, but I saw a lot of muscle gain. It felt like food became my FUEL for exercise... rather than just hoping my food wouldn't make me feel too bloated to exercise. My "after" pictures don't reflect a ton of change yet, but I don't even care. I am 100% more confident in my body and see the changes in the mirror. I used to say I could never have abs- I just wasn't built that way- but I see baby abs! Each day, I feel so motivated by the changes I see from my hard work the day before. So would I recommend Whole30? ABSOLUTELY. I feel like I was the least likely-to-succeed person who ever tried it, and here I am afterward planning my next 30 days to be basically more of the same. So from one Melissa to another (Melissa Hartwig, co-founder of the Whole30 program)-- thank you! This has truly changed my life.\* And thank you, Aaron, for being my partner on this journey.

Top 5: Tips if You're Thinking about Doing a Whole30  
5\. Expect to spend more money on food than usual. Expect to spend WAY more time and energy on food than usual. This can be a good thing, though.  
4\. Don't start a Whole30 if you are planning on going out of town. It is difficult and expensive to try to eat out & stay in compliance. Your options are limited and generally worse than the food you'd make yourself.  
3\. Buy (or check out from the library) a Whole30 recipe book. Make food from that. If you rely on stuff you already know how to make, you're robbing yourself of half of the learning experience.  
2\. Read a bunch of recipes from the book, make a list of common ingredients they call for, then go stock up on those ingredients. One of the benefits of eating only whole foods is that you find a lot of commonality between ingredient lists.  
1\. Purge your stock of non-compliant foods before you start. If you're staring an unopened bag of Oreos in the face; you're gonna have a bad time.

Motto: Vegas is Paying Out Big Money to Some to Some Lucky Betters

  
This weekend I built a computer. Let me answer some anticipated questions: **Q: Why did you need a new computer?**A: This is a great question. The best, most truthful answer I can give is that I didn't need a new computer... yet. My Linux-running laptop does achieve the bare minimum functionality I needed it to. It was, however, incapable of many things - and the things it was capable of doing almost always had an asterisks next to them. It was capable of browsing the internet.\* It was capable of editing video.\*\* It was capable of watching video.\*\*\* It was capable of playing games.\*\*\*\* It was capable of transcoding video.\*\*\*\*\* \*except for sites using flash, quicktime, or silverlight - or some other sites that would just sometimes not work without explanation. \*\*with a video editor I never "liked" only tolerated, with many limitations. \*\*\*so long as that video was 24 or 30 frames per second with a low bitrate. \*\*\*\*limited to: majong tiles, solitaire, and minesweeper. \*\*\*\*\*slooooowly. It was incapable of variable bitrate video editing or playback. It was incapable of being host to a remote client. It was incapable of running Google Drive. It was incapable of being considered a "master computer" for Melissa and I to use going into the future - on account of the abnormal OS, lack of internal storage, and lack of computational throughput. **Q: But I thought you loved your Linux laptop?**A: I did, and in a way I still do. Every piece of software on that computer was free and legal, and it met most of my needs. Getting it to where it was was a huge effort, and it was a source of pride. **Q: Aren't you trying to buy a house soon? Why did you buy a computer?**A: Upon doing further research into our budgets and the true costs of buying a home, Melissa and I determined it wasn't really possible to buy a house before our current lease is up. This delays the house buying process and allows us to build capital. Long story short, "buying a house" seemed like the grown-up thing to do, when really the grown-up thing to do is probably to continue to rent until we are sure we can afford what we want. **Q: Okay, so what is so great about this new computer?**A: Well, first and foremost I built it. It took me over a quarter-century, but I finally built a computer from its piece parts. I did the research, made the inquiries, made the purchases, learned the process, executed on the build, and only messed up one time... when I "fixed" what I thought was a minor mistake but it later turned out it wasn't right the first way. The now fully-assembled and working machine is easily the most powerful computer I've ever used. More importantly, it's a great "master computer" for Melissa and I to use for master backups, heavy computational tasks, and media serving. It's also nice that it runs Windows 8.1 **Q: Wait, what? Windows 8.1? Aren't you Mr. "Windows is awful. I hate Windows with the intensity of 100 suns!"?**A: Yeah, that's me. It's truly depressing, but going back to Windows was really my best option. The way I saw it, I had 3 options: 1\. Buy an iMac desktop. Pay a TON of money to get a moderately capable system. When that system starts to slow down, pay for another entirely new computer. 2\. Build a computer, put Linux on it. Pay a smaller amount of money for much more capable hardware, but continue to deal with software woes, unoptimized systems, and an OS not easily navigated by anyone other than me. 3\. Build a computer, put Windows on it. Deal with Windows 8\. Reap all benefits. Swallow pride. Option #3 was really the only option. Windows 8 is not great. It's not terrible, either... especially since I put "classic start" on here. It looks and works almost exactly like Windows 7\. Plus, I've made the conscious decision NOT to install Microsoft Office. That can be me "stick it to Microsoft" that I stand on. **Q: Why not put Windows 7 on there?**A: Windows 7 will have a shorter support life. Windows 8 is more efficient in terms of processor use. Plus there's still the rumor that Windows 10 might be a free upgrade for anyone running Windows 8.1, and I'd like to have that option. That is all. This is what my computer looks like: [![](assets/228-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AmCJ4KWo0OQ/VLnjuCSAk%5FI/AAAAAAABlbw/tl4h3rhJhoU/s1600/IMG%5F20150111%5F152056.jpg)

  
Top 5: **Things I'm Excited to do with My Computer** 5\. Let me edit video in an editor I actively like using. 4\. Let me edit that video from my Chromebook by remoting into my main PC. 3\. Give me a massive, huge internal RAID storage for source video content. 2\. Upgrade it in the future without buying a whole new computer. 1\. Play games more complex than Freecell. Spoiler alert - I did so last night and my entire next post you can probably skip on account of that.

**Warning**: whining ensuing shortly by a person who isn't actively dying. 

# My Belief in Balance

Somewhere along the way I adopted the belief that life inevitably has ups and downs, and they more or less offset. If you go through a happy time, you will then go through a sad time of equal-yet-opposite intensity & duration. If you have a collection of really great events, then you're more prone to going through some sort of antithetical streak of suckiness. Life ends up looking like a big sine wave of peaks and valleys.

I had a thought in mid-2020 I was in for a rough time at some point in the future. During the beginning phases of the pandemic my life was absolutely ***humming***. I was working from home for the first time thanks to the pandemic. I was learning successfully to code. I was in the best shape of my life. My son was at a very fun age and we learned we had another on the way. I had several months of pretty much uninterrupted bliss; and I genuinely thought "this has all been so great, I'm in for it soon".

I can now confidently say that I've experienced the equivalent valley from that peak. 

## Perspective

I really try to keep perspective. My life is easy. See [#154](http://aarongilly.com/154)[^1]. Since that time I've got a few new things to add to that list of things people would gladly point out and say “you've got it so easy, bro”.

- I am straight and cisgendered. It didn't even _cross my mind_ to mention this in 2014 - that's how privileged I am.  My wife and I look like what everyone's grandma thinks of when they think _“gee they're such a cute couple”_.
- I'm still very happily married to a wonderful woman after 8 great years.
- I have two sons that were born more or less healthy and without any special needs that we are aware of. While they have had seemingly more than their fair share of minor illnesses, they haven't yet had to return to the hospital since they were born.
- I have yet to experience any profound loss in life.
- I'm a homeowner and job-haver with an incredibly in-demand skillset.
- We recently bought a Tesla. So again everything below is bullshit.

...but holy crap I've been stuck in a cold streak for a **LONG** time now.

# Thus Begins the Suck

My youngest child doesn't sleep through the night. I don't mean like “he usually wakes us up”, I mean in his >2 year life we have gotten an uninterrupted 8 hours of sleep on fewer than 5 occasions. I was cool with that when he was a baby and it was expected, but I didn't expect to still be having a child kicking me in the back every night. 

This ties into another one of my beliefs: without proper sleep, everything is harder.

This by itself I wouldn't bother writing about. But the lack of good sleep plays into everything below. 

## Begin Sob Story

I have had Anklosing Spondylitis for 13 years. Flare ups are not dependable in any way. If you wake up and your joints are particularly stiff and painful, you have no idea if that's just a bad _day_ or if it's going to become the start of a months-long trend.

Luckily I've built and maintained a whole ridiculous system for tracking various aspects of my life. Its thanks to the PDW[^2] that I can pinpoint **6/28/2022** as the beginning of this long-running streak of garbage luck. 

6/28 - begin flare up.

### July

My back is unsteady. Most days are bad, but sometimes I have a random not-so-bad day.

7/19 - gum grafting, right side. Begin liquid-only diet & no exercise.

### August

8/2 - grafting healed, back is seemingly maybe doing a bit better?

8/4 - just kidding, but back is still bad, and more depressingly I'm feeling pain in **lots of new joints that have never before been issues**. My knuckles, knees, and the little interstitial joints in my feet, they all hurt pretty much all the time.

8/14 - back is now the worst it's ever been. There is no escape from pain. Laying in painful. Sitting. Standing. Walking. Everything.

~8/22 my back began **spasming**, which is a new issue I've never experienced before. It came from me holding everything tense trying to protect my spine for so long. This translates to breathtakingly sharp and sudden fits of pain that happen seemingly at random.

### September

The spasms stopped, but otherwise more of the same. Around this time I couldn't put my shoes on because that required me to lean forward, which wasn't possible. I developed a method of putting on shoes that could be done by leaning more "sideways" than forward.

### October

**Begin the illnesses.**

10/4 - 10/6 - 2 Year Old home sick 

10/7 - I put $12k into the basement, and in doing so went from having a finished basement to having an unfinished basement.

10/11 I got a cold and our 4 year old had something that kept him out of school

10/19 - Gum grafting part 2, the other side of my mouth. Back to a liquid diet, back to no exercise - which isn't new. I haven't been able to exercise really since July.

10/24 - 2 Year Old Pink Eye

### November

11/1 - 11/6 - both boys come down with fevers the day after Halloween, this lasts for 4 1/2 days

11/8 - the boys are healthy and I took my first ever dose of Humira. A symbol of the end of the streak of bad things… or so I thought.

11/9 - I take a day of vacation for R&R because I'm not feeling great, but also not so sick that working would be impossible. Hope it's just a 24 hour thing.

11/10 - 11/15 it's not. I'm much much worse. I am now on my 3rd straight day of bed rest. These things only ever happen during the weekend. I've run multiple dozens of fevers over the past few days. Come ON DUDE.

11/16 - I'm out of the woods... so far as I know.

## TL;DR -

Since late June I've had my worst flare up, two oral surgeries, sick kids, some very un-fun home expenses, and now just when I thought everything was going to be better I got the sickest I've been in yeaaars.

# Motto: “That which goes up, must also come down” is a wildly inaccurate statement.

About the motto: first off, “up” and “down” are dependent upon your frame of reference, but even if that wasn’t the case; there are jillions of examples of things that go up without coming down. Deep space probes. All the various equipment we left on the Moon. The Moon itself was likely part of the earth at one time, it went up. Pixar made the movie “Up”. I don’t see them making the movie “Down” at any point in time. Most buildings and satellites that are currently “up” won’t be coming down at any point in our lifetime. A more accurate saying would be “That which goes up, is quite likely to come down”. Perhaps, to keep the meaning of the saying, it should be “If you are happy or in power or in any other way emotionally lifted you should probably enjoy it, because it’s not happening for forever.”

Keep the tradition of that which goes up, must also come down: Microsoft. I read a looong article last night about how they are slowly circling the drain. In a way, it made me happy. I’m likely going to live to see a major regime change take place. The way things have been is not going to be the way things will be. Change is good.

Change, actually, sucks. Pennies are now more costly to manufacture than the value they hold [citation needed]. Nickels and dimes don’t carry enough monetary oomph to continue carrying around. Coinstars are the saving grace for change, and they take a cut of your money as a processing fee. Physical money is wildly inconvenient in most modern-day official circumstances. The only thing I use physical money for are Turnpike fees and buying those Girl Scout cookies the other day.

The more I follow tech news (and news in general) the more I think of big corporations as little children on the playground, fighting over their turf. One such example: when Apple’s iPhone 4 first came out, it had an antenna issue. If you held the phone in a certain way, the signal died. What was their response? They had a public demonstration of how you could do the same thing with some other phones made by other manufactures. It was very much a “Well I saw Timmy doing the same thing last week!” way of getting out of trouble. They eventually admitted their fault and offered a $15 compensation for those affected, if you took the necessary steps. Google screwed up the Nexus 4 launch from any logical person’s perspective - and they haven’t so much as said a word. I used to employ this technique in relationships all the time. If I screwed up, I wouldn’t admit fault or talk about it and I would wait for the issue to go away by itself. I’ve long since realized this method doesn’t really work. Samsung and Apple are having an all-out “he’s copying me” “no I’m not, he is!” war. Same could be said with Apple and most other companies. They are being particularly prissy about the whole ordeal. Long story short, corporate America… grow up.

Lately I’ve been slacking off with my whole “life betterment” deal. I lost my little running daily checklist last week. That, in turn, made me lose my focus and drive. I had a baaad week in terms of being “healthy”. My place got disorganized. I didn’t work out much (at all). I didn’t learn or practice anything useful. I didn’t use time effectively (at all). But, on the upside, I DID manage to keep a few things going… I saw my family and talked with friends. I wrote some. I drank water. I kept my video-a-day project going.

My posts have all been monstrously long as of late. So I’m going to end this one now.

# Motto: Upping the Entertainment Value for My Lovely Audience

As per usual. I have all of the rest of this column done already (the motto, top 5, and quote are all already filled out), but I am stuck with writer's block for the main body. Go figure.

July 7th my little big sister got married to a big goofball. How big? Almost as tall as me... but with another 20 to 30 pounds of meat distributed throughout mostly his upper body. How goofy? He makes me look like Larry King (Larry King was the most serious person I could think of off the top of my head). I was an usher in their wedding. I ushed. The wedding ceremony was good. Very weddingy. Next came the party bus... complete with more booze than 14 people should drink in a night and a time limit to drink it all before we got to the reception. I didn't help meet the goal (I still can't drink, doctor's orders). A party bus full of drunken people isn't the most fun place for a sober fellow, but it was a good enough time nonetheless. The reception, however, was grand. I had a blast. It was the most fun I've had in a long time. The Top 5 below recounts my favorite moments from the reception.

The entire night was awesome. The wedding, the party bus, the reception, the entire rest of the night... it was all great. I would be so lucky to have that much fun at my own wedding, whenever that ends up being. 

I'm going to leave this post off with a set of pictures:

# Top 5: Memories from the Reception
5. Amy and James's first dance, which abruptly went from a slow dance to a 5 minute first dance extravaganza, venturing across many songs over many genres. 
4. Catching the garter. I out-stretched every single bachelor in the place and nabbed me the "next to get married" signifier. Signifier apparently isn't a word. I'm making it one.
3. Mingling with everyone at the reception... which I did quite successfully. Especially given the whole "I didn't drink" thing.
2. Dancing. From the dramatic dance-in entry of each of the pairs in the wedding party, to attempting to shuffle, to Jon and Sally's silly dances, to learning the Cupid Slide, to slow dancing with the bridesmaids. I did really well considering the "I didn't drink" thing.
1. Jon and Sally's jumping back and forth dance together. It was the most perfect blending of two personalities into one wildly appropriate action I've ever seen. It made my list of "perfect moments" in my life.

# Motto: Just a Normal Day at the Office (Chair)

Even though my life has not been full of extravagant adventures to Thailand since the last update, even though there haven't been any amazing and life-changing events, once-in-a-lifetime experiences, or any other sort of fantastical happenings... I've gotta say things have been going really well! The best part is, I largely have myself to thank for all of this - I have paddled my own boat. I have the kind of happiness that can only be produced in-house. I have done and been exactly the things I want to do and be. I have, for the time being, been truly self-actualized. I've never really been able to say that before.

![](assets/81-1.jpg)

This has been my life lately

I guess the awesome vacation and the awesome news about my awesome fiance hasn't really hurt things, either. But I do take a large amount of credit for not coming back home and just moping about. I've picked right back up where I left off with achieving my goals.

Plus I have a lot I'm looking forward to (see my Top 5). 

Sunday I sat down at my desk chair at ~3-4pm to work on my Life Tracking project that I wrote about at the end of Column #77. Before I knew it, it was dinner time. I put some chicken from a box in the oven. It took 3 minutes, but I was very annoyed by the interruption. Same story 14 to 16 minutes later when the food was done and I had to go through the painstaking trouble of putting it on a plate for consumption. Next thing I knew it was midnight and I had finished.

All the basic, core functionality is built out. It all works great. Better than I even imagined before starting the project. I've added some cool things I didn't even think about until I started actually building the thing. I'll write more about it in 6 days, after I finish my first full week of Life Tracking. You'll get to see some nifty screenshots about what I did this week.

On a related note: I went to Taco Bell today. I literally gasped when I saw the numbers I had to put into my tracker. Turns out unhealthy food is unhealthy.

The Life Tracker is an intentional step towards better achieving my long-standing goal of being healthy. I set out to be "the best physical shape" I've ever been in before I went to Thailand. I think I came fairly close to achieving that goal, depending upon how you measure it. I'm re-upping this goal for when Melissa comes home. Then again for the wedding.

THEN I can get fat.

But I digress. There are two more things I want to talk about before I wrap up:

1. Thailand and California were both AWESOME vacations... I realized, though, that they were MOSTLY awesome because I knew the right people. I had the connections. I got special treatment (private tours, free meal, etc) on both trips. I guess what I'm saying is you gotta know the right people... and if you do; appreciate it, yo.

2. I ran across my favorite somewhat obscure internet phrase today: "Ninja Edit". A ninja edit is an edit made to a post directly after it gets posted. I like the imagery of a ninja very quickly and with great martial art skill pulling up a post he just made to change one or two things about it. Almost all of my proof-reading takes place via ninja edits. Sometimes I don't do them at all, though, so nothing gets proofread. If you find an error, that's wye.

This sentence was added via a ninja edit. If you got to the column in time to see it without this sentence, I'm flattered (and apologize for the wacky formatting Blogger felt like "correcting" for me).

Double ninja edit - Blogger has weird formatting issues sometimes. All the text after the picture is slightly too small. I can't make it normal size. All I can do is make it huge or leave as is.

# Top 5: Things I'm Looking Forward To
5. The next phase of the Life Tracking project
4. Starting my Movie Poster Project
3. The "next phase" of Marvel movies (I'm a comic book nerd born a generation too late for actual comic books)
2. Google I/O (next month)
1. Melissa's return (2 months & change)

# Motto: Don't eat an apple a day. Doctor visits are necessary.

Since my birthday (2 days ago) I've started doing 2 new things: 

First, I started writing in a "5 Year Journal". It has 365 pages. Each pages is separated into fifths. One fifth for each year. This way, you can see what you wrote the previous year(s) on your next go around. This is the first way I've added additional life documentation. This journal idea (and the journal) was given to me by Sally (who will come up later).

Second, I started taking a short video each day. At the end of this year of my life (my 25th birthday) I will compile all of these videos, trimmed down to one second each, into a single ~7 minute video. This idea, of course, is also not entirely original. There is a video that went viral a while back of a girl doing this same thing. It is called "This is What Madeline Did". I was thinking of calling it "My 24th Year". If you are just having a relaxing evening, the video that link goes to is not bad. I consider it to be worth a watch. Depending on where you buy the watch, that's probably between five and fifty dollars. This is the second way I've added additional life documentation.

When I have kids they are going to get to see all about who their dad was when he was younger. This is actually true of everyone since the advent of social networking. Think about that for a while.

I am now 99.99966% sure I am going to California. This makes my certainty 6 Sigma qualified. I have purchased the tickets and have spoken with my Californian contact, THE Sally Hanson (remember that name). She is being quite the generous host and offering to show me Los Angeles and the surrounding area. A specific itinerary have yet to be formulated. I'm sure you'll hear more about the plans as the come together.

In other news:

I'm moving out of this place sooner than expected; namely tomorrow.

Also - this just came in the mail:

Boom.

# Top 5: Strange Units of Measure
5. [The Smoot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot) - a unit of length equal to 5 feet, 7 inches
4. The Wheaton - a measurement of Twitter followers, relative to celebrity Wil Wheaton; later standardized to half a million followers.
3. MegaFonzie - a unit of coolness equal to 1 million Fonzies (coined in Futurama)
2. Beard-Second - a unit of length equal to the amount a standard beard grows in a second, 100 ansgtroms
1. Millihelen - a unit of beauty, in reference to Helen of Troy whose face was so beautiful it "launched a thousand ships". A single millihelen is the beauty required to launch one ship.

# The Philosophy

My favorite philosophy:

![[443-1.png]]

“Less, but better” is a recognition of the limits of our time, energy, and capacity. Its meaning is ambiguous, but intentionally so. All interpretations of the phrase are good. Here’s 3 ways to look at it.

## Do Less, but Do It Better

If you want to achieve the things you do at a high level, you can't be doing too many things. 

Chase two rabbits, lose them both. If you pursue your dream, you have a good chance of making it happen. If you chase ALL your dreams, you may find yourself getting nowhere[^1]. Do more by doing less, it's not a platitude, it's the truth. Pick a goal, pursue it relentlessly. Don't succumb to target confusion. 

## Have Less, but Have Better Stuff

In order to love the things you own, you can't own too much. Humans are born with the natural inclination to have a favorite shirt. You have one or two favorites, for sure. The question is, why do you have the shirts that definitely *aren't* your favorite? 

It's better to buy two $60 shirts that you absolutely love and it is to buy 12 $10 shirts that are just fine. 

Do the research. Get the good one. Once you have it, love it. Maintain it. Don't buy a glut of crap you hate fixing when it breaks down. Buy the good thing that you are happy to spend the time on to keep in good condition.

## Less *is* Better

Another interpretation of the phrase “less, but better” is that simply having (or doing) less **IS** better. That’s it. It's not that you spend an equivalent amount of resources but on fewer (but nicer) things/activities, it's just *having fewer things or activities*. We are wired to acquire things. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so, too, does your calendar - if you let it. Same could be said of the empty rooms you have in the house you just bought. 

The problem: our ancestors, the creatures we evolved from, never had the *capability* to worry about “too much”… now it’s trivially easy for anyone of even modest means in a developed country to find themselves over consuming, over indulging, and over extending themselves beyond what’s healthy or what would make them actually *happy*. You are often better off having less than you’d probably want. I think more often than not.

# Other Unrelated Stuff

## Values, Principles, and Methods

The terms “values” and “principles” can be nebulous. I think a good way to ground them is to consider them, along with “methods” as a hierarchy of increasingly concrete things.

Values are concepts.

Principles are general verb phrases.

Methods are specific actions that are examples of the principle in motion.

| Value      | Principle                                   | Methods                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Charity    | Give what you can to those who need it more | I will donate 25% of my bonuses and volunteer one day per quarter at XYZ shelter                                                                                                    |
| Simplicity | Do the simplest thing                       | I will favor plans with the fewest moving parts. I won't reinvent the wheel. I will apply the [Pareto Principle](https://gillespedia.com/Pareto%20Principle) rather than do it all. |

## Steep Learning Curve

Much like the term “high concept[^2]”, people use the term “steep learning curve” to mean the **opposite** of what it should literally mean. 

![[443-2.svg]]

If it takes forever to learn something, it would have a shallow learning curve. It takes a long time to climb. If it's steep, then that would mean you learn it quickly.

## Apple Software Updates

I like iOS 17. Shortcuts are faster now. Standby is unnecessary, but nice to have. Weirdly the improvements to the phone app may be my surprise favorite thing.

## Comparison

|  | Apples | Oranges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Category | Food | Food |
| Sub-category | Fruit | Fruit |
| Sub-sub-category | Round fruit | Round fruit |
| Sub-sub-sub-category | Palm-sized, round fruit | Palm-sized, round fruit |
| Price | ~$1 | ~$1 |
| Lifespan | ~week | ~week |
| Color | Red or Green, typically | Orange |

That wasn’t hard.



# Top 10: Topics that are Versions of “Less, but Better”

I recognize the irony of making a Top 5 about “Less, but Better” into a Top 10.



## 10. The Pomodoro Technique & Time Blocking

The Pomodoro Technique is when you choose a task to do, set a timer for ~20 minutes to an hour, start the timer, then perform dedicated work on that task until the timer finishes. Between each timer session take a few minutes to take a break. This is a specific implementation of the more generic concept of “Time Blocking” - setting aside specific a block time to work on a specific thing. When done properly - you’re preparing for the work before it starts, removing distractions, and focusing solely on the task at hand. It can be a great way to get things done.

Less time, spent better.



## 9. The Pareto Principle

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the outcome of a process/system are driven by 20% of its inputs and that by controlling *just* those inputs you can greatly affect the outcome with relatively little effort. The Pareto Principle can (and should) be applied to basically *every* system or process you want to improve. 

There are a **ton** of examples of the success of a rigorous and intentional application of the Pareto Principle, but my favorite is Costco. They don’t stock every possible option and permutation of the goods they carry. If you want olive oil, you MIGHT have two choices. They realized that 80% of the sales came from 20% of the products... so why have the other ones taking up shelf space that you could be using to sell other, unrelated high-performance goods?

Fewer products, highly vetted for better quality. Better profits and loyalty.



## 8. Frugal Models

When it comes to decision making, Daniel Kahneman suggests we are often better off using simple algorithms (with as little as 2 independent inputs) rather than our subjective opinion.

Expert judges who took into account dozens of factors and weighed them all in their heads did worse at predicting flight risk and risk of committing additional crimes than a simple decision algorithm that only took into account the age of the criminal and whether or not they have committed prior offenses. 

Fewer inputs. Better consistency of application. Better accuracy.



## 7. Checklists

According to Atul Gawande, the good checklist should have 5 to 9 items, fit on one page, and only cover the heavy hitters. Anything longer will wind up not getting used. 

Less text, better consistency. Better results.



## 6. YAGNI

For the 90%-100% of you who read this who don't code, the heading “YAGNI” isn't a typo, but instead an acronym for a coding principle I suck at.



👉 **YAGNI** = You're Not Gonna Need It.

Don't write code for “imagined” use cases or requirements. Write code to fulfill actual requirements when they show up. I ***suck*** at this. I think a 80% of the lines of code I've written over the past 4 months was eventually deemed unnecessary and deleted. 

Fewer features, better conceptual integrity. Better (faster) results.



## 5. Intermittent Fasting

I am not an expert in nutrition, but from what I’ve read one of the main mechanisms behind the purported benefits of intermittent fasting is simply that you end up eating *less*. When it comes to eating for most 1st-world people, less ****is**** better. Beyond that, though, your meal ***preparation*** also benefits. You’re preparing one fewer meals per day. You are less likely to get burnt out on cooking. You’ll cook better foods more often. Intermittent fasting is very much *less, but better*. 

Eating less often, but eating better.



## 4. One-bag Travel

People who travel infrequently carry armloads of bags through the airport, dropping stuff on the ground every time they hit some form of transition. People who travel a ***lot*** tend to pack the *same* thing (or darn close to it) every time. There’s a devoted fanbase of the concept of one-bag travel. This is bringing *less*, but better stuff with you when you go places. If you can get over the fear that you won’t have a thing you need for an imagined scenario, you can find yourself enjoying the moment a lot easier when you get there.

Carrying less, but more thought out stuff. Better travel experience.



## 3. “More wood behind fewer arrows”

Phrase I’ve heard before which is the essence of *****less, but better*****. It's what John Doerr suggested Google should do a while back.

Do less, but do it better.



## 2. Meditation

Meditation is many things. I'm no expert in this either, but one thing I've understood meditation practice to include is the intentional cultivation of focusing on less (e.g. your breath), but focusing on that harder. This trains your mind to focus on what's important. 

Less mental chatter, better presence.



## 1. “Minimalism”

Most people associate “minimalism” with possessions.  In reality, owning minimal things is only one particular form of minimalism. You could take a minimalist approach to all sorts of things.

Less clutter, better freedom. Less to maintain, better average level of maintenance. Less to do, but doing it better and more fully.



# **Quotes:**



> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time. 
<cite>Blaise Pascal</cite>



> Don’t half-ass two things… whole-ass one thing.
<cite>Nick Offerman</cite> 

[^1]: In general a good thing to shoot for is *optionality*, where you have a trial period persueing a dedicated end. You run multiple low-cost experiments and see which ones look promising based on their emperical results. This works well for sampling totally different goals, and it works for using different means to achieve the same goal. Less, but better does *not* mean "Do only this thing even if it's not working".

[^2]: I'm not wearing a shirt. And *that’s* my favorite shirt. 

[^2]: In my experience most people use the term “high concept” to mean *complicated*, per [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/high-concept) - based on an interesting and attractive idea that can be explained in a simple way.

# Motto: I'm a Creative Cat; a Star-Performing Word-Worm

Two Days Ago, March 16th, 2013, marked the 1-year anniversary of my first column on Blogger. I've written a lot about the column on the column. The reason for that is that this is a blog about my life and thoughts - and the column happens to be a non-negligible part of both of those things.

Blogger has been fantastic platform for my purposes; and I can see myself really settling in here. I mean, I've been doing it for about 1/24th of my life already, so... I guess you could say I'm settled. I want to make it to a 1000 posts, someday... but I'd settle for 100 for now. One step at a time, yo.

My grammar is not perfect, and I know that. I've had a particular weakness brought to my attention recently and it now bugs me... I suck at participles. If you've been reading the column scrutinously, there are surely dozens of examples you could have saw. 

OH THE REASON I WANTED TO WRITE THIS!

I have been badly yearning to create. I want to take and make pictures, music, and movies. I've been wanting to draw and shoot and make and craft and forge. I've already written literally the entire rest of everything in this post, though, so... I'll just leave that at that. (yes, I write these very non-linearly)

In other news:

I got an idea for a new project. In a nutshell, I want to create create high-quality movie posters for movies starring my friends, set across a wide variety of genres and eras. These movies, of course, will never come to be; but the posters hopefully will. It all spawned from a shamefully adolescent daydream that ended something like this:

![](assets/72-1.jpg)

This rough sketch was never supposed to have an audience. Now it does.
Basically, I want to recreate that drawing and other such faux-movie posters with a really high production value. A REALLY high production value. This gives me the opportunity to be creative, involve friends, technology, AND yield (hopefully) some really cool finished products. I like all those things.

**REALLY HIGH PRODUCTION VALUE**. I just wanted to make sure that got stressed enough.

I saw "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone". It was alright. Made me laugh. I didn't leave the theater disappointed that I went in. So. Take that as you will.

I leave for Thailand in 18 days.

Top 5: Data Head
5. 4 = The Least-View Column's Number of page-views... that post was about Futurama, almost a year ago - Note: "Page View" means the individual post had to be opened, does not count read-throughs done from the main page (which is how I would read these, if I were you)
4. 122 = Top Most-Viewed Column's number of page-views... that post, oddly, was the very next post: EDC Fruition
3. 5.1 = The number of days in between my average posts
2. 5.5 = My estimate of the number of people I know who read any given post (myself possibly included)
1. ~13 = How many more years I'll have to do this for, at my current rate, before I reach my 1000th post. It's a lofty dream, but hey, Ad Astra Per Aspera. 

One of my previous iterations of the column had "Numbers" instead of the Top 5. It was essentially done like that. I'm not going to go back, but I may just weasel my way into doing it every once in a while.

This Column is a love letter to things like itself. It's indulgent, but hopefully you receive it well, without too much self-aggrandizement. 

# Full-Stack Project-Doer

'Full-Stack' is a coding term, referring to the *entirety* of an application. It comprises the **front-end**, the bits you see and interact with - and the **back-end**, the bits you don't see that provide all the necessary structure and interactions with the self (or with other services). If you're a "full-stack developer" it means you work on *both* the front end and back end. You're both the Wizard of Oz **and** the man behind the curtain.

I'm applying that term more globally. Sort of like being a "Jack of All Trades", but bound to the context of a specific project or product. I love it when I see something made by one person (or a small group) who's filling tons of different roles. I love seeing the video made by the guy who figured out how to do some trick with epoxy to make some elaborate homemade nightstand featuring his own art. And if he sets it to music he wrote and performed? Oh man that's good stuff. 

I don't want to become an expert at any one 'slice' of project-doing, to the detriment of the other necessary aspects[^1]. I want to do the design, the engineering, the fabrication, the validation, apply the polish, and deliver the goods. I want the types of projects in which I endeavor to necessitate cross-domain skill. It is my goal and ambition to create new and varied things consistently for the foreseeable future[^2].

### Creation/Consumption Balance

![Untitled](assets/412-1.png)

Consuming without creating inspires no self-fulfillment. Creating without consuming limits your exposure, thereby limiting what you can create. I think my ideal ratio is somewhere close to an even 1:1. An hour spent watching a show is to be matched with an hour spent, say, writing a Column about projects. If I spent too long in one mode without shifting to the other, I start to feel anxiety or malaise. My mindset ideally winds up looking like a sinusoid. 

![Untitled](assets/412-2.png)

## Meta Project Commentary

I've noticed a change in myself. I've spent more time working on fewer arrows. I'm less okay with a torrent of poorly-edited, half-hearted work. Instead I began aiming too produce on very carefuly edittted, lovingly crafting work. I'm not interested in how much I can produce. I'm interested in how *good* what I produce can be. I'm not sure when the switch happened - I assume gradually over many years.

# Future Projects List

This is a snapshot, as of this writing, of the creative projects either immediately on my plate or on the horizon. I may or may not write in great depth about any of these in the future.

## House Documentation

We recently moved. One thing I wished I had upon taking possession of the house was some sort of owners manual or general "house documentation" that included things like:

- Maintenance history, additions to the house, etc
- List of appliances, manufacturer info, model & serial numbers, install dates, warranty dates, receipts
- Location of water shutoff, map of circuit breakers, dryer vent location, and what the one switch on the wall that seems to do nothing is there for
- General list of quirks and anything else interesting

Turns out there are dozens of apps vying to be "the" app in this space. Frustratingly, though, they are all priced on a **subscription** model. It's ludicrous to think I should pay you each year to maintain a database of my stuff that is stored on my phone or my iCloud. 

So I'm building my own. Probably just using Notion.

## Gillespie Graph

This one is by far and away the least well-defined, most ambitious, least likely to happen of these projects. Basically, I want to figure out a graph database of the world around me. Creating all of the entity types that exist in regular life and relationships between them. Imposing constraints on what can and cannot be. Then populating them into a an actual Graph database (e.g. Neo4J) documenting the world and how it works, ideally in an infinitely extensible way.

The world is a system. I want to model it.

## Personal Data Warehouse (PDW)

This is my new vernacular for the "Life Tracker" (also formerly called the "Data Journal"). This works and has worked for the past ~7 years. I continue to have new things I want to do with it, though. In particular, I'm working to containerize this to make it more deployable to wherever and however I so choose in the future. Also in doing so establishing standards & interfaces that I can use to migrate data around. Defining how conflicts should work. Playing with new UX ideas. Also trying to remove dead code to do more with less.

## Mobile Workshop

The fire that's burning brightest right now. My new house has a smaller garage than my old house. I had a nice big work bench that was 12 feet long and stored a table saw underneath it. See #2 from the Top 5 below. I want to make my own version of that sort of a thing. Something that is built to suit my particular desires and constraints. See [this Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/Mobile-Wood-Shop-Plans-248a518565f545dcbca29c7d7cc2cb65).

## Office Setup

My previous home office was always just a desk in a bedroom. I never really did anything else with the room to make it an "office". In much the same way that I want to build a Mobile Workshop to both house all my tools and use them - I want to make the office into my electronics workstation. I want a whiteboard, an ergonomic workstation with legit monitors and sound. And, rather than dump all my cables & cords into a drawer, I want to organize them. This is a start:

![AD87C1A0-7FE9-41D0-AF7F-7AFE109CCFE3.png](assets/412-3.png)

## House projects

A non-exhaustive list of things that also fall under the umbrella of "home improvement[^3]":

- Upgrade pantry shelves, add lighting
- Install recessed lighting, office
- Instal recessed lighting, living room
- "Remaster" the bathroom
- Replace the vanity in the common bath
- Paint all walls
- Paint all trim
- Replace most light fixtures

# Other Topics

A couple of other unrelated things I wanted to mention.

## Notion on iPad

The Notion app on the iPad got better. If you use a mouse, you can now move multiple blocks at once (like on the browser). They re-built the toolbar that pops up when you're editing blocks, and it's been a bit more consistent. Notion remains "the app of the future" for my money. I can't believe it's not been cloned (or acquired) by Google/Microsoft/Apple at this point. Its versatility and usability make it not only *capable* of replacing all sorts of purpose-built applications, but often times *better* than the purpose-built app for my needs.

## Photo and Markup for Projects

One of my favorite use-cases the iPad fills is the ability to quickly document measurements or ideas about a physical space *in the context of that space*. Here is a quick example of what I mean:

![72B07E44-1FA5-4C08-8F06-6E725A31D213.jpeg](assets/412-4.jpg)

That was a picture I took for the Mobile Workshop project. It illustrates the constraints of a component of a system in the context those constraints come from. It helps ground those constraints and explain them to anyone else with whom I would collaborate. Plus it's visual. I like visuals.

## Age

I'm 33 now. Cool.

## Moving

Moving is hard, yo. Home is where the heart is. My heart was always here. 



# Top 5: Projects by Others that Perfectly Represent What I'm Talking about Here



## 5. The many projects of Ben Uyeda

Ben Uyeda is self-branded as "the modern maker". He's not someone I expect many of you to have heard of, nor is he someone whose work I know well enough - but from what I've seen I'm very impressed with this guy. From building [tables using concrete and Lego](https://youtu.be/xa8ax-zHoGo), to [a solar-powered workshop](https://youtu.be/xa8ax-zHoGo), to building [an entire house](https://youtu.be/xa8ax-zHoGo) - his videos show high level of creativity and craftsmanship. Throw in [a well-designed personal website](https://www.benuyeda.com), and hey... you got a full-stack project-doer.



## 4. I Like to Make Stuff

This entry is by far and away the newest on the list. I just found the ILTMS YouTube channel a couple days back. I'm very impressed with the breadth and consistency with which the dude creates. [His airtag hiding video](https://youtu.be/U58DpjePYn8) uses a laser cutter AND good old fashion leather work and stitching. And, like everyone else in this list, he also manages to make videos while making the things he makes.



## 3. The many projects of Mark Rober

Mark Rober, whom you may know as "the [glitter bomb package](https://youtu.be/h4T_LlK1VE4) guy" or as "[the squirrel obstacle course](https://youtu.be/DTvS9lvRxZ8)" guy, is a well-known doer of massive, cross-discipline projects turned viral videos. He's a coder, metalworker, woodworker, and presenter all rolled into one. 



## 2. The "Amazing Compact Bench Build" by Jordan Frank

Jordan Frank used his tools to make his tools better. So meta. So great. He produced a great-looking final product, drew up plans & made [this website to host his plans,](https://sites.google.com/view/hidinginthegarage/home) AND documented the whole thing in [this 4-Part YouTube Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-p_j3xV5zAWOQswut9htpSA15FGDsIH), which he obviously had some fun with. This is full-stack work at its best. Video + web design + drafting + authoring + actual woodwork, and it was all done basically for fun?



## 1. Bo Burnham's "Inside"

Bo Burnham's COVID-era Netflix comedy(?) special "Inside" is a one-man, one-room show. He wrote the words, wrote the music, did the filming, costuming, set design, and editing of all of the above. It's incredible, and both worth watching while being somewhat hard to watch. Bo Burnham sets an impossibly high bar.



# **Quote:**



> Hi I'm Bob and I like to make stuff. <cite>The start of every "I Like to Make Stuff" video.</cite>

[^1]: It helps that I typically define the scope of my own projects. If the scope of a given project included "marketing", I'd probably *not* want to do that bit. 

[^2]: I don't like to say "for the rest of my life" any more. I reserve the right to change my mind and interests. I have been around long enough to know the stuff I'm interested in right now is very likely

Editor's Note 1: This post is sort of a follow-on to Columns [#291](https://aarongilly.com/291) and [#333](https://aarongilly.com/333/), in which I wrote about "unsexy solutions" to some of life's most widely-faced challenges. 

Editor's Note 2: Both of the links from Editor's Note 1 are broken right now because I'm in the middle of retroactively "fixing" all my old Columns. Eventually both of those links will work. I'm leaving it for now as incentive for me to finish that project.

# The Index Card

Back in 2013, while promoting her new book, author Helaine Olen said:

> The best [financial] advice for most people would fit on an index card - Helaine Olen[^1]

When asked what such an index card would look like, Helaine whipped out a pen, a card, hastily took a picture of it, and produced a viral image:

![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/The_Index_Card.jpg](assets/402-1.jpg)

I **love** this concept. 

This is an application of the [Pareto Principle](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/pareto-principle/) to an entire body of knowledge. Personal finance is, much to my frustration, an **incredibly** opaque and deep topic. There are volumes and volumes of in-depth analyses of the field from all sorts of sources. There are websites, books, courses, videos, and a whole industry of professional advisors to explain the subject. If you're a layperson, just getting started is intimidating. For some, too intimidating to even entertain the concept. They just accept their ignorance and hope whatever they're doing by default is "good enough".

For those that do attempt to educate themselves, they walk into a familiar situation. Any given article or book will assume the reader has a particular amount of pre-existing knowledge. As the reader, it's difficult to predict which resources will be "at your level". So you dip your toe in, you find words like "equity" and "annuity" and then you either double-down on researching or *nope* right out of there.

Even if you push past that, you're typically reading in great detail about the bark on a particular tree, when what you really need is to see the layout of the forest. You've got a dozen or more tabs open of things you've run across and decided you need to read more about, after you've figured out what this article is all about.

Enter "**The Index Card**"... 

Yes, it doesn't take into account edge case situations; and, yes, it's a rudimentary. **That's the point**, though. For 80% of people, this tiny set of advice is enough to take them from "completely ignorant" to "just *mostly* ignorant" - but with enough knowledge to *probably* make the right decisions by default. It's not even an 80/20 situation, it's better than that. It's more like 80/1 *(~80% of people can benefit from 1% of the advice or knowledge available)*.

## Other Index Card(s)

Personal finance is by no means a unique field. There are many such high-barrier-to-entry bodies of knowledge, with best practices that are known & generally agreed upon by experts in the field, about which people could benefit from a basic, easily consumable set of no-prerequisite-knowledge-needed advice. Something as simple as an index card. 

So here goes.

**NOTE:** I am not a trained/certified expert at ANY of these things. Proceed with caution.

# Motto: Aesthetic, Aesthetic, Rho, Owe, No, Gary, Me, Larry, Larry, Ewe, Site, Pneumatic, Me, Ewe

I have a plan for this post, so it might be more coherent than my last one. If not more coherent, at least more entertaining. Here’s the plan: Thoughts after leaving Facebook for a couple of months. A very confusing phonetic alphabet. A cool sense of pride. Then one line about Google.   It’s been two months since I deleted my Facebook. I wrote about deleting it November 30th of last year and I deleted it later that night, if my memory serves me. I’m now going to answer the bolded questions that I had a friend make up for me (thank you to Danielle for this one):   
**How do you look up personal info (email, cell, etc) of those obscure people you sort of know and randomly need to contact?**
I haven't had to do that so much just yet. Generally, I know of a way to contact someone who knows of a way to contact them. If not that... I don't know. Good questions.I don't contact people whose contact information I don't have very often.
**How do you know people's birthdays? (Lord knows you don't remember them.)**
I don't. Even when I DID have Facebook, I never wished people happy birthday anyway. It always seemed like a very shallow and fake thing to do. "This thing told me it was your birthday and that I should probably tell you to have a happy one, so I'm doing that".
**What about all the years of pictures you had on there?**
I went through my tagged pictures and saved 40 or 50 of my favorites to my local hard drive (later uploaded to Google Drive).
**Don't you think you'll want to look back and laugh at yourself in a few years? Like looking at a social time capsule.**
I think I have plenty of other sources to do that already. This blog. Email (I never delete emails, I have Gmail and 10 gigabytes of Gmail storage like everyone else). I think that people actually go back and look through their past too often, honestly. I think it's healthy to do so occasionally, but Facebook made me do it waaay too often. I was always made very aware of the "theory" of my social status, rather than just living it out.
**Don't you get pissed when mobile games are like, "Sign in with Facebook!"?**
Yes. But I was always pissed when it did that. Why does Facebook need to know what music I'm listening to, or what words I'm playing on whatever game on my phone, or what shows I'm watching on Hulu. It always creeped me out a little bit. The worst were those apps that decided FOR YOU what it wanted to share: "Aaron Gillespie read an article about some weird disease". What? Does he have that disease? Why is he reading that? It never jived well with me.
**Haven't you wanted to creep on at least one person since deleting it?**
I think this is my biggest problem with Facebook. It turned "creeping" on someone into something that was just normal to do. Melissa linked me to a post one time where a girl made an excellent point that I totally agree with. The TL;DR of it all was that her friend got a new boyfriend that she was unsure of. She added him on Facebook and, when he added her back, she went through all his posts and pictures and statuses to make sure she wasn't creepy - only to realize that she was being the creepy one. Why did she need to see everything this guy had done in his past? Why didn't she just meet him and see what kind of a person he was for herself? Everyone on Facebook is guilty of creeping on someone at some point in time and that's just, well, creepy. Why are we okay with it?
**What about the children?? Ignore that last one, just wanted to say it.**
Facebook is absolutely no place for kids. If I had a catalog of everything I thought and said and did when I was a kid, right up through middle school, I would delete it off the hard drive. Burn the hard drive. Throw those burnt ashes into a vat of acid. Put that acid into a box and sink that box to the bottom of the ocean. People posting every little thing about their kid bugs me, too. "Little Billy has the rash again! :-(". Little Billy's future girlfriend is going to creep on Billy's parents and think "why was he getting rashes? Would our kids get these rashes? Does he have the plague?!".
**How in the world will you poke people now?!** 
That's not a real-life thing. It's not a real life thing so it has no need to exist on the internet. Poking should die.

That ends my Q&A about leaving Facebook. The one question I'm surprised she didn't ask was "Do you miss it?" I had an answer ready for that one. It was a simple and resounding "No."

## In other news:

I was thinking about the phonetic alphabet the other day and the scene from “The Hangover” where Alan says “’k’ as in ‘knife’”. I thought that was a pretty hilarious concept. I decided to expand upon it. Namely: Every letter in the alphabet. 

Each of the things would be said “(the letter) as in (the word)”. So, I present to you, my version of the most confusing phonetic alphabet possible:   

A – Aesthetic  
B – Barry  
C – Cite  
D – Doe  
E – Ewe  
F – Foe  
G – Gary  
H – Hors D’oeuvres  
I – Me  
J – Jerry  
K – Know  
L – Larry  
M – Moe   <- I just realized I have two of the 3 stooges back to back here. Ha.  
N – No  
O – Owe  
P – Pneumatic  
Q – Qi  
R – Rho  
S – Site  
T – Teri  
U – W Divided by Two (but not in Spanish)  
V – A Roman Five (or W divided by 2 in Spanish)  
W – Wholly  
X – Xena Warrior Princess  
Y – You  
Z – Zima   

The new phonetic alphabet – easy as Aesthetic, Barry, Cite.   

So, the other day I ran into someone I went to high school with out in the real world. This hadn’t ever happened to me before then. This particular person wasn’t really the kind of person I hung out with much in high school. Don’t get me wrong, I would have loved to hang out with her. She was super nice and pretty… but she wasn’t in my class and I was generally too much of a wuss to talk to pretty girls. Anyway, we made eye contact before either of us recognized each other. When that recognition happened, it happened all at once to both of us. There was a “Heeey!” moment and I immediately got up hugged her like an old friend (it was only much later that I realized “wait, we never were never old friends… we never hugged in high school… we never even really talked in high school… why did I hug her? I guess I’m a hugger”). We had a very brief catch-up session. She is a nurse, working here in Kansas City for another few months. It made me happy to see someone else from my high school who went on to be successful. The thing that made me the most happy and caught me the most off-guard about all of this was just how proud I was when I talked about where I was and what I have done with my life thus far. I walked away from that 3 minute conversation way happier than would have expected myself to be if I were to theorize what running into someone like her would go like.   So that was cool… and speaking of cool:   Google put up a new Android statue on their campus. It’s made of chrome - and that’s awesome.

(Chrome is the name of their internet browser, mom)
This made my inner nerd so happy.

In this Column: the coolest I can be juxtaposed with possibly the *least* cool I can be.

# Basketball 🏀

I have a complicated relationship with basketball.

![[453-1.png]]

On one hand, I don’t love the game. People always want to talk to me about it, but I’ve never found basketball as enjoyable as I did skateboarding when I was younger, or playing pool, or even just a really good workout… on the other hand, I’m not *bad* at it. I don’t hate it. I would go so far as to say I *really enjoy* some parts about it: the process of simply shooting baskets, the workout, and the chance to play *with* people.

Basketball is the closest thing I have to experiencing human *synchronicity*. I’ve read about the feeling of *performing*, moving in-time with others, and the give-and-take that people find so joyous in choirs and choruses. That taps into some sort of very primal “part of the tribe” area of our evolutionary biology, and brings about a sense well-being. Or, at least that's what *supposedly* happens. I’m not in a band, not in a chorus. The closest thing I have to being able to relate to that feeling is basketball. There are some guys I will always like - even though my only interaction with them was on a basketball court. 

As of this writing, I just I played what is probably **my last ever game basketball** a couple days ago. It was the most in-sync I have felt with a group of guys in a very long time. We played well - in particular I had a great game. The final game of my career and I finally realized how to be ~6’9”. 

I was never *great* at the game.

I lack the killer instinct that some people seem to be born with. I want to have fun. It was rare that I wanted to “beat” a team very badly, let alone *“destroy”* them. At best, I just didn’t want to lose a game. Even then, it was mostly so that people around me weren’t disappointed. Only a couple times in my life was I truly *emotionally* invested in basketball as a sport. Every single one of those times, I was actively playing. I cannot bring myself to care about *watching* someone else play a sport. I suspect this may change when I’m watching my sons play.

![[453-2.png]]

I suspect I’ll miss basketball, but only as a good reason to hang out with some particular dudes.

# Fallout

Fallout is a recently-released TV show on Amazon Prime, based on a video game series by the same name. The TV show is good, although I cannot really recommend it to *anyone*, per se. There are tons of off-putting aspects to the show (and video games) that happen to align with my tastes, but I could easily see many (perhaps most) not agreeing with. It’s silly, but also horrific. It plays up gore for laughs from time to time. If that’s not your bag, that makes total sense.

What I want to say about Fallout is how *impressed* I am with it as a show, and separately, how impressed I am about it as a video game. 

![[453-3.png]]

The show looks **incredible**. The set design, costumes, locations, and effects are without exception *phenomenal*. They brought that world to life in immaculate detail. No part of that production was put together half-heartedly. They captured the spirit and the feel of the games so well. I very much enjoyed the show.

The video game is so incredibly technically amazing, despite the series being known for game-breaking glitches and bugs. When I played Fallout 4 eight years ago my mind was absolutely blown. They’ve made a living, breathing land. Complete with day-and-night cycles, hundreds of named characters, interwoven stories, dozens of types of enemies, hundreds of types of material, equipment, and weapons. Everything exists in the same, cohesive system. So so so much creativity packed into the experience. 

As a person who writes code from time-to-time, I’m flabbergasted by the fact that things like Fallout can be made… which is embarrassing to admit because I know things like ChatGPT and the operating system I’m using right now are much more technically impressive than the bug-ridden franchise that is Fallout… but if you pulled some Pong-playing nerd from the year 1972 forward and tried to explain what Fallout: New Vegas is, I reckon they wouldn’t believe this sort of thing is possible.

# Semantic Canvas

Coding is a superpower. This Column is running long and nobody probably cares about this but me, but I wrote and released a plug-in for the note taking app “Obsidian”, which is now generally available through their community plugin list: [Semantic Canvas](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=semantic-canvas). It’s been installed by 889 people as of this writing. 

It solves a problem I was having with the app. I wanted to be able to use the arrows you draw in Obsidian’s “Canvas” feature to modify the notes you put on it. That wasn’t possible. So made it possible. Took two days. 

![[453-4.png]]

My plugin lets this canvas 👆 update all the notes it contains to reflect the groups they’re in & the canvas elements they’re linked to. As an example, the “Lisa” note, after running my plugin:

![[453-5.png]]

If that makes no sense to you, THAT’S ALRIGHT ENJOY THE TOP 5.

# Motto: I sat in the theater of Looper with a camera. I looked at myself in the camera and watched myself watching myself watch myself watch Looper.

Life is too awesome - and I'm seriously worried about that.

Things just don't go this awesomely for extended periods of time. The last time I can remember being so happy for an extended period of time I wound up with a permanently messed-up back despite the fact I did nothing to it. I spent the next year getting out of that funk.

Being this happy, having this much to be happy about, I know it just gives me a long way to fall if something were to happen. 

The pessimist in me wrote that portion of the column. He's now going to go lay down and read A Million Little Pieces by James Frey and weep and wallow in a pit of despair.

Alright this column is getting too weird.

I have worked for one full week now at my new job. My first "Big boy job". And I must say, I really do feel like a big boy. I live in my own place in the big city. I am making money doing something I actually want to be doing. Just to ere on the side of caution, I won't say where I work by name - I'll just say this: it is a technically focused job in the communications industry. I like my boss a lot. I like my coworkers. I have even liked the generic training type stuff I've done so far. 

I bought "The Avengers". There was honestly no chance of me NOT buying "The Avengers". Amazon had (has?) a deal to get the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy for $20. Oh, and you get the 3D Blu-Ray and a compendium of songs randomly thrown together that have nothing to do with the movie, but who cares about those. Just to recap what I said 29 columns ago: The Avengers was IS awesome. To watch The Avengers I checked out the theater room of my apartment building:

![](assets/33-1.jpg)

I didn't know this picture was taken.

Melissa speaks for the both of us... and everyone else that showed up later.
I watched Looper with Melissa for $10. It was AWESOME. That's all I have to say.
Just to recap:

I like being an adult.

I like my place.

I like my job.

Things are awesome.

Top 5: Good things to happen for me lately
5. >1 person has asked me if I've been working out. Why yes, more than one person, I have been. I have a goal.
4. I saw my girlfriend. If you, the reader, had forgotten, she's quite attractive.
3. My apartment complex has AWESOME amenities. Three days ago, I was swimming in a heated pool on the 15th floor of a highrise, overlooking downtown Kansas City, celebrating with a group of great friends. Then there was that Avengers thing...
2. Everyone who has seen my place has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to it. It turned out way better even than I anticipated and I am psyched to call it home for the next year or more.
1. I started my career off at what seems like it's going to be a great place to work, gaining experience doing what I want to do with my life.

# Motto: 3 Day Weekends are the Best

I have several things on my writing docket. This is the first paragraph of the update and I'm still not sure which direction I'm going to take it. I'm as far on the edge of my seat as you are.

I think I'm going to write about something that isn't on my agenda.

I have just realized one major disadvantage of living a healthy-ish lifestyle - at my current rate I will never be able to say "I just made this one little change and I'm so much healthier!". [This question on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f6yuw/what_is_one_small_lifestyle_change_you_can_do_to/) got me thinking, "man, I couldn't ever just 'walk some' and see any benefits. I already walk. That's crap." 

I can't quit smoking because I never started. My life is so hard.

On to something I had planned to write about: 

As seen in recent posts, I am trying to more and more utilize the Column as a final resting place for my creative projects. I want to focus a little more on videos I've made, pictures I've taken, ~poetry~ wordplay I've created, and maybe even introduce audio I've recorded. With this, I want hoping to focus a little less on "this is what happened on Saturday"-type entries. There will still be a fair amount of both, though.

Also as seen in my previous post, I'm trying to figure out a way to incorporate a section of blue text in each update. I have a running theme in most all of my independent creative projects where I try to utilize red, blue, green, and yellow in a major way. 

Did you notice the Motto was yellow?

The most obvious solution is to add a new feature to every post. I only hesitate because I fear writer's block. For now, I'm going to (re)introduce the Fact of the update.


**Fact: Melissa should be home in 29 days**

That will be at the top of my posts for future columns. I'm going to test it out.

The last thing I wanted to write about: 

Just before I left for California I caught internet lightning in a bottle when I created and posted the following (incredibly stupid) image:

![](assets/91-1.gif)

Disclaimer - this is actually a higher-quality version than the version that went semi-viral
Anyway, the inventor of the Graphics Interchange Format (.GIF) image recently went on record saying he meant for the format to be pronounced with a soft G (like "giraffe") and not with a hard G (like "Gift"). This led to a rehost and repost of my original image by some person I've never met. The repost hit the front page again. If you add the view count from the original to the view count of the rehosted version, my incredibly stupid image has been seen 2136273 times. That's an exact number that is accurate as of this writing.

If, for some reason, everyone who saw the JIF GIF decided to form a 51st state, the new JIF GIF state would be the 36th most populous in the Union. It would sit right between Utah and New Mexico.

This is my annual "Year in Review" and goal-setting Column. Before we get into the thick of it, though...

# The Times, They are a Changin'

In so many ways, right now feels like the space between eras. Obviously this is a "year in review" post, so the simple transition between years is in play - but it's more than that. Some ways are exciting, other ways are bittersweet, and yet other ways I'm not enthusiastic about at all.

- My youngest is starting up after-school activities. This means **most nights** of the week we will be running the boys to and fro. We're entering into that "all I do is drive people places" era.
- A podcast I've listened to for 8 years is ending.[^1] They were a big comedy influence on me. It's a real bummer.
- **I'm starting grad school**! I'll get to learn cool new stuff, but the era of homework begins anew.
- I stopped trying to make my Personal Data Warehouse a fully home-grown thing and reverted back to a humble spreadsheet, giving it the new[^2] moniker of [[Data Journal]] to mark the transition.
- Politics.

The previous bit of my life has been very good to me. I hope the new era can be as good as the previous one was.

# Aaron "Wrapped"

It feels like *every* app I have an account with has come out with a feature mimicking "Spotify Wrapped". I got annual summaries from Spotify itself, my weightlifting app, my podcast app, Endel, Google Photos, and YouTube... and those are just the ones I remember.

I was ahead of the curve on this "this year I the data say I did...". See [[447|2023]], [[427|2022]], [[415|2021]], [[404|2020]], [[384|2019]], [[359|2018]], [[330|2017]], [[304|2016]], [[277|2015]]. Looks like this is my 10th annual "Year in Review" Column.

# 2024 Year in Data

Sorry in advance about how often [[459|75 Hard]] gets mentioned here. It affected everything immensely.

## Heath

### Exercise

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Work out 183 times   
> *Result:* **222 Workouts**

More so than anything else on this list, this year we succeeded at **working out**. Thanks in particular to the 75 Hard, I far surpassed my "admittedly ambitious" goal.. As a result, Melissa and I are the fittest we've ever been.[^3] 

![[467-1.png]]

So that's awesome. What's less awesome is how *poorly* I've done on my [[459#Infinite Firm|Infinite Firm]] goals post 75 Hard. 

![[467-2.png]]

You may note I claimed adherence to the 75 Hard "Workout x2 per Day" rule, but the math for the chart doesn't line up. That's because what I constituted as a 75 Hard "2nd workout" doesn't perfectly overlap what I deem a "trackable workout". 

![[467-3.png]]

### Eating Out

> [!fail] 
> *Goal:* Eat out 122 times  
> *Result:* **194** times ate out

This is essentially the **opposite** of the above result. This was somewhat the result of me driving into the office more than I was expecting, but more so just due to laziness leading up to the 75 Hard (and some level of return to laziness after). I'd like to reign this number back next year. 

![[467-4.png]]

This looks worse than it is, probably. I didn't eat out much in 2020 compared to usual, for obvious reasons. 2021 was not much different, for reasons that weren't much different. Still, this is probably the thing I'll pay the most attention to in 2025.

### Drinks

I track any drink that's **not water, coffee, or tea**. Basically if it's not those things, it gets lumped in as a "less healthy" drink. These numbers reflect soda, energy drinks, and alcoholic drinks. 

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Reduce & broaden drink varieties  
> *Result:* **Reduced** by ~25-30%

This was actually pretty much a perfect continuation of previous habits, aside from the 75 Day stint that had none. I am still pretty happily with this result. I'd like to see a further reduction here, probably. 

![[467-5.png]]

I used to have an energy drink more days than not. This year I only had 11. So that's good. However that's been offset by a minor increase in mixed drinks, which are *not* better for you. Still, the total is equivalent to "a couple a week", which ends up looking like more than it sounds like. 

### Sleep

> [!caution] 
> *Goal:* Keep up healthy sleep habits  
> *Result:* Bedtime ❌, duration ✅

My sleep *duration* has averaged out nicely, but something happened with my **bedtime** around the time we were doing the 75 Hard where it slipped back ***significantly***. My global "average" bedtime is about 11:20 PM. By the end of 75 Hard I was **averaging** 12:25 AM. This whole timeframe needs shifted forward some.

![[467-6.png]]

That chart was straight from my Oura ring, btw.

## Content Creation

### Notes

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* add ~200 new notes  
> *Result:* **334** new notes

I'm still writing notes at a rate of *~1/day*. This year's notes ventured more into business-ey things. That's the macro trend. These are all hosted at https://gillespedia.com, by the way.

### Columns

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Write ~18 Columns  
> *Result:* **20 Columns**, including this one

I've settled in on the ~1.5 Columns/month cadence. I like it.

### Other Stuff

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Reintroduce ad-hoc creation tracking  
> *Result:* [[Creations Catalog|Success]]!

## Content Consumption

> [!tldr] 
> I guess I'm a reader?

![[467-7.png]]

### Books

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Read 18 books  
> *Result:* **31 1/2** books

Apparently I read a lot? I was surprised to see this number. Hooray.

### Movies

> [!fail] 
> *Goal:* Watch 36 new movies  
> *Result:* **22** new movies, 30 total movies

I thought 2024 was a bit of a downer year in terms of movies. Aside from Dune 2, no movies really blew me away this year. I'm not sure if that's caused my movie number to fall short of the goal, but it certainly didn't help. For a guy who claims to love movies, I sure don't watch many.

### TV

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Keep pace with ~75 TV sessions  
> *Result:* **70** sessions

I watch TV a little more than 1/week. This year I kept that pace. I watched 18 different shows. SNL was the most consistent. The worst show was Marvel's Echo. The best was my re-watch of Jury Duty. 

### Games

> [!success] 
> *Goal:* Play through 2 videogames  
> *Result:* **Success** - I finished
> 1. Animal Well 
> 2. Fallout: New Vegas
> 3. Rise of the Golden Idol

I like videogames. I'd like to play them *slightly* more than I do.[^4]

### Podcasts

> [!caution] 
> *Goal:* Slow down on podcast listening  
> *Result:* **Nope**.

I don't know exactly how much time I spent listening to podcasts in 2023, but I think 2024 was pretty much the same. I imagine this number will go down in 2025 since my favorite podcast is ending.

### YouTube

> [!fail] 
> *Goal:* Watch less YouTube  
> *Result:* The **opposite**

I said that eating out was my biggest failure of the year. Actually it was YouTube. My numbers are skewed by me being signed in on the family TV, so I get views tracked for things the boys watch... but still most of it is me. And I'm well above an average of 10 videos/day. That's *astounding*. YouTube is the reason my TV and movie numbers aren't high. 

On a related note - I just got YouTube Premium for the year. So I'm sure that will help. :-|

## Social

I more or less realized I wasn't tracking social outings during this year, so the data aren't really here to back up any results. In 2024 I started hanging out with a few new friends, which was cool. We got in some good dates. We got in some good trips for the sake of the boys. Did a couple of concerts. Went to an awesome wedding. 2024 was a good mix of things. On the whole I'm fairly pleased. Could always use *more*; but there are only so many hours in the day, days in the week, and weeks in the year.

# 2024 Year in Projects

This was a very project-heavy year.

## Revisiting Project Goals from [[447|Column 447]]

- **Vacations** - the biggest failure of this year. Aside from (multiple) trips to Silver Dollar City, this year was essentially vacation-less. Easily the most disappointing aspect of the year.
- **Add a modestly-sized new feature to the PDW** - not sure how to classify this. Success? Then I tore it down and started from scratch? Then I tore **that** down and started from scratch again?
- **Finish some more house projects** - one giant one crowded out all others. We did the master bath & closet, including the floor, walls, and a brand new shower.
- **Start Up a Podcast** - success, although we had to slow down production to a crawl of nominally 1 episode per month, we are still at it! Episode 19 just came out.
- **Create another Puzzle Box** - success! You can even play it [by clicking here](https://aaronspuzzles.com/BriefMystery)!
- **Migrate this Website** - success! Although my goals changed from what I wrote a year ago, I achieved them.

### Other Project-y Things

In addition to the list above, this year I:

- Became a developer of [a published Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/aarongilly/obsidian-semantic-canvas-plugin) with >4000 installs as of now
- Did a 75 Hard *(have I mentioned that?)* with Melissa

# 2025 Themes

The YouTuber GCPGrey has a philosophy re: New Year's Resolutions that he explains very well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE). 

While I have found **actual resolutions** to be very helpful for me, personally, I *also* like the idea of a theme for the year.

## The Year of "Let it Be"

There are a number of connotations of "let it be" that I'd like to apply to my life. In general, it's a commitment to trying not to worry about stuff as much.[^5] More specifically means these things, at a minimum:

- Don't mess with the Data Journal or my productivity system.[^6] They are both working well. Just use them. 
- Better accept that which you cannot (or *should* not) control. 
- Finding replacement behaviors for some anxious habits I've tried kicking for years.

# Tracking Goals for 2025

Nothing dramatically different from last year here, but for the sake of continuity here they are.

## 5. Content Creation

- Write 18 Columns
- Add 300 new notes

- Keep pace on TV viewing

## 3. Social

Same as last year. Since the most recent Data Journal I've got a better reason to track these, so hopefully these can turn into hard numbers next year. Some of these are *quite* ambitious, but they are where I'd like to be.

- Capture 52 quotes
- See friends 26 times
- See family 26 times
- Go on 13 dates
- See 4 concerts
- Do 13 fun outings (e.g. bowling, golfing, etc)

## 2.  Health

- Move forward my average bed and wake time to 11:00 and 7:00, respectively
- Work out 183 times - every other day
- Eat out 156 times - that's 3x/week, which should be doable
- Drink 156 trackable drinks - same as above

## 1.  Don't Retool the Data Journal

LET IT BE.

# Top 5: Project Goals for 2025

## 5. Learn 2 New (coding) Languages

Specifically, Python & Lua.

## 4. Model & 3D Print *Something*

3D printing seems cool. I'd like to learn the process.

## 3. Build a new Puzzle Box

I've got a couple of ideas, not committing to a name or theme yet. May combine nicely with the above 2 goals.

## 2.  Finish the Basement

An ambitious goal, but overdue.

## 1. Succeed at School

Don't fail at school and don't let school make me fail at life outside of school.

# Motto One: Three column's in one.

# Motto Two: Not too long, though.

# Motto Three: I promise.

A lot has gone on since my last update. Realistically, I should could have updated the column three times since then...but I haven't. However, in my "To Do" application, underneath the "The Column" category, I have 3 Quotes and 3 Top 5's. Rather than push them back, I think I'll just to a quick "feature dump" by treating this update like three different columns.

Column One: Pre-2013

The week or two before new years was filled with me seeing people. If you check out my second-a-day video (more on that later) you'll see it's basically just a catalog of who I saw and what we did on any given day. This is great, though. That's what the holidays are for.

Column Two: 2013!

It's 2013! For some reason, that doesn't seem like the future to me. 2012 always seemed like the future in 2011. Even during 2012 I constantly thought "it's 2012... we are LIVING IN THE FUTURE!". Now. Now I don't know what to think. We are in the post-future. The apocalypse (more on that later) came and went and hardly anyone died, as far as I know. 2013 wasn't supposed to happen!

We are all lucky.

I have made some New Year's resolutions. To keep the trend I'll just say (more on that later).

I was finally able to give Melissa the Nexus 4 I ordered for her over a month ago. We are technological twins. Feels good.

We played another "minute to win it" night with our friends in our building. It was faaaaantastic fun - despite the the fact that I didn't win this time. Stupid ping pong balls.

Column Three: Business Trip

I am writing you this post from a hotel room in Oklahoma City, OK. I am here for business. I brought the company car. I am on company time. And the company is going to pay for the meal I'm going to go eat right after this (although, really, in a roundabout way, they pay for every meal I get).

Traveling for business is interesting. It's actually not half bad, really. I have already had the chance to check out some of OKC, and I'm still going to be here for another 8 days. During the 30 minutes I was in town, I used my phone to take a photo, video, panorama, photosphere, and make a GIF. This doesn't seem impressive until you learn that I did all of it without consciously realizing just how fully I was utilizing my new camera (phone). This speaks a ton to how natural and useful EACH of the new modes is in Android's 4.2 camera (and the GIF maker app I installed).

# Top 5 One: Non-Apple iProducts
5. iBm (International Business Machines, not "i Bowel Movement") - This one I made up cause I couldn't think of any others right now... the rest are legitimate
4. iBeats by Dre - a stupid headphone trend makes headphones with a stupid trendy name
3. I, Robot - My iPhone held a heavy object above me. It dropped it with the full intention of saving me from it before it crushed me... then it changed its mind.
2. IHOP - International House of Phones
1. iFone - a phone company in Mexico that Apple sued... despite them having that name for years before the original iPhone came out. True story.

# Top 5: New Year's Resolutions
5. Live a more disciplined life overall. Sleep at a decent time. Things of that nature.
4. Start saving money more successfully.
3. Keep finding projects to do and things to learn.
2. Keep the projects I'm currently working on going until completion.
1. While Melissa is away, I'm going to become the most physically fit man I've ever been . Oh yeah, she's leaving for half a year, I don't think I've mentioned this yet. It's a story for another column.

# Top 5: Ideas this Hotel Room has Given Me for Weight Loss
5. No stove. That one's easy.
4. A fridge the size of a shoebox. Also an easy call.
3. A mirror overhanging the place where you eat. One that only lets you see your face. You have to watch yourself chew every bite. After a while, you don't feel like eating anymore because you realize you look like a pig.
2. No light switches. Instead - 10 different lamps which must all be turned on and off by walking to them. Turning the lights off is now exercise.
1. Instead of shower curtains, a clear glass wall. On the other side of this wall, a full-body mirror, about 10 feet in the distance - so you can get a gooood look at just how fat you look every morning.

# Quote One:
> **“It's like a car wash for your butt”**
<cite>Anonymous</cite>

# Quote Two:
> **“It's the little wrecking ball in your throat”**
<cite>Melissa's cousin as an answer to the question 'what's a uvula?'</cite>

# Quote Three:
> **“So... when I uncork an apocalyptic thunderpoop they all know? Oh great”**
<cite>Redditor Spinozasrobot, after finding out the bathrooms in the rear of an airplane are not very soundproof</cite>

**DUAL TOPICS.** 

Skip to the unrelated Top 5 if you’re not willing to bite on either of these. Both of these things perfectly explain why I’ve not written a Column in over a month.

# Tears of the Kingdom

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was one of the best games of all time. Easily in my Top 3 (if not Top 1) games I've ever \played. So when its sequel, 6+ years in the making, finally came out - you cannot imagine the expectations I had for Tears of the Kingdom.

And yet it surpassed those expectations. 

It’s such an expansive, dense, interesting world. It is **incredibly** good at making you say “oooo what’s that over there?” and while you’re on your way over to the thing you say “oooo actually what’s this thing?” and having that happen again and again. It’s a non-stop chain of finding 3 interesting things while you’re on your way to the first one, then finding 3 more while you double-back to check out one of the others. 

Breath of the Wild showed open world games how things could be done. It was the first game (that I’m aware of) to become massive for its “systemic gaming”. Nearly everything that happens in the minute-to-minute gameplay is a result of a complex series of in-game systems. Objects have all sorts of properties and behaviors, and they can interact with each other in numerous often incredibly complex ways. Each enemy is programmed not to fight **you** the player, but to fight **anything** that isn’t part of it’s group. So you can lead one batch of enemies on a chase to another totally separate type of enemy, then just hide out and watch them fight each other. Something as simple as “fire” has innumerable uses. You can warm yourself up near a fire, use it to produce light, cook food, create an updraft of warm air that you can ride using a glider, destroy wooden obstacles, and as a weapon. When it rains your fire goes out. If you build a roof over the fire, the rain doesn’t put the fire out. These are all things that we would expect should work in the real world, but actually having them built into a game is crazy. When you think of a solution to a problem, usually that solution does work… and often it’s *probably* not exactly what the game makers had in mind. 

It’s super fun. Incredibly impressive through technical and artistic lenses. 10/10 all-around.

I need the game to be over soon. It’s taken a couple-to-a-few hours a day away from what were definitely better ways to spend them.

## Zelda & Appreciating Life

It’s both funny and sad how much this game gives you a feeling like you’re a kid again. Everything is potentially cool and interesting. Everything is maybe fun. It’s all unknowns and it feels good to start to gain mastery over where you are, how you control as a player, and what you’re trying to do. I go explore Hyrule for hours on end, but haven’t yet gone to my local hiking trail. There is a review that I’m unfortunately unable to find right now that a man wrote about how he played the predecessor to this Zelda game and he realized how differently he was framing his real life to that of the life you experience playing that game. Around every corner is opportunity to be discovered. Everything there is has *something* that we could appreciate more. 

Pick any arbitrary subject and there’s a vast and deep pool of appreciation that you’re probably not partaking in[^1]. My spouse has taken a deeper interest in plants recently - it’s really cool when she gets excited about some particular variant I’d previously never even known to exist. 

So much of life, if you’re not careful, devolves into ‘getting through’ things. Getting through doing your taxes. Getting through house work (see: below). Getting through a workout. Getting through going to the doctor. It’s nice to have something remind you from time to time that this whole thing is supposed to be fun. Maybe stopping to explore around a new corner in Zelda can help me remember to stop and smell the metaphorical roses.

# House Work

Owning a house can be a part-time job. The house we bought two years ago has *definitely* been. In the two years we’ve lived here we’ve definitely put in more cumulative housework than we did in the 6 years we lived at our previous place. 

Melissa and I sat down a month (or so) back and made a list of 50 house projects. From big things (one of which you’ll see below) to small things (like replacing a light switch). We’ve done an absolute blitzkrieg over the past few weeks and knocked out 10 of them.

## Incomplete List of Projects Done

In the past two months we’ve…

- fixed a backyard drainage problem (burying a small new pipe)
- fixed a side yard and sump pump drainage problem (burying a large new pipe)
- stripped and resealed our two decks (one of which is very large)
- replaced the pump of our small water fountain
- replaced the entire water feature, (burying 1000lbs of concrete)
    
    ![IMG_8976D.jpeg](assets/436-1.jpg)

- amongst other things

## Shoveled to Death

I properly messed up my back/neck area doing the concrete work. I’ve been out of commission for 2 full weeks now due to what’s likely a slightly herniated disc in my lower-neck/upper-back region. Turns out being physically fit isn’t good enough. I’m the opposite of that guy from The Mystery Men. I shovel bad.

Having a messed up back is a pretty good reason to sit down and play a ton of Zelda, though.



# Top 5: Animal Types I’m Scared to Identify in Front of Others



## 5. Mouse and Rat

Rats are bigger… but how much bigger? Where's the line? If I see a medium-to-large rodent I'm going to say “AHHH RODENT” instead of committing to mouse or rat.



## 4. Frog and Toad

Toads are bigger, and bumpier. At least in my head. Pretty sure. 



## 3. Monkey and Ape

Apes are more human-looking? Also larger, I think. Monkeys have harrier faces or something.



## 2. Alligator and Crocodile

Something about their nose. Crocodiles are pointier? 



## 1. Dolphin and Porpoise

I *think* it’s something to do with their nose? Dolphins are pointier?

**Motto: Zen Mode Engage**  

  
I have decided to learn more about computer science. I've done _some_ "coding" for several years, but it's pretty much always been using the same language, using the same environment, using mostly the same functions for mostly the same type of problem. As a starting point, I've decided to take the Udacity courses that lead to their "Front-End Web Developer" nanodegree (note: I'm just auditing the courses, not getting a nanodegree). I've never really touched HTML or CSS. I only "sorta" know how webservers and websites actually work. I want to expand that knowledge and learn to build cool stuff.   
  
If the Front-End Web Developer courses are fun, I'll move on to the Full-Stack Web Developer courses. If those are fun, I'll do the Data Analyst courses. My surface-level goals are to learn how to create a website, possibly move this blog over to my own domain, and possibly create a "Life Tracker 3.0" using my own backend & data management. My ACTUAL goal is to decide if I am at all interested in potentially taking my career in a tangential path.   
  
The stable version of Chrome OS just upgraded to version 42.0\. This effects literally nobody I know other than myself, but I want to say it's really nice. I like the design direction.   
  
I bought a bike.

It's nothing fancy, but it's sized somewhat appropriately for me. It's crazy what a difference that makes in terms of ride comfort. I"m pretty happy about it. Naturally, it's raining outside all weekend.
  
  
Top 5: Programming Projects I've Done (in order of difficulty)

4\. A Mine Sweeper Game  
3\. The Life Tracker - version 2.0 (much simpler than 1.0, but much more useful)

Last November I bought an iPhone. I spent *much* of the previous 10 months adapting to both it and the Apple ecosystem. If you had my browsing history (say, from my [Google Takeout](https://aarongilly.com/366) you could find, separated by only a couple of days, search results for “trade an iPhone XS for a OnePlus 7 Pro” and “iPhone 2019 rumors”. If you were to plot out my attitude on this Apple experiment, you’d probably see I have been mostly in the camp of “man I regret this”. I have hated how the iPhone behaves while driving. I hated how Siri doesn’t integrate with services I use. I hated how my time tracking app has to say “you used your phone for 3 hours, but I have no idea doing what because Apple won't let me”. I hate how it doesn't integrate with stuff I have used for a long time now.

This leads me to my current situation. Like most of what I'm getting at here today, my current situation something [I've written about before](https://aarongilly.com/360) ([twice](https://aarongilly.com/109): Mixed ecosystems. I believe the **worst** user experience is one in which you are trying to sync your Google Contacts with Microsoft Outlook running on your Apple MacBook... and yet, I woke up a week ago realizing: **I have my finger in every possible pie**.

# Crap I Own

## Apple

- iPhone
- Handmedown iPad
- Handmedown Apple Watch
- Handmedown MacBook (as of a week ago)

## Google

- Google Home(s)
- Chromecast(s)
- Chromebook laptop, running ChromeOS
- That same Chromebook also runs Android

## Linux

- That same Chromebook *also* runs Linux

## Microsoft

- Windows 10 Desktop PC

## Amazon

- Alexa

"Digital Minimalism" my butt.  

**I'm that guy I wrote about.**  

I'm a walking realization of the tedium of managing to different standards. Most everything I don't like about the iPhone is as a result of me not using it the way it's *meant* to be used.

So what are you trying to say?

# I'm going all-in on Apple

I said "[I've thought it would happen at some point](https://aarongilly.com/337)". I think it's happening. I've written ([several times](https://aarongilly.com/354) about [my growing disdain for Google](https://aarongilly.com/374). They have meandered around too much. They start something that I get really excited about, then they've wandered away from it. Shame on them.
Then they did it again. Shame on me.  
Then they did it again. Shame on me.  
Then they did it again. Shame on me.  

I'm getting older. I don't want to keep changing everything because the basket in which I put my eggs was left behind by the manufacturer. My technological partner has dissociative identity disorder. While it's true they sometimes put out some really incredibly stuff... I'm getting to the point where just want old dependable. Google isn't interested in putting out a video editing suite. They aren't going to make a Chromebook that I can truly do everything I want to do

Those grievances I opened the Column with were obvious, blatant things. They culminated in several boiling points, which were incredibly visible... but I have come to appreciate some *subtler* things about my phone, the Apple ecosystem, and Apple in general. 

I have written about the pros and cons of the iPhone before, so I will be retreading some ground here and for that I apologize. For the sake of completeness, here: (skip this if you like)

## Things I love about the iPhone

1. This phone does **not** die. My android phone was constantly tethered to the wall. Some of it has to do with age, but even after accounting for age, no android phone I’ve ever owned has ever come *close* to matching what this phone does day in and day out. This makes me look at my phone more like a useful tool and less like a baby needing constant care. 
2. I reap the benefits of this phone be the de facto standard of phones. All accessories, rental cars, and anything else I might need is guaranteed to work flawlessly with this phone. 
3. It’s nice that I can now work anybody else’s iPhone and that Melissa doesn’t have to figure out how to work my phone's OS.
4. Videos look *incredible*. Live Photos are super helpful at compensating for blinks and just-barely-mistimed pictures. 
5. This phone will retain relevance and speed for the next several years. **It will continue to be considered in the greater ecosystem for the foreseeable future.** No feature from this phone will become unusable as it gets depreciation. The apps on this phone will continue to exist and be at least as useful as they are today. If I commit to iMessage now, it will continue to work and be a centerpiece of the ecosystem for the next 5+ years. I have no faith Google apps will stick around and be developed for. Apple Health won’t slowly transition into the glorified pedometer app that Google Fit became.
6. It works. It's bugged out maybe twice in the 10 months I've been using it. Apps don't crash. The phone doesn't hang. It doesn't randomly reboot itself. 

Most of what I complained about in [Column #358](https://aarongilly.com/358) (yet another time I talked about this) boiled down to "*my iPhone is more difficult to use in the car*". Most of that vitriol went away when I rented a car that had CarPlay and I realized how delightful the experience was. Yes, it sucks that my vehicles are both too old for Apple - but I know that's a situation with an end in sight. Same goes for my preference of USB C over the Lightning Connector. Just wait. Lightning connector is going away (next year, most likely).

So that leaves me with relatively *few* complaints about the iPhone. Meanwhile, I'm writing this Column from a 2013 MacBook Air. It runs like a champ. I installed a great code editor on it. It can run Garage Band. It can run iMovie. If I wanted to, it could run Plex and Handbrake and all the other stuff I use my Windows Desktop to do. I plotted out everything I want my tech to be able to do for me, and only one company has everything under the same roof. That company also happens to make some of the best hardware there is. So... I'm in.

The next iPhone announcement happens on Wednesday. I'm going to be watching. How about that.

Motto: **Hey/Okay Siri/Alexa/Cortana/Google, are you hearing me?**  

  
Technology is _cool_.  
  
I think we are on the cusp of a cool, new, and exciting future in the world of consumer tech. \#BoldPrediction  
  
It used to be that geeks thought "some day soon, everyone will have a PC".   
Then it was "some day soon, everyone will be on the internet".   
Then it was "some day soon, everyone will have a smartphone".   
Now I think some day soon, everyone will have a smart home. More than that, a smart _everything_.   
  
I expect most people already have at LEAST 3 of the following items:  
* computer
* smartphone
* tablet
* smart TV &/or streaming box &/or gaming console
* smart wearable device (smart watch, fitness tracker, etc)
* internet-connected car
* internet-connected speakers
* any number of smart "home automation" devices (smart thermostat, smart lights, surveillance camera, etc)
* Amazon's "Echo", which is really a new category of device
I think that **the next big thing will be the connection of those pieces**... intelligently organized and orchestrated through cloud services. You'll see product categories like Amazon's always-listening personal assistance "Echo" device become more common. All of these "smart" products will learnt to behave and interoperate with one-another under a common language, accessible from any of your various devices. Let's explore this using the following hypothetical situation:  

> _You wake up to the smell of fresh-brewed coffee. Your coffee maker is hooked into your phone's alarm so it knows when you're about to wake up and has a pot ready for you. You go to the bathroom and weigh yourself as you get ready for work. Your scale reports your weight to your phone. You make breakfast with the television on. It flips through the latest photos you've taken on your phone or edited on your computer. You're looking at your tablet to see your calendar for the week and notice your latest fitness metrics as measured on your wearable device and your scale are both pointing in a negative direction. You use your watch to make a reminder to work out on Saturday. Noticing the time, you ask the room "does my car need gas?". Your always listening device pings your car for that information and relays the response through your connected speakers. You do need gas, so you have to leave for work a little bit early. Work is crazy busy. You barely have time to use the bathroom, much less stand in a line for lunch. You order a burrito by tapping your wrist so you can skip the line when you get there. After lunch, a package you ordered is delivered to your place. Your phone alerts you that someone is at your door. You're able to greet the delivery man, unlock the door, have him leave the package inside, then re-lock it as he leaves. You were excited for this package, so you decide to come home early. Your phone notifies you there's been automobile accident on your normal route home and automatically reroutes you around traffic. Your phone then sends a message to your thermostat to start cooling down the house in preparation for your arrival._ 

All of those things are **very** possible with today's tech. The only thing is needed is a little bit of coordination between services. If Google's "On Hub" router becomes an always-listening "Google Now" device, if you have an Android Auto car, Android Wear device, Android phone, Chromecast/Android TV, and a computer with a Google account, you could do almost all of those things. If you have AT&T's "Digital Life", a Nest thermostat & dropcam, a "Ring" video doorbell, or really any other sufficient home-automation setup, this is all within the realm of immediate possibility... and that's cool.  
  
I predict that these things will become more and more common place. It will slowly become just an assumed part of any home. Realtors will have to specify when a home does NOT support wide automation. That's my \#BoldPrediction.   
  
What an exciting time we live in.

2\. While driving, tilt my wrist "Okay Google, text my wife I'll be home in 5 minutes".  
1\. When my cloud-based spreadsheet pulls in weather information according to my location, my weight readings according to my internet-connected scale, my walking metrics & heart rate from the little watch/computer strapped to my wrist, my nutritional intake according to an app/web service I use, and my financial information from another app/web service I use... all automatically.

Motto: ...THERE'S NEVER "TOO MUCH" TO SAY ABOUT THE MCU  
  
First, a quick aside about some English stuff.  
  
**Active voice:** Thing A performs this action to Thing B. Active voice is frowned upon.  
**Passive voice:** Thing B has this action performed on it. I use passive voice too much.  
  
_A quick aside from a quick aside before I start talking Marvel stuff - what you just witnessed is a brand of Aaron humor that I dub "only funny to me & would make people who don't know better assume that I am stupid". This specific example was me saying "Active voice is frowned upon" using passive voice. Then me saying "I use passive voice too much" using active voice. It's funny to me because, if somebody did that on accident - it would make me laugh. So I do it on purpose but don't (normally) call attention to the fact that I did it, but have some dumb goofy grin on my face like I'm some sort of comedy genius... and people don't understand what's so funny._  
  
Back to my original aside.  
**That:** Sometimes the word "that" is necessary. Sometimes it is not.   
Soccer is a game **that** I don't understand.  
Soccer is a game I don't understand.  
Have I told you **that** baseball is boring?  
Have I told you baseball is boring?  
Can't you see **that that** game has no appeal to me?  
~~Can't you see game has no appeal to me?~~  
  
That's curious.  
Curious.  
  
Dord is a word.  
  
ALRIGHT! End of the English section.  
  
The biggest, most life-changing thing since I got married happened to me in the past 3 days...  
  
  
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!  
  
How **good** was that trailer!?  
  
Look at this dude!

Recently, MCU-mastermind/executive-producer/should-be-richest-dude-ever Kevin Feige did [an interview with Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/marvel-cover-story) in which he says _“There will be two distinct periods. Everything before Avengers 4 and everything after. I know it will not be in ways people are expecting”_   
  
Well here's what I'm expecting:  
  
**Avengers: Infinity War**  
The movie opens with Thanos encountering Thor and the remnants of Agsard. Thanos wrecks Thor and takes the Tesseract off Loki. He uses the Space Stone to go to Xandar, wrecking the Xandarians at their own HQ and takes the Power Stone. Thanos then opens up a portal into New York City to get the Time Stone from Doctor Strange and the Mind Stone from the Vision. I EXPECT there's a chance Thanos will only succeed in getting one and the Avengers will drive him away... what I HOPE is that Thanos succeeds fully. Kills off a bunch of the main Avengers cast (e.g. Captain America), then leaves on his own to finish collecting the Reality Stone & the Soul Stone, leaving Earth devastated and down many of its Mightiest Heroes. The razing of Earth either awakens Captain Marvel or signals her to return to Earth.  
  
**Ant-Man and the Wasp**  
I don't have any idea what's going to happen in this movie. It will serve as comedic relief from the dour previous movie. I don't know how it will fit into the supernarrative.  
**Captain Marvel**  
I am really looking forward to this movie. I have always liked Brie Larson since she was Scott Pilgrim's popstar ex girlfriend. This movie is supposedly set in the 1990's. So I imagine it will just tell an interesting story about how she got her powers and end with a rational explanation of why she's not been around thus far, but WILL be around for Avengers 4.  
  
**Avengers 4**   
Thanos manages to get the Reality Stone or the Soul Stone. The remaining Marvel heroes (Avengers or otherwise) use whatever Stone is left to bring back Captain America and company to make their final stand against a nearly full-power Thanos. Thanos kills basically everyone, but for some reason loses. I don't know how you defeat someone who's basically God, but obviously he can't win. Whoever is still alive will have then full Infinity Gauntlet and will use it to undo the atrocities of the Infinity War. Marvel will then accomplish an in-canon universe reset. From there, anything can happen... and what's happened already isn't invalidated.  
  
After the events of Avengers 4, I think that Marvel will have bought their rights back to Fantastic Four, and possibly even the X-Men. The NEXT 10 years of Marvel movies will focus on those properties and the others we haven't seen much of yet. We'll have new actors playing new heroes. The days of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and Bruce Banner's the Hulk will be done. It will be a whole new Marvel Cinematic Universe.  
  
And it will be great.

Motto: EVERYTHING IS SO NEW AND SHINY

  
I took a week off. Life happens. I'm going to make this update into 3 short updates in one.  

Today I am writing exclusively about Battlefield 4, Android 4.4, and the Nexus 5\. I'm going to tackle them in that order. Each will begin with an image and end with a Top 5 Features section. Feel free to skip anything you don't have any interest reading about.

  
[![](assets/128-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ue3DId-ccLc/UnKw9K0uyXI/AAAAAAABCeQ/xWc-MT2w1L4/s1600/%23128+-+Battlefield+4.jpg)

  
I don't write much about videogames and, truthfully, I don't play them all that often. Both of those things are temporarily changing thanks to Battlefield 4\. 

  
A little over 2 years ago Battlefield 3 came out. Since that time, I've played it more than I've played any other single game. I've held it up as the golden standard of videogaming. I always thought it was perfect, and couldn't be improved on in any way. Two days ago, it's sequel came out and proved me wrong.

  
Battlefield 4 is amazing. It's fantastic. It's been one week since it came out and, at the risk of sounding like a horrible person, I've already played it for 28 hours. I've played it an average of 4.2 hours a day for the past 6 days... and I regret nothing. It's so fun.

  
Top 5: New Features in Battlefield 4

5\. Additional customization options - every time I get in a tank or a boat, a little Android emblem is on the side. Little things like that.  
4\. Squad based perk system - your perks are directly linked to how well you perform as a squad. It's a huge incentive to play Battlefield the way it was meant to be played - as a team.  
3\. The Commander - a team leader providing constant support and direction. I have yet to lose a match under the direction of a commander. Basically, when you have a coach, your team plays better. When the iPad and Android Commander application drops, I think we'll see huge improvements on the quality of game play.  
2\. Levelotion - how you play changes the maps. Bust a levee to flood the map, bring down a skyscraper, each level features some big, level-changing event that the players can trigger.  
1\. Battlelog integration _\-_ the ability to make changes on your phone/tablet/computer and see those changes take place in real time on your gaming console. This feature is changing how I look at the game more than any other.  
  
  
[![](assets/128-2.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UbXxv9NXb8o/UnKxLMmfk5I/AAAAAAABCeY/U%5F3WLh49%5Fv0/s1600/%23128+-+Android+4.4.jpg)

  
Google announced Android 4.4 - "Kitkat". The new operating system brings with it a slew on new features and a few visual and functional changes. Overall, it ended up being a much bigger update than most people seemed to anticipate.   
  
The Nexus 4 that I have sitting on a wireless charger right next to me is still running 4.3 and has never felt older. It should get the update within a week or two (probably several days after Melissa's gets it, if the past is any indication).  
  
  
Top 5: New Features in Android 4.4

5\. Visual tweaks - the notification area and soft navigation buttons are now translucent instead of fully opaque. There is a new condensed typeface that is sprinkled throughout the system.  
4\. Various core app improvements - rather than detail them all (partially because I don't _have_ any of them yet) I'm just going to leave it at that.  
3\. Revamped homescreen - way back in the day, stock Android had 3 home screens. The middle home screen was your main one and you could fill them as you pleased. If you didn't fill them, they were just left blank. Later, they raised that number to 5, but otherwise it behaved the same way. Now, the number of home screens is determined by the end user and the main home screen is the left-most one.  
2\. Lower memory requirements - making future "budget phones" more likely to be paired with a more modern version of Android instead of the Android 2.whatever days of yore.  
1\. Now with more Google Now - the sleeper killer feature of Android 4.2 was the introduction of Google Now. It wasn't much of a big deal at first, but years later turned out to be the thing that update was remembered by. Google Now is more highlighted, easier to get to, and takes a more central role than ever.

New versions of Android have long been announced alongside new pieces of Nexus hardware. "Nexus" devices are the devices Google had made to demonstrate a "pure Android experience". Last year, alongside Android 4.2, the Nexus 4 was announced to much fanfare. This year came the Nexus 5\. It 1-ups the Nexus 4 on literally every front - and manages to do so at the same insanely cheap price point.  
  
Again, the Nexus 4 that I have sitting on a wireless charger right next to me has never felt older. Maybe Christmas.
  
  
Top 5: New Features in the Nexus 5

5\. The big & beautiful display - 4.95" 1080p.  
4\. Active listening - this feature was HUGE and I was REALLY excited for it until I found out one stipulation. Unlike the Moto X, the screen has to be on for the phone to respond to your voice.  
3\. LTE - _this_ Nexus actually supports LTE. That's nice!  
2\. The camera - optical image stabilization for excellent low-light performance capabilities, at least when compared to the Nexus 4\. A new HDR+ mode that people seem very impressed by. Overall, the shots I've seen uploaded are much, much better than the phone has been given credit for.  
1\. The price - just $350 off-contract. I no longer understand any appeal toward phones on contract. There are _excellent_ phones that can be had for cheap without any strings attached.

Motto: Cars Go Fast

  
This Column is long, but I think it's more interesting than my average post. Don't be offput by the following wall of text.

  
In the last 20 years communications technology has advanced with a screaming pace. 20 year ago today, we had a landline in each household along with a phonebook and everyone got a newspaper to get the news. Today, each person has their own phone that they carry with them. That phone gives them access to the biggest, fastest growing library of information ever collected known as "the Internet". Now let's look at transportation: 20 years ago today, Ford made an f150 truck that got around 18 miles to the gallon and could tow 15000 pounds. Today, Ford makes an f150 truck that gets around 19 miles to the gallon and can tow 15000 pounds.This is just ONE vehicle, but it represents the point I'm trying to make. The improvements we've seen in transportation have been anything but awe-inspiring. More like "ahh" than awe. Where's our hoverboards? Where's our teleporters? We Were Promised Jetpacks! The most basic, fundamental reason humans need transportation is because things are in different places... and we need to move people and stuff between these things. The problem is this: our transportation methods suck. Almost all the way across the board, they suck. They are **inefficient**, **resource hungry**, **bad for the environment**, **dangerous**, and **in general, don't impress me**. Automobiles in particular... suck. Let me expand upon that: **Inefficient:** The purpose of a vehicle is to move its **passengers** and **cargo** from here to there. The point of a vehicle is **_not_** to move the **vehicle** from here to there, that's just a characteristic of how vehicles work. At my heaviest, I weigh about 225 lbs. According to the Goog, my car weighs a bit over 3375 lbs, but we'll use that number because it makes things round. The combined weight of my car and me is 3600 lbs. My car weighs 15 times more than me. That means that I use 15 times MORE gasoline moving my CAR down the road than I do moving myself. Using these numbers, 93.75% of the fuel I use is going towards moving the vehicle I'm in (which is **_not_** the point) from here to there, while only 6.25% of the fuel I use is going towards moving **me** (which _**is**_ the point). Now let's generalize that a bit. Taking average numbers I found online, then inserting margins of error to find the BEST CASE SCENARIO (maximize cargo weight to vehicle weight ratio) - Average # occupants per car: 1.3 people, we'll use 1.5 Average weight of a human in the US: 180 lbs, we'll use 200 lbs Average weight of an automobile in the US: 4000 lbs Average weight of an automobile + its average passenger load: 4300 lbs Let's be generous and assume there's 100 pounds of non-human cargo in any given car (groceries, a bike, your cat, whatever) - average weight of an automobile + its average cargo: 4400 lbs. % fuel toward moving the automobile: 91% % fuel toward moving the cargo: 9% So then, automobiles are 9% efficient? Not even close. Depending on where you read, modern internal combustion engines have peak efficiencies around 25-30%. So that 9% is more like 2%. But that's **peak** efficiency. Take into account **average** efficiency and you're looking at efficiencies closer to 1%. So, of that gallon of gasoline you just bought for $3.69 (the nationwide average as of today), 4 cents of that ACTUALLY went toward moving you and your cargo from here to there. The other $3.65 was wasted. Makes you kind of not want to drive anywhere anymore, doesn't it? **Resource hungry:**

Automobiles use oil. The US alone used an estimated 1.345 billion gallons of oil in year 2013 alone. That's a pool nearly a half mile wide by a half mile long by a half mile deep. That volume is approximately equal to the total volume of all humans alive on planet earth.  
  
The infrastructure needed to support automobiles (roads) use vast amounts of real estate. There is about 61000 square miles of road surface area in the United States. Thats an area slightly bigger than Georgia and slightly smaller than Wisconsin. Those are all natural resources... but automobiles are also resource intensive on a personal level. Vehicles are expensive. More likely than not, your car is either the first or second most expensive thing you own (depending if you own your home). The average price of a new car today is over $30,000\. You then have to get insurance. The average insurance payments in the United States varies wildly from state to state, but it's probably around $1500/year ($125/month). So, if you own your new car for 5 years. You're paying $7500 just to keep in insured. $30000 + $7500 = $37500\. Did you want to drive your car? Because that's going to take gasoline. The average person drives between 12000 and 15000 miles per year. We'll go on the low side of that and just say 12000\. As I said before, the average price of gasoline in America right now is $3.69\. Let's pretend gasoline won't get more expensive and just say you're paying $3.69/gallon. In 2013, the average fuel economy of all vehicles sold is estimated to be 23 miles per gallon. We'll say your car is a little better than average, 25 mpg. 12000 miles/year / 25 miles/gallon = 480 gallons/year 480 gallons x $3.96/gallon = $1900/year $1900/year x 5 years = $9500\. $30000 + $7500 + $9500 = $47000 Then there's maintenance, taxes, and the other logistics of owning a car that I haven't already spelled out. I've read that you should budget "around $100/month" for maintenance cost of your car alone, but that number varies wildly. So lets aim really low and say that you'll only pay $1000 year for everything else. That's another $5000\. $30000 + $7500 + $9500 + $5000 = $52,000 That's an estimate of car ownership over a 5 year period using conservative numbers. That sucks. **Bad for the environment:** I'm not going to write at length about this because everybody knows cars are bad for the environment. They pollute. The are a contributing factor to global warming. Telling you cars are bad for the environment will only serve to bore you. Instead - let me talk about solar power for a second. I said before that roads take up an 61000 mi^2 area in the United States. You'd only need 2000 square miles of solar panels to produce enough electricity to power the United States. There's an interesting movement to have roads paved with solar panels. It makes sense the more you think about it. Roads go from place to place. Places need electricity. Urban areas need more electricity and have more roads. Simple idea. Impossible implementation. So, there's that. **Dangerous:** I'm having a difficult time finding hard numbers on this one. Also, despite the fact this is kind of a random spot in the middle of the Column, it's actually the LAST thing I'm writing for this post and I'm running out of patience. But, car accidents are the cause of just over 2% of deaths. 1 out of every 50 people you know will die thanks to a "road traffic accident". 

**In general, don't impress me:**

The last thing I'd like to talk about regarding transportation is people's obsession with motor vehicles. I don't get cars. Cars don't impress me.  Here's the way I see things - as I've already stated, the point of an automobile is to move you (and maybe some of your stuff) from here to there. A $20,000 car can move you and your stuff from here to there just as well as a $80,000 car, or $150,000 car, or a $1500 junker. They perform the exact same function and, assuming the vehicle is capable of driving the speed limit, they all do so equally well. More expensive cars tend to have one to a few things going for them out of a set of "good" traits for cars: Crazy acceleration Crazy top speed Crazy power Those three things can all kind of be summarized under the category of "crazy performance capabilities". The situations that call for those capabilities are usually far and few between (the exception being crazy power, if you own a trailer or something). Utilizing your crazy speed and crazy acceleration is illegal on both counts. And, ultimately, no matter what, you're only taking yourself and your cargo from point A to point B. My car does the exact same thing. If your car goes "faster", whoopdee doo. **The limiting factor of getting from point A to point B is the laws governing the road, _not_ the performance capability of the automobile.** If you don't care about those laws and want to drive 120 mph, be my guest, idiot. Just don't do it on any road I drive on. If somebody owns a really cool car. I can say "this guy appreciates really cool cars", but I'm not impressed. I've never been all that moved by any vehicle I've ever seen on the road (that was a pun). So long as my car gets me from here to there at around the speed limit, turns on and runs consistently, has good safety features, and has a comfortable ride (headroom, air conditioner, and radio that I can hook my phone into), I'll be just fine 

  
/end rant.

Having said everything I just said - I can **intellectually** understand the appeal of a hotshot sweet ride. I just can't **emotionally** appreciate it. If you are a car person, that is totally and completely okay. I have no beef with you. More power to you. It's a perfectly valid interest/hobby. I just won't ever really be able to appreciate anything you say on the subject like you'd want me to, just like you wouldn't probably truly appreciate Marvel movies and computer stuff and other stuff I like. Wake me up when the self-driving cars start to take human hands off the wheel. Wake me up when the road is full of electric vehicles. I won't be impressed until I can plug coordinates into my automobile, fresh off a change from a wind turbine, solar panels, or some other naturally renewable energy source, and it will automatically and safely take me to where I want to go. My eyes, ears, body, and mind free to do with what I please. I'll be impressed at that point, but probably not much until then. 

  
Hopefully that's something I'll see in my lifetime. That's my take on transportation. **Interesting things I learned while researching/writing this Column:** I have a hybrid car. It's lighter than most cars. Also, I'm heavier than most people. My energy efficiency is slightly better than average. The efficiency of 1 average person and no cargo in an average vehicle was less than 5%. Mine was 6.25%. Cool. I weigh about the same as two average Vietnamese people. A liter of unleaded gasoline has about 7650 calories in it. If your body was capable of digesting and metabolising gasoline, one Liter would sustain you for over 3 days. A gallon would get you over one and a half weeks. The Top 5 regards energy efficiency in different modes of transportation. You'll notice I assign everything a unit of "miles per gallon", even things like "walking". That might not make much sense at first, but think about it this way: a "gallon" of gasoline contains a fixed amount of energy. Walking burns calories in the exact same way that driving burns gasoline energy. The two things are directly comparable. To get the MPG, I just Googled how many calories you burn doing different physical activities, then extrapolated out to miles per gallon. The Top 5 uses the following two assumptions: 1\. A gallon of gasoline contains 31000 dietary calories = 123000 BTU = 130 megajoules = 36 kilowatt hours. This number was quoted across several websites. Other websites listed similar numbers.

2\. You weigh 180 lbs and are capable of using each item listed below with at least an average competency.

  
Top 15: Most Energy Efficient Modes of Personal Transportation

15\. M1 Abrams Tank - 0.6 mpg 14\. Truck - 14 mpg 13\. SUV - 15 mpg 12\. Car - 24 mpg 11\. Prius (2014 Prius) - 50 mpg 10\. Motorcycle (2014 Harley Davidson Lowrider) - 51 mpg 9\. Scooter (2014 LX 150 IE Vespa) - 75 mpg 8\. Tesla Model S - 95 mpg 7\. Electric Smart car - 107 mpg 6\. Swimming (1 mph) - 150 mpg 5\. Running (6 mph) - 237 mpg  
4\. Walking (4 mph) - 295 mpg 3\. Bicycle (13 mph) - 565 mpg 2\. Recumbent Bicycle - 632 mpg 1\. Velomobile - 1500+ mpg

# Motto: Practice makes perfect.

I am officially back home. I'm not sure for how long, though. I am here until after Melissa gets home and I can do some soul searching. That is also dependent on the whole job situation, which I expect to be set in stone by this time next week. 

In the meantime, I am going to do a little rearranging of my living space here. This started last night when I disassembled the fooseball table and freed up that corner. I drew up a desk for the new nook. With watchful pointers from the old man, I cut and crafted my original design to near-perfection. The biggest fitting/design/construction error I've seen is a 1/8th inch gap in a cosmetic board. Oh, and my spraypaint job sucked. I consider this practice. Practice for designing and building useful things for the rest of my life. It's not very sophisticated, but it's something.

The desk is getting some final post-build revisions tomorrow morning. My next post will show the final product all loaded up with what it was designed to hold. So... look forward to that.

Still no California updates. Seeking a meetup with my 2nd cousin. If I can get that to work out, I'll be visiting two people you could find on IMDB. No big deal. If I'm not famous by association by the time I get back it will be some sort of a tragedy.

This is the follow-up to [#435](https://aarongilly.com/435/). I have officially, **finally**, wrapped up active development on my most recent *(and hopefully last)* complete, bottom-up re-write of my Life Tracker/Personal Data Warehouse. This post is about that Project and what it’s been like to keep pretty good tabs on the last 10+ years of my life.

So strap in or bail out now.

# 10 Years Tracked

I’ve already written several[^1] times describing “The Life Tracker” before, so I’ll skip some of the pleasantries. Here’s it in a 🥜:

<aside style="padding: 1em; background-color:#333; color: white;"> 🥜 I have developed & iterated on a quantified self, life-tracking project for more than 10 years now. It includes data about my life, health, and other things I find interesting.</aside>

This post is a brief celebration and retrospective on having hit the 10 year mark. 

## Growing Pains

Out the gate I did a pretty good job of organizing the system. My goals were well thought out. I iterated on how the system worked where I found deficiencies. I developed an increasingly well-honed system... up until the 5-year anniversary. I then spent 5 years in tinker town trying to make something that seems *incredibly simple* on the surface work out.

![[444-1.jpg]]

It turns out **cardinality** is one of the single hardest concepts to engineer a system around.

5 years ago, in order to satisfy my desire to track some things that may happen multiple times per day *(e.g. movies I watched)*, I decided to grow beyond my “everything in one big spreadsheet” system. I’ll be honest, I’m pretty sure it was better before it got so complicated. That problem could have been solved with orders of magnitude less effort & fewer lines of code.

If I hadn't gone through the pain, I wouldn't have grown. I would have learned way less.

## Current Tracking Targets

I've tracked well over one hundred different types of things over the past 10 years. Here's what I'm still tracking today:

- Nightly review
    - Textual summary of the day
    - Satisfaction
    - Health Status
- 🤖 Sleep location (city)
- 🤖 Sleep stats
    - bed time
    - wake time
    - time in bed
    - time asleep
- 🤖 Started driving (city)
- Drinks (soda, alcohol, energy drinks)
- Movies
- TV
- Videogames
- Date nights
- Saw family
- Saw friends
- Eating out
- 🤖 Forecast (expected high, low, rain, & wind)
- Pains & Treatments
- Place in Lawrence we visit
- New experiences
- Workouts
- 🤖 Runs & walks
- Quotes
- 🤖 Weight

Everything marked wit the 🤖 robot is tracked wholly passively through automations. Mostly using the iOS Shortcut app automations. Every single other tracking element *other* than the Nightly Review I can track using just my voice using Siri Shortucts (or online, whatever).

# The Largest Coding Project Ever

This rewrite took a **while**. Frankly, way longer than I expect. Way longer than I was afraid of. Longer than I would have ever even **imagined**.

The process itself was arduous. In all, I wrote:
- A TypeScript library - now [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdw)
- 3 Plugins - two of which are [also on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdw?activeTab=dependents)
- A new website, [pdw.one](https://pdw.one) built on SvelteKit - front end and back end
- Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 lines of code[^2], dozens of classes & components
- 3 UML Models - one of which was almost helpful
- 46 pages of hand drawn notes & plans in GoodNotes
- Several iterations of documentation for how things worked, all of which were scrapped eventually

I’m not planning on writing about “how it all works” here. [I just added this page explaining how it works in more detail](https://aarongilly.com/pdw/). 

## Desired Difficulty

There’s such a thing as “desired difficulty”. As anyone who’s ever used an invincibility cheat code in a video game will tell you, if things are too easy they lose their fun. If you aren’t struggling some, then there’s no meaning behind it all.

If this had all been an app I downloaded then blindly followed, there's no chance I'd still be using it 10 years later. The pursuit of building this has been my longest surviving hobby, behind this blog you're reading now.

That said, I'm very ready to move onto what's next.

You'll hear more about the Life Tracker some other day. But hopefully not for a while.



# Top 5: A Decade of Charts!



## 6. Media

Tracking media is a large part of the reason I wanted to start tracking things that happen might happen multiple times per day. While I don’t have a **decade** of data for these, I do have 5 years. Which is still a ton.

### Movies

![[444-2.png]]

My movie watching has died off since I started tracking. I used to watch a movie every 5 days or so, now I’m down to a couple times a month. This includes Netflix and Video-on-Demand type movies, but does not include movies I put on for my kids to watch that I’m not really watching. My re-watching of movies I’ve already seen before has gone waaay down.

### Television

Television I never really figured out “how” I wanted to track. If I binged something like “Squid Game” in one night, do I want to track that I had one session of watching Squid Game, or do I want to track the number of episodes of Squid Game? Or the *time spent* watching Squid Game? I wound up doing what was easiest, and just tracking sessions. Some of these were multiple episodes, some were not. But the gross trend is about right, less television overall:

![[444-3.png]]

I couldn’t find a more elegant way to present those data. That’s a screen grab from [pdw.one](http://pdw.one).

Hey every year I’ve watched a least one sports game. Sports!

### Videogames

I’m not a big video gamer, it turns out.

![[444-4.png]]

The only real takeaway here is that I play video games about 50 times a year, except when I started playing Super Smash Brothers online in 2020. 

I wish I found an easy method to track the amount of time played in each game. The Switch has *some* functionality for that, but nothing I can easily tap into.

## 5. Weight

![[444-5.png]]

Honestly there’s not a ton to see here. My weight’s never been too dramatic. I included my min & max measures from each year to give a sense of range, but mostly cause otherwise this is a boring chart. Included because I figure most people would probably track this, so it would be a conspicuous absence.



## 4. Travel

![[444-6.png]]

I track where I sleep each night as a proxy for travel. My phone wakes up at 3:30AM, pings my location & sends it to the cloud. For some reason, in 2022, I *really* stayed at home. That’s >20 days at home for every 1 day out. Crazy. Glad to see I'm trending up in 2023 - and the holidays haven't even begun yet.



## 3. Sleep

![[444-7.png]]

Aside from sleep *location*, I’ve tracked several other aspects of my sleep throughout the years. Before I bought an Oura ring in August 2019 my dataset was limited to when I went to bed, when I woke up, and the number of minutes that elapsed in between. Looking at “time in bed” (above), things look pretty consistent. 

![[444-8.png]]

...since buying the Oura ring I’ve had access to time actually spent *sleeping*. This shows that, pretty consistently, don’t actually *sleep* for 45 minutes to 1 hour of the time I’m in bed. Interestingly, the birth of my first child corresponded with much less time in bed, but the birth of the second child corresponded with a permanent *increase* in my time spent in bed. Probably because two kids makes you tired.

![[444-9.png]]

Mostly for pseudo-completeness, that’s the standard deviation of the time I spent in bed. For those of you who didn’t pay attention in stats class, standard deviation is a measure of how “spread out” the data are. The smaller the standard deviation, the closer we’d expect a typical data point to be to the mean. **TL;DR** - I’m getting more consistent with my bedtime since the birth of my boys.



## 2. Workouts by Type

![[444-10.png]]

My interest in exercise jumped hard from 2015 to 2016, but aside from that has more or less stayed pretty consistent. I took up more yoga in 2020 and 2021 to make up for the lack of *sports* during the pandemic. I’m happy to say that the 2023 line is on pace to rival 2016 for my most active year.



## 1. Summary

Every night I write down a few sentences about how I used my day and how I'm feeling. It's the most valuable thing I do. I can see “on this day” for the past 10 years of my life. There's no way to summarize these data in a way that's interesting or appropriate for public release. It's there, and it's the most valuable thing in all of this. 

I do, however, have something to share. Each night I also rank how satisfied I was with the day on a scale from 1 to 10, and how my current health is doing. It's probably the work of The Hedonic Treadmill, but my daily satisfaction rankings have not changed much since I started capturing them.

![[444-11.png]]

I do get progressively more satisifed with my days as the week goes. I think this result is probably typical. On a related note - tomorrow is Monday.

![[444-12.png]]

...and checking for seasonal affective disorder... no I think I'm good. I get less healthy through the summer, that was surprising - but it's mostly in the noise.

![[444-13.png]]

And that's all that's fit for public release.

# Motto: So it goes.

Sitting alone in my room - at my desk, specifically.
Waiting for a witch's broom to take me trans-Pacifically.
I will see my girl on the other side of the world.

How about that for terrible poetry? Actually, I prefer the term "wordplay" over poetry - "poetry" is supposed to be pretty. 

How about that for terrible wordplay?

Last night I fell asleep before 10:30 for the first time since... well... I don't know. This morning I woke up with vim and vigor at 6:15. That's been my goal "wake up" time for months and I've never really been very successful. I suppose I did everything right last night. Turned my computer off at 9. Read a book outside for half an hour. Cleaned my place. Flopped like a fish into bed at 10-oh-something. Told Melissa goodnight and put my phone away.

It was beautiful outside, by the way.

Slaughterhouse 5 on the Balcony of My Building
One sentence about consumer technology: The 7 inch tablet form factor is easily my favorite personal-media consumption form factor.

I feel so grown up - sitting on the desk next to me is my Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, Passport, Tax information, information about my insurance policies, and one or two other things of equal magnitude.

At the same time, I feel so not grown up - also sitting on the desk next to me is my PlayStation, a rubber ducky, a DVD of "Hot Rod" with Andy Samberg, and my desktop background says "Rule 1. You do not talk about Fight Club".

You met me at a very strange time in my life.

# Top 5: Changes in Version 2 of my 'Demetri List'
5. "Cut Down on Multitasking" has been completely removed. Mutlitasking hasn't been a problem for months.
4. Reading was introduced to the list because I didn't do nearly enough of it.
3. "Slept 7.5 Hours" as split into two goals concerning my bed and wake times. This was to add emphasis.
2. "Wrote a Column" and "Worked on a Project" were combined, because I used to consider writing a Column as 'working on a project' anyway. Redundancies are redundant.
1. Overall, more precise definitions for goals. For example: "Drank water" became "Drank > 2 liters water".

It's the end of another year. Let's review...

# Themes of the Year

## 2021 ⇒ 2020 All Over Again?

Blah blah blah pandemic.

At this point it's annoying and boring to talk about how the on-going COVID-19 pandemic has affected everything in every domain. The year *continued* to be dominated by the influence of COVID-19 in every possible location. At this point every business has either figured out how to live with it, or they've already failed. We’ve all lived with it. It’s affected everything. This is me acknowledging that fact. Moving on.

## We Moved House

This will be a recurring theme. The biggest event that happened this year was us relocating from a suburb of Kansas City to a new home in lovely Lawrence, Kansas. It happened in August, and it changed **everything** about how we operate. It’s been a huge huge undertaking that massively knocked a lot of things off-track... and I regret none of it.

The move really threw everything that was working well out the window. I stopped exercising. I stopped playing guitar. I stopped having free time for stuff like, say, maintaining a website. It is something we’re slowly working our way out of, the new year will help with that transition. Also the fact that we went HARD on the house over break[^1]. 

I wrote about this in my previous post. I’m still re-discovering things I used to do that worked really well that I’d forgotten about. This is a front I'm actively working on.

## ...Not Much Else

Really nothing much else comes to mind to share when I think “2021 was the year of _____”. 

I guess you could say 2021 was the year of family, but I don’t expect that 2022 (or any year thereafter) will be much different, so it feels wrong to write 2021 was “The Year of Family”. My wife and I spent countless hours with our kids and each other, and that's exactly what I wanted.

# THIS YEAR IN THE OBJECTIVE

I set out some pretty black-and-white goals for myself for 2021. Checking my report card now... yeesh. 

| Goal | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 🔴 Purchase an Overseas Trip | Didn’t happen. |
| 🔴 Take a Couples Vacation | Didn’t happen. |
| 🔴 Eat Out <53 Times | I ate out 120 times. Was essentially on track for success until we moved, which means we’ve eaten out a scary amount since then. |
| 🔴 Log 156 Workouts | Finished 115. Was on track before the move. |
| 🔴 Post 18 Gillespedia Articles | 2 |
| 🟡 Post 18 Columns | 11 |
| 🟡 Log 250 Guitar Practice Sessions | Logged 214. Was on track until we moved. |
| 🟡 Finish my free audit of a MIT Systems Engineering Course  | Got about 1/2 done. I did take a Systems Engineering course for Credit from Georgia Tech, though. |
| 🟡 Integrate all “Data Journal” data | About 75% complete. I haven’t yet reached my desired end-state of a portable, extensible, queryable “Personal Data Warehouse”. |
| 🟢 Watch 26 New Movies | Finished exactly 26. |
| 🟢 Read 26 Books | Finished 27. Started and stopped an additional 4. |
| 🟢 Complete 52 Creations-of-the-Weeks | Success! |
| 🟢 Take a Family Vacation | Success (several times) |
| 🟢 See the Grandparents 20 Times | Saw them >50 times |
| 🟢 Decide on Next Living Situation | Massive Success (...he wrote sitting in the kitchen of his new house in his new city) |
| 🟢 Buy a New Car | It’s reserved... but not yet actually here. Credit given. |
| 🟢 Create 150 New Notes | 232 new notes added (and 114 older notes were updated) |

More along these lines in the Top 5, below.

# THIS YEAR IN THE SUBJECTIVE

Honestly I don’t want/need to go on forever about how I feel about this year. Here’s the best way to sum it up

I may not have accomplished all my goals. I may have some enduring challenges that very much remain on my plate for 2022. But neither of those things stopped this year from being perfect. At multiple points this year I thought to myself “this is what life is about. I hope my life flashes before my eyes whenever I die so I can see this moment again.”

If you’re thinking that, you’re living right.

# Looking Forward to 2022

My goals for 2022 aren’t perfectly lined out yet. Right now I’m thinking they will be more modest, both in terms of number and difficulty. Some more on that in the Top 5, below.

Some non-SMART goals:

More time listening to music, less to podcasts.

Re-establish the hardcore use of Streaks on iOS. 

Hone my work systems.

Make the generation of the quantified yearly results for next year (and subsequent years) easier by integrating all the various versions of my “Life Tracker/Data Journal/Personal Data Warehouse” into a single, cohesive project.



# Top 5: **Quantified Results of 2021 & Goals for 2022**



## 5. Times Eaten Out - 120

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUTAbokP27aXC5sJc6taHrrBOxzbNeSldJkS9P1ITRnXWpx9p2GSrU4GmzWKaKn1QyQyqaFMYlYNJXkwMzqiMU7wFPXATRmbhX1qAWM3XnXtkQ7IeyP81jjcjGZzx86qoxXOladFSaYVfzSyXN61veo_w=w703-h335-no?authuser=0](assets/415-1.jpg)

This is much higher than last year (when COVID was new) and well above my original goal for 2021 of eating out once/week. We weren’t *terribly* behind pace until after we moved in early August. 

In the name of moderance, I’ll only set the goal for 2022 to eating out 2x/week (104 meals).



## 4. Named Workouts - 115

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLU0BqP3N4K7xozUZhw6bTvJrDdIZ6tcJH-oQey1R2bWFQayqwGzv_h6wVUoDMaJSRZhdPQkCaIER281icfGi7gwYuSqTZ7WNWLJooJfJZV7ZdHz3kMU-HjUKLVO_vS6W0DF29WpFTw4GoYxS8dgvs_97g=w578-h384-no?authuser=0](assets/415-2.jpg)

Again you see a massive hit after we moved in August. Weirdly July was super light, and August itself was my heaviest hitting month of all. Odd result.

This is basically on par with my average annual workout count over the past 9 years:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLW1Dwb5yxhWXp-R5Qa5xxJTKLPbjXSnzhGms_nswtU1abq-0EydM35A18WhzRJszbzDdfeoGXEW6PmDje0BIKjLYJ5gaDDgWIwlBadhXqHdP5coFqF3XnCwljwJLp7iaexY7uWxRopMvJZYA5BBN-mW-w=w644-h395-no?authuser=0](assets/415-3.jpg)

Next year I want my workout count to be greater than my eating out count. That’s good motivation both ways I think.



## 3. Sleep - Many Metrics

In 2021, I spent 7.9 hours in bed each night, but only slept 6.9 of those hours. On an “average” night I slept from 11:37pm to 7:27am. This is much later on both fronts than my previous years’ results. Not sure why I slipped later in the day. Maybe cause I’m writing this at 12:34am.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWjThOvo90M9ZouAw0JR4occioqrVbimTCCRMghtjsBWUZr_SLYCnDBzPffZYg1cUMn_YUi41U9i7IcqKIXd_k3ZyQ74sZcBs8CzAXEhpQeMJWLGjWjph8BKpx-19QhB-7tnWZNiplS6v65Cuyp9HpDtg=w1005-h397-no?authuser=0](assets/415-4.jpg)



## 2. Creative Consumption

Alright #2 and #1 were kept here for symmetry with [last year’s review](https://aarongilly.com/404/)’s Top 5. In this case, though these numbers are all in the table in the body of this Column. Maybe I’ll standardize this whole thing at some point. Or not I’m only human.



## 1. Creative Output

Same thing as number #2.

Still more to go, but the end is in sight.

# Motto: 10PM and all is well!

I'm publishing this update over lunch but it's been written since last night. The video rendered overnight and loaded to YouTube this morning. I'm going to post this and then watch the Colbert Report like my usual lunch.

This weekend was good. Here's an outline of what I did:

- Housewarming party
- Tailgating
- Royals game
- "Hole in the Wall"
- Mom & Dad's house
- Build a treehouse
- Basketball game

As everyone who reads this should already know, I'm making a video that shows one second from my life every day for a year. The project is going very well, honestly; but there is one thing that I've found frustrating time and time again. Some days you struggle to film a single interesting thing, and you end up with a boring shot. Other days you film several great shots, and you can't use them all. You end up with one good shot, and several other possibilities that don't make the cut. There are days that I am just sitting there, not doing anything. They are bad. I think "WHY can't I use some of the dozens of great videos I took from Thailand here! Why not some from the other weekend that I couldn't use!?"

But you can't do that.

When you are filming clips for the video, you never know which part of your day will be the most interesting, will work the best in the video, will be the one you use. So, you end up taking several videos. This Saturday and Sunday I took 17 shots. I am tired of wasting the unused ones, so I threw together a video using all 17 clips from this weekend. It's 4 1/2 minutes long:

[Editor's note: This video lost to time]

Today marks the end of the first three weeks using my Life Tracker. I have to say, it's gone really well. I have used the data input Form 246 times in the past 21 days. Those of adept at math will note that's an average of nearly 12 entries per day. Like I said, it's gone really well. I plan to keep it up for the foreseeable future, but not forever. After the conclusion of my fifth week on the tracker I'll write about my findings.

Almost exactly a year ago I got **very** interested in the idea of building a workbench. This Column celebrates the ups and downs that eventually lead to my (mostly) complete project.

# Design

I knew from the outset that I wanted to design my own product. There are hundreds of plans you can buy or find for free online if you’re so inclined - but I didn't want *someone else’s* workbench. I wanted something fit _exactly_ to my specifications. I wanted to define and execute on my own requirements. In short, I wanted my workbenches to be **mine**.

## My Requirements

My self-imposed requirements were as follows:

1. Function as a work top
2. Function as tool storage
3. Be movable by one person
4. Fit in garage with both vehicles
5. House my table saw, miter saw, and dust collection 
6. Closeable with no tools showing _(except the table saw)_
7. Have integrated power management & cleaning
8. Look relatively nice
9. Able to be secured to a trailer or truck bed. 
10. Utilize as much already on-hand lumber as possible.

## Design Iterations

The first ~8 months of work on this project were done purely with pen & paper (or Apple Pencil and digital paper). I went through at least a dozen iterations on the design. Sometimes throwing out requirements in the name of better serving other ones.

Several iterations of each of the ideas below were sketched out at some point over the past year:

- A small, modest folding workbench
- A large 4x8 workbench built to fit under a single sheet of plywood
- A workbench with a pegboard upper part & a light
- A pair of 2x8 workbenches
- A pair of 2x4 workbenches
- A single 2.5x6 workbench
- A pair of 2.5x6 workbenches

## “Final” Design

What I ultimately went with was a pair of 2.5x6 workbenches, each one built around a ‘main’ saw (miter saw & table saw).

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLXERGZ8BevhXx9Git7kyjq6d6Rt9xxcs7FcFthsUPgNoz1FuPDk2NtLKfe2xjaQ3OMXGrpq-nb8_Y4n_kULmChc0xsrw5mxRZZnZ-LvbSrj2L3uVglTeRAmm8IlJbinIJCd2sNC1HRSEotGogdAsBoJpQ=w1789-h724-no?authuser=0](assets/421-1.jpg)

That size was picked because I had a 2.5ft x 8ft butcher block table that I wanted to re-use, but my garage wouldn’t allow for 16 feet of workbenches side-by-side without interfering with the door. Also having 2 workbenches instead of one very long one makes it much more configurable and maneuverable.

# As Built

I finally satisfied my >1 year-long itch to build a workspace that I could take with me whenever I move to my next house. They’re 3 1/2 feet tall, otherwise known as 6 inches taller than a ‘standard’ countertop. This is by design, as standard counters are made for standard (i.e. non-6’9” tall) individuals. They’re 30 square feet of work space. Collectively they have 5 drawers, 2 (soon to be 4) cabinets, and house two major saws and all the rest of my tools.

Introducing my two workbenches, nicknamed “*Slowly*” and “*Shirley*”.

## Slowly

*Slowly* was started in early March. Immediately I went off-script from the CAD design, and thus suffered a lot of setbacks that slowed my progress significantly. Hence the name.

It is built to both house and act as an outfeed table for my table saw. It houses my dust collection system *(shop vac, 5 gallon bucket, and dusttopper)* and has onboard power. You plug in the workbench as a unit *(using an extension cord plugged into the side of the workbench)* and in so doing you’ve provided power to the table saw, the shop vac, the power-based vacuum switch, and provided power to the outlet on the front of the unit.

It also has 3 equal-sized drawers that are wide enough and deep enough to hold pretty much all the tools I own (28” wide, 26” deep, 10” tall on the inside). These drawers use side-mounted full-extension soft-close drawer slides.

*Slowly* is **not** square, but instead a bit of a parallelogram in two dimensions. The whole thing started with a skeleton that was slightly askew when initial measurements were taken. These were made permanent when the flat side pieces were cut. This meant everything after that had to be cut-to-fit. This, again, lead to its nickname.

## Shirley

*Shirley* was started in mid-April. When building *Shirley*, I stayed 95% faithful to the CAD design and didn’t repeat some early mistakes I made with *Slowly*. This made *Shirley* come together correctly the first time, without surprises, and no rework. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWxtHwkbFX6ltx9Gk-tjNnUkObONVtuS6fqdK3iRb2zz2paW87Ar4M7TeYqr1uBwABS3tMVpWfdJCPzrgDOJVqBQn6RSrnKSMkvn8f41MdkVzq99nZ0_S3__aGbfZaPvm4r1xnvcBm1VUvkIaMJodLDsw=w2414-h1810-no?authuser=0](assets/421-4.jpg)

*Shirley* was built around my miter saw. When in place, the miter saw sits in the center of the table, flush with the surface. The miter saw can be removed to leave gap where it normally goes, or I can insert a piece there to give it a flat seamless[^1] top: 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLXrBFgfEgxt5uPba56mBaIJ8c8yHY2EG9MNj5rE8Vm2WrslE0SXzdr18L6WpGktvlkFMMIYTvUCgNzy2qEUroZntyL3qRpYLOWngvf8jOGX_DP39aeRrCMmE_girZcsOBaLEhbotOSA4iZQFDtI-YKjMw=w2414-h1810-no?authuser=0](assets/421-5.jpg)

*Shirley* has two, slightly smaller drawers (24” wide, 24” deep, 6” tall on the inside) and were mounted using under mount, full-extension soft-close drawer slides. They are also inset ~1 inch from the front face of the workbench to make room for clamps to be used on the front face of the bench. Underneath the drawers is currently one open void for bulk item storage. On the left face is clamp storage, on the right face is currently nothing.

## Left to Do

They are functional. They work well. However they are also *incomplete*. I will be (at some point) painting them. The cabinet doors are made of plywood and the drawer fronts are made from MDF. This gives them a very inconsistent look, which I don’t like. 

My original design decision was to make my entire workbench setup “closeable” to keep out spiders and not advertise tools passers-by. As such, the front will (probably) (at some point) (maybe) be adorned with cabinet doors - soft close, like everything else.

# What I Learned

Just as important (or more so) as the final product is the things I learned in the process of making them.

## About Crafting

### Model-Based Benefits

I used my iPad and an application called “Shapr3D” to do the CAD work. It saved my bacon.

**I will 100% be designing everything I build from now on using some form of 3D CAD program before putting saw to wood.** 

I made so many fundamental changes with how things went together along the way. I thought an idea would work, built basically the _whole_ workbench digitally, then found some piece that made the design unworkable. Without the model-based approach first, I would have literally built myself into a corner.

### Clearly visualizing the details in advance prevents rework.

If you have a vague notion of how the thing you're building will go together, you **will** build yourself into a situation you hadn't anticipated. Each new part will be some part of error correction for issues introduced by the part before it. Eventually you may find yourself with an M. C. Escher drawing instead of a workpiece.

If you **know** how things will fit together _exactly…_ then they probably will do just that. Otherwise you're going to have occasions where you spend an hour  undoing something that took you all day to do in the first place.

### Always measure, but not always with a measuring tape. 

Measuring a piece by putting it across the gap it will span and making a mark is easier, more accurate, and less prone to error. The more I worked on these, the less often I measured things with a measuring tape *and* the better things fit together.

### Bulk processing yields better precision.

Bulk cutting using a stop block in conjuction with your miter saw makes cutting a repeatable lenght easy, just like setting your fence on your table saw. Speaking of which, set your fence on your table saw.

Always triple check what you're doing before you do bulk cuts, though. Nothing sucks worse than ripping down all your boards to 12 inches wide when they were all supposed to be 14 inches.

### Drawers are hard.

Making drawers requires better precision than I typically used. Always do bulk, repeated cuts on the table saw to make all 4 sides of your drawer at once. They need to be square, or else they'll pinch and pull when you slide them in and out.

If possible, make the drawers _first_, then the cabinet that houses them. The cabinet is easier to adjust than the drawers are.

### Undermount drawer slides are dope.

Undermount drawer slides are intimidating at first, but they shouldn’t be. They are bigger and have more bits and pieces, sure, but they are actually *more* forgiving and wind up looking better and working better. They're more expensive, but they're worth it.

### Check square by measuring across both diagonals.

If you want to see if something you've made is a proper rectangle, measure an X across its diagonals. If both diagonals are the same length, congrats. 

### Clamps = good.

Nuff said.  

## About Life

### I’m Susceptible to the Planning Fallacy.

The [planning fallacy](https://www.notion.so/Planning-Fallacy-086684a7163c45109ac892c350002fb1) essentially states that planners are overly optimistic and fail to account for things. I assumed at one point that I’d be able to knock out these benches over the course of a few long days once I started building.

I reckon I spent >100 hours building them. I was only off by an order of magnitude.

### DIY isn't always cheaper.

I didn’t track the costs of building these benches, but I’d estimate they were essentially on par with the cost of just building pre-built ones… if not a little more expensive. 

### Small progress, consistently.

I should be thanking James Clear, but instead I’ll thank my wife who reminded me of what I read about in Atomic Habits. 

I routinely got frustrated with my own lack of progress. The number of times I walked into the garage with the intention of "definitely finishing them *today*" only to walk back in the house ~6 hours later with very little to show for it... was demeaning. I was trying to sprint a marathon.

You know what works better? High-intensity interval training. Pomodoros. Chunking. All of these concepts and metaphors work better than building until you're sick of building, but you can't be done yet because you're not *done* yet. 

By the end of the project I was simply taking an hour so each night to knock it out in bits and pieces. Little progress, consistently. 



# Top 5: Things I'd Do Different if I were Starting from Scratch



## 5. Subvert my inner [Leeroy Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4)

Not sticking to the plan caused a lot of rework and hard lessons.



## 4. Wait to enclose the shell

The first thing I did with _Slowly_ was build the top, bottom, and all the sides. That meant I constantly having to sit on the floor or scrunch up in a little ball to fit inside the thing to do things like mount drawer slides.



## 3. Buy better lumber

I used studs I had left over from a previous application. They were not *nearly* as nice as the project boards I bought at the end.



## 2. Paint the faces before installing them

Now that the benches are together & functional, I do **not** want to take them apart for "finishing touches"



## 1. Plan for the long haul

I had no idea how many hours it would take me to build these. I went in with very wrong expectations and I set up Melissa with those same wrong expectations. She's a champ and trooper and has stuff of her own, thankfully, but we would have both been better off if I had a better appreciation for the magnitude of work.

# Motto: Sub Sandwiches are so named because they are the same basic shape as a submarine.

The motto was something completely obvious that I didn’t realize until just earlier today. That blew my mind with its obviousness.  

It has been brought to my attention that I don’t speak much of world events or general news outside of my realm of immediate interests. So, I’m going to try a brief Fourier (editor's note from 2020: Foray. This is a well-educated idiot's typo) into the broader news: 

Obama won the election. Alright, now that that’s over I can go back to talking about what I had planned.  

I hate forum snobs. I don’t like the word “hate” and try to use it as little as possible, so as to maintain its strong meaning, but it’s warranted in this situation. When I Google a problem I’m having, and I find a post where someone has the same problem as me on some obscure forum, there is a 50% chance my search will end with a forum snob than a real answer. Let me define Forum Snob to give you a better idea what I mean: 
**Forum Snob** – *Noun* – Person who cares more about the rules and bylaws of a forum than the content of said forum or any discussion therein. Characterized by a refusal to answer questions because “This question has already been asked before”, often accompanied by a snarky remark along the lines of “The ‘search button’ is right up there, use it”, “this isn’t the proper forum for this question”, or a more generic “you broke rule number (whatever)”. Just answer the question or let someone else do it. Shut up. You and your forum rules can go straight to hell.  

In other news, I realized recently I have invested about as heavily into Google as any one person can invest. I use:  
* Gmail 
* Google Calendar 
* Google Drive 
* Google Music 
* Google Search 
* Google Maps 
* Google Reader 
* Google+ 
* Google Talk 
* Google Hangouts (in my eyes, Hangouts are their own thing, separate from Google+) 
* Google Wallet 
* Google Tasks 
* Google Chrome 
* The most pure Google Android phone possible 
* The most pure Google Android tablet available 
* (Google) Picasa Photo Manager 
* Google Currents 
* I’m writing in a (Google) Blogger Blog  
* I have my own (Google) YouTube page. 
* I own several products from the Google Store  
* Soon, I will get my internet (and maybe television) straight from Google with the installation of Google Fiber directly into my place. 

The only POSSIBLE way I could be more invested into Google: 
* Using a ChromeOS computer instead of a Windows one (which honestly could change soon enough, my computer is about 3 steps away from dead right now). 
* Using Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office (I use each of them now, I can’t give up Excel and my Macros. I am too deeply in love. It’s what’s holding me back from a ChromeOS device. 
* Getting Google TV (which I’ve honestly looked into on multiple occasions) 

You could say I’m a Googler. Alternatively, you could say I drank the Google Kool-Aid. I consider myself a purist.  I’m going to end this post with a pair of Top 5’s that have nothing to do with anything I’ve talked about above.

# Top 5: Ways in which I am manly, in a traditional sense 
5. I have shot many guns in my day. I am interested in shooting more in the future. 
4. I like mathematics and the sciences 
3. I like building things, be they physical or computerized. 
2. I like steak, action movies, and Family Guy. 
1. I am technologically minded, I know how to hook up a home entertainment system and how to manage all of my technological equipment.   

# Bonus 2nd Top 5: Ways in which I am unmanly, in a traditional sense 
5. I sometimes sit cross-legged when nobody is around.
4. I don’t like breaking the rules. It makes me uncomfortable. 
3. I don’t care about cars, trucks, motorcycles, or any other mode of transportation, per say. 
2. I hate being dirty. I hate having a dirty place. 
1. I couldn’t care less about professional sports. The only sport I have the faintest glimmer of stake in is Men’s college basketball

# Future Technology Toolset

This is the trajectory I see myself walking as needs come up. I'm not going to abandon what I have that's working great right now in lieu of this imagined "better" future, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't obsess over this for 3+ hours yesterday. Ultimately, I convinced myself by remembering I am having the [[467#The Year of "Let it Be"|Year of Letting It Be]].[^1]

## Tech

This is the 4th or 5th iteration of me writing about consumer technology choices and the different possible combinations thereof. It's the first time since [[199|Column 199]] that I address the "what combination of form factors makes sense". Not a ton has changed, actually. 

### My Setup: Theory

![[469-1.png]]

The theory I had was that a desktop with a big monitor was just a better experience than a laptop, and that the big iPad was just a better experience than a small iPad. That my use cases for needing the power of a computer on the go were minimal enough that I could either use the iPad directly to satisfy them - its screen is as big as a laptop anyway - or in a pinch I could use my iPad to remote into my desktop... and that's what I do.

But, then there's this:

![[469-4.png]]

### My Setup: Reality

![[469-2.png]]

In reality, these theoretical benefits have not panned out. I was wrong about how frequently I'd want to be doing computer-like things *away* from my desk. Even right now I'm at my desk because I like this keyboard & proper multi-window workflows, but I'd rather be in the living room with the family, writing near them.

### Future Setup: Theory

![[469-3.png]]

If I'd gone less expensive on the iPad, I could have repurposed that money to change from the Mac Mini to a Macbook Air. This would give me better multitasking & typing on the go. A 2nd display for when I'm at the desk... *and* an easier to use and more portable iPad.

# Context

I roughly follow Tiago Forte's "[PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)" of personal organization. I was thinking about how **excellently-matched** my hobby of Puzzle Box making is for my life "areas". It got me wanting to make the graphic about which this Column is centered.

# Motto: This is a vacation
That's what I'm calling it at least. A vacation after school before getting my first big boy job. I'm not sure what that job will be (some sort of Electrical Engineering) or where it will be (probably Kansas), but I'm sure it will be satisfying. I've been in Lawrence for a few days now. I've been to the library, I've been around town looking at some of the things I was too busy to see in college. I like it here. I've been genuinely happy. It's been a nice vacation. 

Having said all that. I'm finally "settled", and that means it's time to be a little more proactive. I ran ~a mile and a half yesterday and I was sucking wind. I didn't anticipate doing well, and I definitely put on just as poor of a performance as I was expecting. Next week I'm going to the rec center every day.

I went to Kansas City to see my former lab partners. We played Settlers of Catan. I lost. We played Set (it's a card game that the three of us learned in our respective "gifted" courses). I lost. I did however figure out how many cards could be put down before a Set was guaranteed. That was good.

Well, I wanted to keep going, but I should probably do some work. I will leave this post with a picture I found of a dude who looks more like me (minus the ridiculous hair) than anyone else I've ever seen. Cover up his mullet, imagine the mustache away and tell me who that looks just like.

An increasingly specific Column.
# Bullet Journals
A bullet journal is a planner, journal, calendar, habit tracker, art book, and more all rolled up into a physical notebook. It's not a product, it's a *practice*. One that became more widely recognized around the start of the pandemic. I will overview them below, but encourage you to read [More about bullet journals]([https://bulletjournal.com](https://bulletjournal.com/)).
## Super Short Version
A bullet journal is a literal *journal*. A notebook you carry around with you and write in/reference throughout the day. The notebook can be *any* notebook, although [A5-sized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) notebooks are most common. The notebook is not itself structured[^1], but it *becomes* structured as you use it. You create in your notebook one page at a time, using whatever the next available page is. What makes this a "system" is the use of the modules documented in the Top 5.
# Philosophy: Digital vs Physical
Ever since the invention of the personal computer[^2] there has been a choice to make when it comes to how you organize your information - digital or physical? 

What used to be a "little black book", 12 month calendar, letterbox, post-it notes, notebook, and scrapbooks/photo albums is now just this:

![[460-0.jpeg]]

Since digital became an option, it's slowly evolved to become the *default* option. The Bullet Journal philosophy questions whether this is necessarily a good thing. It's not simply a luddite disdain for "new", longing for a return to some imagined "glory days of the past"... it's an argument about what genuinely works *better* - and is better for you. 
## Physical
### Clarity
Bullet Journals benefit from [Desired Difficulty](https://gillespedia.com/Desired+Difficulty). Space on a page is limited. Physically writing things takes time. This forces you to **slow down** and consider what matters to you. You must [Distill](https://gillespedia.com/Distillation) the [vital few](https://gillespedia.com/Pareto+Principle) into your system, disregarding the trivial many. This approach eschews "getting it all done" and embraces "getting done that which *matters*". It's one of my core philosophies that this the better way to live.
### Freeform
Pen on paper is also a very liberating way to externalize the mind. You aren't stuck working in the serialized world of typed text. Row ten, column six. My notebooks are filled with stars, doodles, circles and all forms of arrows & flowcharts. Text all askew. Some level of messiness is a feature, not a bug.
### Durability
There are books in the world today that are *thousands* of years old. Meanwhile, Microsoft Word document I wrote less than a decade ago look all weird now when you open them in Word today... and anything I wrote in erstwhile apps like "[springpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springpad)", is now just fully *gone*. Anything captured to paper will remain in that state forever - there's no concern of file formats becoming outdated. They aren't threatened by "the cloud" going down or hard drives dying. 
## Digital
All that said, there are also good, compelling reasons to prefer digital. 
### Search & Filter
There's no way to gather *statistics* about a bullet journal without reading it and creating them yourselves. The ability to `ctrl` + `f` is so ubiquitous now it's easy to forget that you used to have to scour books, consult indexes and tables of contents looking for (whatever). If you're consulting a series of bullet journals, trying to remember the time where you wrote down the thing about your car... ho boy.
### Pivoting
This gets into pretty data-specific territories - but in physical forms you have to commit to presentation of data **up front**. There's no easy way to "pivot" from bucketing things by week, versus bucketing things by *type*. The ability to separate **view** from an underlying **data model** is a super power of digital.
### Backup
This is sort of the antithesis of the "durability" angle - but if a physical notebook containing all your notes is in the same bag as your shampoo that explodes... you've got a problem. The ability to create backups of your journal frees you from fear of a careless placed glass of water ruining the central feature of your organized life.
## Best of Both Worlds
I believe both physical and digital mediums have a place in our lives. Your preferences obviously may shift your balance between "mostly digital" or "mostly physical", but the choice need not be binary[^3]. There are a few approaches you could take here, but I'll focus on two of them.
### The Medium Method
A term originally coined in [this article](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method) by Chad Hall, the Medium Method essentially boils down to using **both** digital tools and physical tools, with pre-planned hand-offs between the two. The specifics of the method aren't important (in my eyes, at least) but the idea is to use the approach (physical/digital) that suits the *situation*, then move the relevant bits to the other at a later time in accordance with your chosen plan. 

So you could:
Capture everything physically throughout the day, then transcribe to digital each night as part of a [Nightly Review](https://gillespedia.com/Daily+Review).

...or:
Use digital tools throughout the day, the distill that which deserves it and migrate to your physical notebook as part of a pre-bedtime ritual.
### Obsidian as a Digital Bullet Journal
Here's where this Column got **so hyper-specific** I decided to move this content to its own dedicated page. 

> [!tip] [[Making an Obsidian Bullet Journal]]

The TL;DR is what I'm trying right now. Basically a Medium Method where the physical part is pretty minimalist (on the order of a [daily post-it](https://gillespedia.com/Daily+Post+It) note) and the digital aspect utilizes [Obsidian](https://gillespedia.com/Obsidian) and [durable file types](https://gillespedia.com/Durable+File+Types).

What separates a *bullet* journal from, say, a journal you may have kept when you were younger is the systematic use of *modules*. These modules have different uses, but dovetail into one another to make the system coherent & cohesive. Included here are all the "main" modules extensively covered in the book, but other types are possible.

> [!note] 
> These are very utilitarian examples - most of the other examples you'll find online are much more pretty to look at. I'll include links to prettier examples.
### 5. Index
![[460-5.jpeg]]
The index is usually the first few pages. It's page numbers for [[#Collections]], [[#Monthly Logs]], and [[#Future Logs]]. Daily pages don't get indexed.

[More info & prettier examples of indexes.](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/index-mods-and-variations)

### 4. Future Logs
![[460-4.jpeg]]
A future log is typically a whole-year overview. A spread containing boxes for every month, in each month are big events and goals you have for the month. 

[Prettier examples of future logs.](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/future-log-inspiration)
### 3. Monthly Logs
![[460-3.jpeg]]
A monthly log is a list of the days of the month you're in and whatever important things need to happen on that day. Things like a party you're hosting, a doctor's appointment, important deadlines - or other such things that fall out of the standard daily/weekly routine. 

[Prettier examples of monthly logs.](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/monthly-logs)
### 2. Daily Logs/ Rapid Logging
![[460-2.jpeg]]
These take up the bulk of a "standard" Bullet Journal. They are a heading for a new day, and any little events, notes, observations, or tasks you pickup throughout the day. They are meant to be very economical in terms of letters written and info captured.

> [!fail] Standard note taking bullet
> - I sent an email to Samantha asking for next Friday off for the trip.
> - I should remember to pack the night before so I can wake up and go.

> [!success] Rapid log
> - emailed boss re: time off
> 	- ⭐️ Pack night before
### 1. Collections
![[460-1.jpeg]]
"Collections" are Ryder Carrol's catch-all term for "anything else", adhering to a theme. Common collections include:

- Trackers - habits, diet, workouts, books read, movies, etc
- Quotes you like
- Reference info about (whatever)
- Plans about an upcoming vacation
- Joke ideas

The idea is it that it's a spot designated for a type of thing that you might come back to or add to over time. Another name for "Collections" could have been "References and repositories".

# Motto: Purity is in the eye of the column writer

Last night I was looking through the column on my (old) Galaxy Nexus using the Google Currents app. Currents, if you don't know, is a news/RSS reader that pulls text articles and pictures in from various websites. They are aggregated them and formatted in an easy-to-digest manner for mobile. Currents can be wonky at times, especially if the sites from which it pulls are not put together neatly on the back-end. Today marks the first column I'm writing with my new, more pure, more simple Column Starting Template. You may notice subtle changes between this column and the one below it. Then again, you may not. Either way, I'll feel a lot better about it.

The next, and last, thing I'm going to write about is what came in the mail for me today while I was at work: My Nexus 4.

Let me set the scene for you.

I picked up my package from the front desk. Brought it to my room. Turned on only the lights that I needed to to see what I was doing. I turned on Ave Maria using Google Music. I slowly cleared a spot on my counter.

If I had candles, I would have lit them.

I opened the box. It was then my eyes saw the beauty. I just stared at it for probably several minutes. Only after soaking up all the goodness, did I pick it up. I spent the remainder of the song just turning the device over and over again in my hands again, appreciating the aesthetics. The texture. The color. The weight. The glimmer. The size. The details. After the song ended, I turned it on.

The entire rest of this column (down to the quote) is effectively a short comparative review of the Nexus 4.

![](assets/51-1.jpg)

I had to a make two of these... and I still barely got the whole word "eleven" on there.

I love it.

It's sleek. It feels great in the hand. The haptic feedback feels great when interacting with the device. The notification light is classier. The display's white reproduction destroys that of the Galaxy Nexus. The camera performance is all-the-way-around much better (see the Top 5). The upgrades of 4.2 are all there (thanks to Verizon, they weren't there on my GNex). I've only had the device for a few short hours, and I'm already in love.

I just escalated it from "I love you" to "I'm in love with you" status. That is a big jump.

Rendering a regular old panorama takes the Galaxy Nexus ~10 seconds. The Nexus 4 got it down in ~2. This was the first real dose of added speed that I could put my finger on... but not the last. The menus fly. Loading apps is instant. Everything is great.

The device feels so much more premium. No longer is the iPhone undeniably a better quality device by manufacturing standards... and that's nice.

I'm not one for conspiracies, but:
   Nexus 4
+ Nexus 7
+ Nexus 10
= Nexus **21**

Oh, wait, the movie **23** is about global conspiracies and mental insanity... the movie **21** is about the guy from Across the Universe being really good at blackjack. Nevermind. I'd delete all this, but it's already been written and I'm too lazy.

Oh, and I got all my Christmas shopping done this weekend. I'm so ahead of the game. There was a full 2 weeks left.

Although Christmas will never come because [The End of Ze World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZMwKPmsbWE) is coming December 21st. Stupid Mayans. That video in that link has foul language, by the way. It's also really really dumb and not worth anyone's time. Nevertheless, it's internet famous.

I can't write anymore. I want to go play with my new toy.

Yup.

A lot of output from me lately. I’m sure I'll slow down soon - I've just had a lot of things I want to write about lately.

# Growth Requires Discomfort

I think there’s a direct relationship between how much success you find in life and how often you willingly make yourself uncomfortable.

![Untitled 1.svg](/assets/images/431-zone.jpeg)

I say this as a guy who’s self-identified chronically addicted to comfort. It’s an unfortunate fact of life: if you’re comfortable all the time, you’ll slowly become *uncomfortable* all the time. 

Here are some ways in which I’m gotten out of my comfort zone lately.

## I’m Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-rebuilding My Thing

I’ve written extensively about my Personal Data Warehouse project, which has been around so long it’s had more names than I have limbs. I’ve tweaked the codebase substantially 11 times over the past 9.8 years[^1]. Each time I’ve learned a little bit. The 4 times I tore it all down and started from scratch corresponded with 4 dramatic leaps in learning - see the Top 5. Now, you could argue that doing a thing you’ve done 11 times before isn’t “stepping out of your comfort zone”, but it’s working with a new language, new framework, and an entirely different paradigm. That’s hard.

## I’m (Finally) Keeping some Streaks

I’ve not probably given the Streaks App on iOS enough credit here. It was almost single-handedly responsible for me sort of learning to play guitar, getting in the best shape of my life, and teaching myself web development. It’s not a complicated app. The only thing it does is help you keep track of whatever habits you want. 

Life is hectic. Life with a 2 year old and 4 year old is especially hectic. There is no such thing as “a strict routine you can rely on”. If you rely on strict habits to get you in the gym often enough, your gym habit is fragile. Having a habit tracker makes for a more flexible, more *durable* habit. Doesn't matter when you do the thing, so long as you make some time to do it at all. Now, that doesn't make it *easy*, it just makes it possible. 

## FigJam

As promised in [Column 430](/430), I am going to write about FigJam. It was an uncomfortable experience switching my main "puzzle planning" app. When I posted that Column I thought I was going to write in THIS post about how I was too uncomfortable making the switch and decided to stick with GoodNotes 5. What actually happened was I stuck through the discomfort and really came to convince myself "no, this actually genuinely **is** better now that I've pushed through the transition jitters. Growth requires discomfort. How about that.

# Artificial Intelligence

I’m late to the game on writing about artificial intelligence. Everyone is fascinated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E 2… and I’ll be honest for whatever reason it didn’t *really* interest me until it became so trivially easy to interact with. I realized [this app on the app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/draw-things-ai-generation/id6444050820) can generate images based on text prompts from on my iPad - as many images as I want - at zero cost to me. My Notion account was recently granted access to their limited-release newly-introduced “AI Block” feature. Now I can generate images and text with essentially zero effort. AI has been around for years and years, but this is easily the coolest thing I’ve ever seen it do… and I haven’t even made an OpenAI account yet to play with the newsworthy ones. Although I **have** seen second hand some of the results that are possible from throwing more high-powered resources into the image generations AIs, and they put the previously linked app to absolute shame.

So, everything *not italicized* from here down to the Top 5 will be produced by AI, based on what I want to see.

## Freddy the Frog and the Turtles

Freddy the Frog was a happy-go-lucky amphibian who loved to hop around in his pond, enjoying the warm summer days and chasing dragonflies. But he had one problem: he didn't like turtles. Whenever he saw one of them slowly making its way across the pond, he would hop right up to it and croak out a rude comment.

One day, however, Freddy found himself in a sticky situation. He was hopping around, minding his own business, when he came across a huge pond turtle. The turtle was so big that Freddy couldn't hop over it, and he was afraid to hop around it. He was stuck.

That's when the turtle spoke. "What's the matter, little frog?" it said in a deep, rumbling voice. "Why don't you just hop around me?"

Freddy was taken aback. He had never heard a turtle speak before, let alone speak to him. He was so surprised that he couldn't find the words to answer.

The turtle smiled and said, "I understand. It can be a bit intimidating when you're smaller than someone else. But you know what? Turtles aren't so bad. We can be nice, too."

Freddy took a deep breath and slowly hopped around the turtle. He was surprised by how kind the turtle had been, and he decided to take the turtle's advice. He realized that growth required stepping out of his comfort zone, and from then on, he didn't let the turtles scare him away. Instead, he took the time to get to know them and even became good friends with some of them.

*Editors note: I told it to write about “a frog that learns to be nice to turtles”. It chose to include the bit about getting out of your comfort zone - I have no idea if that was a **massive coincidence** or not.*

![D86B6367-B177-40AB-A470-2BA08516F81E.png](/assets/images/431-frog.png)

*Editors note: I told it to generate “a cartoon of a small frog talking to a large turtle’. It gave up on the turtle, I guess.*

# Motto: My own personal Jarvis

I read a fascinating article this morning making predictions about Google's upcoming developer conference: Google I/O. At this conference each year Google talks to its partners about what they can expect to see coming from Google for the coming year. Naturally, its an event I always pay close attention to. I would imagine 30 days from now, when I/O is officially over, I will be walking around lost in a sea of the eventual possibilities floating around in my head. Honestly, that is where I already am. You'll see soon enough.

I scheduled a flight to see my girlfriend in Indiana in a month. She is the head hancho of music at a camp for populations of various disabilities. This is right up her alleyway and she's awesome at what she does. They are lucky to have her... as am I.

It will be the first time I've flown by myself.

I'll be living in Lawrence pretty soon. I think it will be good for me.

Well, the Top 5 is going to be huge, so I'll end this with a picture of my EDC (thus completing my recent fascination with it/writing about it).

![EDC](assets/9-1.jpg)

# Top 5: Predictions for the direction of Google
5. Google+ will continue to the top dog in terms of Google's focus. The underlying social connection between all of Google's products will continue to expand, bring in more real users, and integrate further with Android and the rest of Google existing and soon-to-exist lineup of services.
4. Google Assistant will be announced formally at Google I/O, will be come out on select Android devices before the end of the year. It will be a direct competitor with Apple's "Siri" and will likely surpass Siri (at least in her current state) on all fronts. The assistant will have better voice recognition, better text-to-speech (almost human-grade TTS), will natively be capable of more than Siri is currently, and will have a developer API allowing it to be integrated with any/all functions developers can choose. Google Assistant will be huge.
3. There will be (in all of technology, I think) a grand unification of devices. Things that used to be separate entities will merge into the different functions of something better. This has already happened some... for example- phones, GPS units, PDAs, still cameras, video cameras, and MP3 players used to be four separate devices. Now I carry around all four of those things in one pocket. Google (and other firms) are already working on including (and, arguably have already included) Television, Computers, Home Audio, Video Game Consoles, and other such devises. Soon, I imagine all your media needs will be controllable from a single device. 
2. Google Glass - the smart eyewear will continue to be developed. It will probably (probably) not catch on from a mass-consumer standpoint, but will be seen in more specialized situations. Doctors, policemen, and many other people could benefit from the technology as I see it. If they are made available to the public, I would consider them.
1. Life in the cloud... We are amidst a great paradigm shift. Google Drive, Google Play, and every other competitor (Apple has one, DropBox, the soon-to-be-rebranded Windows Live, and many others) have ushered in a new technological era. Gadgets used to be a local storage spot for all your pictures, music, documents, and videos. If you wanted to listen to a song on your computer, you had better have synced it with your iPod recently or you were S.O.L. Now, every song I own I have stored in Google's Music Cloud. I can listen to any track in my collection without wasting precious local storage space. Essentially, the 58MB Google Music app on my phone gives me access to my >12GB of music. Every photo I have is with me at all times via Picasa and the Google+ photos feature. I read Fight Club via Google Play on my phone, tablet, and on the web. When I had time I'd read a few chapters on my phone. Later that night, when I opened up my tablet to read a few more, it would put me just where I had left off with my phone.

# Motto: Knowledge is Power!

Today's post is an article on acumen and aptitude. A blurb on brains and brilliance. A commentary on capacity and comprehension. A discourse on discernment and deciphering. An item on intelligence and intellect. A piece on perception and precocity. A story on smarts and savvy. A write-up on wit and wisdom.  I am approaching the subject of intelligence not only because it's an important general life topic but also because I want to challenge myself to write with humility - for I am a humble man.   Before I write about intelligence, I think I must share this with you as a disclaimer: I am smart.  And it turns out I'm not actually humble.  Based off a lifetime of experience and achievement, based off mountains of observation and self-reflections, based off third-party testimonials and reviews, based off accomplishments and awards, I feel as though I can safely say that I meet the minimum intelligence threshold to be considered "smart" by the majority of the population.

As anyone would tell you, though, there are different kinds of "smart". This is usually broken down into "Book Smart" and "Street Smart". While I agree these make for great high-level categories of intelligence, I think any real in-depth analysis of the subject cannot stop there. Here is my list of sub-categories & justifications:

## Book Smarts
"Book Smarts" - made up of these
Analytical - takes situations or subjects and picks them apart, able to see how variables affect one another. The kind of people who make good engineers.  
Logical - can think and act objectively, good at following logical chains of events. The kind of people who make good programmers.  
Theoretical - chases down grand overarching themes in different types of situations. The kind of people who get so lost in their own thoughts they could ride the wrong bus for an hour before realizing their mistake.  
Educated - a walking dictionary/encyclopedia. The kind of people who win Jeopardy.   
Linguistic - people who show a strong command of language. The kind of people who write super entertaining Columns.

## Street Smarts
"Street Smarts" - made up of these
Interpersonal - knowing how to talk to and relate with people. Able to effectively discern people's emotions and read body language. The kind of people you want to be friends with.  
intrapersonal - knowing yourself. Knowing what you like and don't like. Knowing what ticks you off and what makes you tick. The kind of people who talk way too much.  
Aware - knowing where you are and what you are doing at any given moment. This is surprisingly difficult for some theoretical people.  
Life Smart - this one is hard to put into words. Basically just knowing your goals in life and your responsibilities. Seeing problems in your life and fixing them. People who are life smart have some sense of direction and don't let things take them off that path. Life Smart people aren't addicted to anything. They manage their time and resources better than average.  
Things that don't really fit into either category, but need to be mentioned:
Creative - people who can think outside the box.  
Artistic - people who can think outside the box and make it pretty.  
Topical - people who know everything about something. Tradespeople.  
Capable - probably the most important of all, people who actually can do the things they need/want to do. Nothing else matters if you are not capable.  
I just pulled that list together on the fly. It could use some refinement, but I'm running out of time.  

Performing a self analysis I would say my strengths are intrapersonal, analytical, logical, and "life smart". My weaknesses are awareness, artistry, and probably capability. I am capable of the things I'm capable of. But I don't waste time or energy on things that I don't really care about, which makes me incapable of some relatively important things.

"My car is acting funny."

"What's wrong with it?"

"I dunno."

I'm going to meet my parents in Ottawa very soon, but I want to finish this before i go. I'm just going to leave it with this - 

Being smart is a blessing. My university psychology professor said something to the effect of "You guys and girls are lucky! You're going to have a better life than people who didn't make it university. You are statistically more likely to live longer and happier lives." I agree.

Here's the first relevant picture I can find:

Homer Simpson

Top 5: Drawbacks of Being Smart
5. Sometimes you miss out on the simple pleasures of life. Looking at the stars. Smelling the roses. Laughing at a fart. You know, the good stuff.
4. You can alienate people if you aren't (inter)personable. 3. It can be hard to empathize with someone who continually makes bad decisions. It becomes too easy to blame someone's problems squarely on them. If you fail to see the logic in their decisions or if you think "If I were in their shoes I would have just done ____; and they didn't do that, so it's their fault."
2. You can get away without trying very hard in K-12 (and in college, if you undershoot your potential). Eventually you have to learn how to try hard. 1. You understand just how truly messed up some things are. There are so many injustices and inefficiencies everywhere; and there is very little any one person can do about it.

...A.... MOVIE!

# AND WE'RE BACK

![image](assets/405-1.jpg)

After a 15 month hiatus with no new mainline MCU[^1] content, last Friday I got to hear the Marvel Cinematic Universe theme play once again. I wasn't emotionally prepared to walk back into some sense of excited normalcy after having been living the pandemic life for a year. I was on my couch, nonchalantly pressed play, and literally froze when I heard the theme. I was very close to getting chills, just in anticipation of what would come next.

Transfixed, I watched for the next hour or so, through the first two episodes of "WandaVision". I've been really enjoying the show, and disappointed with the reaction to it I've seen from some of my friends & acquaintances. It's weird. It's not what you were expecting. Maybe it's not what you were hoping for; but it's different. It is what it is and I like that it's genuinely treading new ground in the MCU. I can't wait to see how it plays out.

# Morning Routine

For the past 7 3/4th years, I have had a nightly journaling/quantified self routine. I write a few sentences about my day into a journal, form, or some other data-input mechanism I've constructed, and it is appended to a running log of journal entries (among other data). 

Surprisingly, despite being able to consistently complete a nightly ritual for 400+ weeks, I have never had an equivalent morning-time ritual lasting more than a month or two. I've had various ones come and go. I would get up and work out. I would get up and knock out some coding class lessons. I would get up and write. But... nothing stuck. Nothing had staying power.

I hereby commit to a new morning routine: following the [2-Minute Rule of habit change](https://www.notion.so/2-Minute-Rule-of-Habits-75ab089c53af4feeb347c7bdad1ca423), using the support of [habit-tracking](https://www.notion.so/Habit-Tracking-92b5a17d877949b4a0eb0dfd3290afbb), I will begin each morning by looking at my "Page of the Week" page in Notion, where I will review any previous notes/plans and establish one intention for the day. Perhaps which [frog I will eat](https://www.notion.so/Do-What-s-Hardest-First-b8ef4a109ced4a31bb7b2a062729f9df), or a mantra for the day, or simply a reminder to be the best husband/father/friend I can be.

# Data Journal 10

I've sort of began in earnest working on a 10th iteration of my Google Sheets-based Life Tracking System. Why? Well, partially, at this point it just feels like catching up with an old friend. I have learned so much about what I want, what's technically possible, and what works best over the past 9 iterations. Another large part of the motivation for making it is that I want to see how easy I can make the whole process for other folks to pick up. I want to make the thing *shareable*. See the Top 5 for some more specifics about how it will work[^2]

# Closed Rhyming Pairs & A Poem

I recently stumbled across the concept of a [closed rhyming pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_closed_pairs_of_English_rhyming_words?wprov=sfti1) - a pair of words in the English language that *only* rhyme with each other. Looking through the list, I developed an itch to write something using **pairs of closed rhyming pairs**. This is what I wrote.

> **Scrutiny or Mutiny?**  
I'm just a lonely yachtsman, out here on the sea.  
My crew, only Scotsmen, talk Scottish about me.  
Alas, English and Spanish comprise my lexicon menu.  
I wouldn't have this problem if they were from a Mexican venue.  
Their affection I would cherish most chiefly.  
Without them I would perish quite briefly.  
It could be because I was previously a minister,  
but their talking about me sounds so deviously sinister.  
Is it that I got that doorway from Sydney?  
Or that I went to Norway for a kidney?  
Is it that I dated the sharpest violinist,  
and the harpist that was the thinnest?  
Is it that I use deodorant so cheaply and sparsely?  
Or perhaps how incredibly deeply I love parsley?  
Is it off-putting, the pigment of my clothing?  
Or am I only *imagining* this figment of loathing?  
To my first mate Finis, I handed a nice cold beverage.  
I thought with a Guinness, some good favor I could leverage.  
He said: "bear witness, as a captain you've done beautifully.  
Perfect fitness for the job, which you've performed dutifully.  
But if you do not want our situation to worsen, my president.  
Stop calling me a Scottish person - I'm an Irish resident.  

It's not perfect. But it's mine. 


# Top 5: Data Journal 10 Features


## 5. A Data Manifest

When you track things for long enough, you'll find that what you want to keep track of may ebb and flow. So, how do you handle tracking the things you're tracking? A data manifest - that's how. The new Data Journal iteration is going to be fully-centered around the concept of the Data Manifest. The manifest will describe each measure, what it contains, where the data are located, and other information about its granularity, default values, et cetera.


## 4. Write REST API

One thing I've built that I now value highly is the ability to receive and track data sent via web requests. This opens up a lot of automation possibilities. Things like IFTTT or Siri Shortcuts or Tasker (on Android) are quite capable of sending arbitrary datasets to web URLs according to a wide variety of triggering events. 


## 3. Read REST API

This one is not quite as important as the ability to write to the web, but spreadsheets aren't always the best user experience. I've already made a few iterations of user interfaces that I can port over with essentially no retooling to be hosted via a Google Apps Script Webapp. I want to make the two means of interaction with the data equally viable.

I present, exhibits A, B, & C:


A: a [Vis.JS](https://visjs.org/) timeline

B: a sort of card-based UI, using no frameworks or libraries at all
![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cHfObmFawvEQH87-44ecyTIBVIoj1OphfA9a0Csv0k9mfp-2XX7fyDPc7ub3OXZwPgKlwXdllAcbHK4VuAOmJ3ugMQKqLjmHnaHkjKb-1ujYM2hRrH7RmiVky7TRLFTt0oZbJXzGTgirkuGHlfmsi7TQ=w800](assets/405-3.png)

## 2. Support for Granularity Levels from One Second to One Year

One of the biggest reasons for my departure from the long-running "Life Tracker Version 7" was the inability to track data that are relevant several times a day. This limitation made things like tracking medicines impractical and needlessly interjected weird proxy factors into my quantified self data. Example: I could only say I watched *at least some* TV 60 days out of 2019... but I couldn't tell you how many shows I watched per day. Doing things like counting unique shows becomes more cumbersome when "Modern Family", "Community", "Modern Family, Community", and "Community, Modern Family" are counted as 4 unique strings, rather than 2 unique shows.

However my plunge into "everything down to the lowest level of granularity" is also not *really* ideal, either.


## 1. Sharability

I really want to make something that others can use and learn from. They can learn about themselves, and they can learn about coding and spreadsheets and whatnot. It turns out being good at that stuff can take you to some pretty neat places.

# Motto: For your treatment I prescribe several highly concentrated doses of life.

I did an experiment concerning confirmation bias. As it turns out, everything I expected was true.  \#jokesthatsuck.  That joke about confirmation bias comes to you from when I was driving earlier. There was an overly aggressive vehicle weaving in and out of traffic, doing his best to go as fast as humanly possible. when he passed me, he had a bumper sticker for a musical artist from a genre I despise (who it was isn't relevant). I thought to myself "that person WOULD drive like a jerk, he listens to that crap." Then I thought, if that person hadn't had that bumper sticker, would I have noticed how jerkishly he was driving? Then, in the middle of traffic, I realized confirmation bias was back-seat driving me towards false conclusions.  On a possibly related note: If you listen to Tech N9ne, there's a good chance you suck at driving like a normal person.  Since my last update, I have been BUSY. Like a YES man, I have done a lot of living. Here's some summaries:  Friday, Saturday, & Sunday:This past weekend I got to spend with three of the best dudes in the world. We battled, we laughed, we ate like kings. It was one of my favorite weekends I've ever lived.  More specifically, we played paintball. We rented out some gear and time a place in Wichita. We played a variety of paintball-based games for 3 hours. We were a team of undefeatable Navy SEAL-like warriors. At least, that's what I pretended we were was like; in actuality, we split up and ran around like idiots. We giggled with delight like little kids when we ran through dangerous paths of fire. We very clumsily made our way though each game, suffering heavy casualties. There was a lot of blindfire around cover. There was a lot of tripping and stumbles from cover to cover. It was only after my back started hurting from hunching over that I started Ramboing it up. My only legitimate kills happened when I was walking slowly, out in the open, shooting with one hand on an outstretched arm.   Afterwards we bought steaks and grilled them.  There were also several trips to various gun stores sprinkled around in there. My friends like guns. I like feel dumb when I'm around them in gun stores. They start speaking in code.   Monday:Monday was spent in Topeka and Lawrence. Lunch with my sister. Dinner with Melissa's sister. Ice cream with my ex-residents. I enjoyed hanging out with my sister, as always. Getting to know Melissa's sister outside of the usual context was awesome. I thought it was going to be fun and comfortable. I underestimated just how fun it was going to be. I enjoyed it. Lastly, I spent an hour with my old residents from Templin. We ate ice cream and got talked to an uncomfortably large amount by a waiter that creeped the five of us out.   Tuesday:Tuesday night I attended a comedic event presented by Nick Offerman, the guy who plays Ron Swanson on the television show "Parks and Recreation". His character is the breakout star - and arguably the main reason the show is so popular. In the 2 hour comedic lecture, Mr. Offerman offered up a great deal of philosophy and hilarity. The driving theme of this event was a set of ten tips on how to live a productive and successful life. They varied from serious to silly, but were all very enjoyable. One example of the topics he covered: cellphones and mirrors are both useful tools, but are both widely abused and can cause us to miss out on the life we have. A relevant side note here - before the show I counted up the number of people in my section and I counted up the number of them that were looking at their cell phone rather than talking to their neighbors or taking in the beauty and grandeur of the Midland theater. There were 65 people in my section. There were 29 people looking at their phones. I made a note of it on my phone.   While watching the event, I came to the conclusion that "Ron Swanson" is actually the same person as "Nick Offerman". It was exactly as if Ron Swanson was standing on stage talking to a crowd - which was a good thing. The show was very enjoyable. Nick Offerman's vocabulary and manner of speech are very unique and entertaining. I aspire to both speak and write with more voice. Eloquence be thy name, yo.  Wednesday:Wednesday after work, two friends and I made a trek to watch KU play OSU in Stillwater, OK. The drive down was four and a half hours of junk food, blaring music, and anticipation. We went to the arena an hour before the game was to start. The arena itself had more seating than the Fieldhouse at KU, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. It never approached the noise levels KU's home games reach. Their videoboard was inferior in quality to ours and the video they showed on it lacked the historical significance or big moments that our pre-game video has. I'm not trying to say their video was bad, I'm just saying that I have been spoiled by KU. There were several OSU traditions I did like, though. Some of their chants were pretty cool. Mostly what I was impressed by was the fans we sat around. They were respectful. More than respectful, they were friendly. They cheered when they did will. We cheered when we did well. We chatted during down times. I think there was an unspoken kinship there. It helps that the three of us in blue were three of the nicest, least confrontational people you'll ever meet (I just included myself on that).

As for the game itself, it was a dead-heat. After halftime, the game was tied. After regulation time, the game was tied. After overtime #1, the game was tied. After overtime #2, KU had scored 1 more point than OSU. Neither team lead by more than 5 at any point in the game. It was the most evenly matched college game I've ever seen, I think.

The drive home was 5+ hours of singing, cheering, and answering brilliant hypothetical questions. We were outrunning this massive snowstorm the whole way home. When we hit Wichita, it was devastating Stillwater. By the time we hit Emporia, it was decimating Wichita. And when got home, it was destroying Emporia. We managed to get home safely and in good spirits, mostly because we are the three best friends that anybody can have. The drive home really solidified the whole trip as a great bonding experience.   One note on money - I have spent a ton. Gas to Wichita + Paintball: $60 Tickets to Nick Offerman: $40 1/3rd of gas to Stillwater + KU tickets: $120 Various food expenses while away from my kitchen: ~$80  I definitely can't keep living at that pace. I have decided to forgo buying a TV in order to save money for a trip to Thailand. 

Here are several pictures from the events detailed in this column:

And it hasn't gotten any better.

# Top 5: Moments Since the Last Update
5. After the last round of paintball was over, I shot an unsuspecting Josh in the butt
4. On the way out of Gallagher-Iba Arena an OSU fan asked me if I was Jeff Withey's brother - thus confirming what everyone always says about me and him looking alike.
3. Nick Offerman sings one last song to say goodbye - "5000 Candles in the Wind" by Mouse Rat (a band also from Parks and Rec).
2. Travis Releford stops the ball from rolling out of bounds with 3 seconds left in double overtime to seal up a 68-67 KU victory.
1. My first paintball kill - I accidentally shot the referee in the neck.

A varied column covering whatever! Sorry this is so long & that I waited so long to post it. I have a potential remedy for that situation coming. I'd like to do slightly shorter, more focused Columns slightly more frequently.

# Life

Life's been good. I've had a change at work that I'm optimistic about. The weather is good. We recently swam in the pool for the first time this year. My family been healthy lately. My medications seemingly have continued to keep my wonderful [autoimmune disease](406) at bay. For the first time in working memory I've made some new friends, which is hard to do once you hit parenthood. Also I caught a flattering reflection in my spoon. All's well!

## Shower

[11 months ago](436) I wrote about the completion of a long-running homeowner's project in which I fixed our water feature. That project took 13 months to complete. It felt like the end of a marathon. It was definitely **very** difficult, but it isn't the longest-running home improvement project I've ever done. 

![[454-1.png]]

That picture was from a little while ago. We are very quickly approaching the end of a shower renovation which has taken about 2 1/2 ***years***. When you're measuring your progress in terms of *years*, you know things aren't great. It's been a saga. I most definitely under appreciated how much work a down-to-the-studs shower remodel would take. We've spent 20+ hours over the past week just tiling. It's still not done, but getting close. 

Time to demo the rest of the master bath. Surely that part will be easy and fast. 😶

## 75 Hard

Melissa and I started a 75 Hard in June. 75 Hard is a challenge in which you adhere to the following rules **every day**:

1. Work out for 45 minutes x2 per day, one of them being outdoors
2. Follow a diet
3. Abstain from alcohol
4. Drink a gallon of water (plain water, ice optional)
5. Read 10 pages of a non-fiction book (with your eyes, not your ears)
6. Take a progress picture every day

The point of all of this is *partly* about physical fitness, but **mostly** about *mental fitness*. It's about discipline. One day is not so bad, but 75 days in a row is the challenge. It's a change in lifestyle. One that requires you to live outside your comfort zone daily. 

We're not being too dogmatic about it. We're probably doing a "75 Hard Asterisk". I'm not adhering to certain rules (I don't care to take a progress photo every day, for example)... but I'm adding on other rules in the spirit of the challenge. Namely rules regarding my relationship with my phone.

# Consumer Electronics Setup

I cover this topic pretty much every single year. It’s something I think about a lot. 

For the past ~[4 years](398) I’ve had a setup that looked like: **phone + iPad + desktop PC**[^1]

For the most part, I love this setup. It was chosen as the no-compromises setup. The iPad is the best at what iPads do. A desktop is the best at what desktops do. [A phone is just *required*](438).

One thing that’s been bothering me lately, though, is how *little* my fancy desktop computer gets used, simply because I have to be where it is. I have wound up using this iPad like a computer more than I would like an iPad. This isn’t the ideal way to use it. Also because the iPad is *big* (to make it more computer-like), it’s *also* slightly less easy to use for traditional iPad stuff because it's so big. It's hard to one-hand for things like reading books on.

What I’m saying here, in short, is that if everything were to suddenly go kaput, I’d probably switch to a iPhone + MacBook Air + Regular-sized iPad Air setup. The normal person approach.

# Impressiveness

Every time I think I’ve done something neat, I’m reminded that I’m a small fish swimming in a giant ocean of impressive people. I think some of the stuff I’ve done is cool, don’t get me wrong - but there's me then there's *actually* impressive people. See the **Top 5** for more impressive things, but here's a brief summary of where I'm at nowadays with my various long-running projects.

## This Blog

Works! You're reading it now! I've settled in on a writing process that allows me write pretty easily (although *publishing* is still a bit of a task). 

## My Notes

These have **really** taken off as my main "what I write and put on the internet" thing. Recently I moved over [Gillespedia.com](https://gillespedia.com) to the official Obsidian Publish service, just to give them some money and simply my publishing process. As a side-effect, I accidentally got access to telemetry on the site's performance/reach. Turns out people read it. Huh.

## My Puzzle Boxes

Last year's puzzle box was great. It was also the victim of massive scope creep & I wound up spending way more time than I meant to implementing all of the ideas I had during a frenzied period of ideas. This has left me with a puzzle box hangover that I'm only now starting to come out of. There will be a 2024 puzzle box, but right now it only exists on metaphorical paper.

## The PDW

My Personal Data Warehouse is still going fairly strong. It's collecting automated data and I'm feeding it stuff manually every day. It's the subject of a series of personal learning assignments I've made for myself to [practice enterprise architecture](https://gillespedia.com/Enterprise+Architecture+of+the+PDW).



# Top 5: One-Person Efforts that have Impressed Me Lately



## 5. [Tick Tock Escape Rooms](https://ticktockescaperoom.com)

I've only been here a couple of times, but on boht occasions I've been impressed - and come to find out the room design, construction, and coding are pretty much the work of one guy - who's even in the little scenario setup videos. Good stuff.



## 4. [The Practice of Enterprise Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/064508252X?dplnkId=77a3af08-7805-4aed-8eff-34e17412ca4a&nodl=1)

This book was researched & written by one dude. It’s consistently recommended as one of the best depictions of enterprise architecture no matter where you look (provided your source is recent enough). It’s also surprisingly down-to-earth with its recommendations, which is a change of pace compared to most other EA resources. 



## 3. [Floor 796](https://floor796.com/)

This webpage was coded and actively being constructed by one guy. It’s a massive looping animation depicting the happenings on the 796th floor of a massive space station. It’s jam-packed with pop culture references, jokes, and interesting stuff to find. It’s amazing. Try finding Waldo[^2]!



## 2. [Animal Well](https://www.animalwell.net)

This is a new puzzler/Metroidvania video game that was developed by one guy over the course of 7 years. It has set the internet ablaze in order to solve some of the genuinely amazing puzzles that I never had a chance of solving. The game is fun, moody, and massively creative. Moreover, the creator *also* wrote the game engine from scratch. I’m blown away by this piece of work.



## 1. Our Lawn

When we moved into this house we adopted a pretty well-managed lawn. While I broke my back fixing the water feature once, Melissa has single-handedly transformed the entire lawn this year. Adding new multiple new garden beds, trellises, grow-bags, and most importantly *filling them* with plants of every variety.

# Motto: Aaron's Telecommunications & Technology job

Three weeks of work down, hopefully many many more to come. Once again, I intend on keeping where I work relatively vague, as I do not ever want to give the impression my writing is in any way on the behalf of or in any way affected by the company for which I work. This company, I will refer to simply as: Aaron's telecommunications and technology employer.

My impressions from my first three weeks of work: I like it. I am still in the training portion of the job, so I can't yet say exactly what my day in and day out work is going to be like... but I am getting a pretty good idea. So far, it's very positive.

Anyways. Training has eaten up a lot of my time and energy, so it's been a while since I wrote a column. I refuse to be one of those people whose only updates are apologies for not updating more often, so I'm just going to change the subject.

There have been strong rumors of the announcement of new Nexus phone(s) at the end of this month. I am excited.

I am, to be blunt, bending over to round out my back.
I am, to be coy, feeling a little fishy.
I am, to be transparent, thinking about a decline in opacity.
I am, to be confusing,

I don't know what that was.

This column will NOT just be me recounting work and rambling about technology stuff. There is going to be LIFE STUFF on here, man. So, speaking of life stuff:

I have set about recreating an old system of mine. A life-tracking point system - the idea for which was shamelessly stolen from Demetri Martin. If you click that video, make sure to watch parts 5 and 6. I am doing that after this.

I am accruing a lot of "stuff". I am about to start making a lot of "money", so I need to be careful not to continue this trend too long. I will be drowning in my own equity. Besides,the things that you own end up owning you.

I think I'll leave off with that Fight Club reference. I like to make those.

Motto: That's MR. Gillespie to you.

  
The original title for this post was "No Wedding Talk". I opened the Column with 3 paragraphs talking about how I wasn't going to talk about the wedding. When I was done I realized I didn't have anything else to say. I have erased those words. This post will be left up for the next two weeks. I should make it a good one. Marriage. The sacred vows. The beginning of a lifelong journey. The joining of a couple in the eyes of the Lord. Two becoming one. The start of a new family. The everlasting bond. A formal, written contract stating that you intend to date the same person for the rest of your life. Wedlock. The joining of a couple in the eyes of the County Judge. Going it steady. A lucrative tax setup. The intertwining of two souls. Becoming husband and wife. The fulfillment of the necessary prerequisites to have legitimate children in the eyes of the government and most of society. Matrimony. The basis of most RomComs. Taking the plunge. Settling down. Whatever you want to call it, it's happening for me in 2 days. There's a chance you are reading this after the wedding, in which case I am a married man. Wasn't the ceremony awesome? Wasn't it cool how absolutely nothing went wrong and I didn't do anything really embarrassing? I thought that was pretty sweet. I am excited, as you might guess. I'm also exhausted, nervous, anxious, and stressed, as you might have also guessed. I knew 4 years ago that Melissa was great. I knew 3 years ago that we worked really well together as a couple. I knew 2 years ago that we could make it through any situation. I knew 1 year ago that we were getting married. I wonder what I'll know 1 year from now? 2 years from now? I wonder what I'll know 10 years from now? 20? 

We are putting the finishing touches on everything. We even had time to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. last night. That show is awesome now.  
  
**I didn't run 50 miles last month**. I ran something like 15\. Turns out I can't run much what with my arthritic back. I supplemented it by walking, bike riding, all that stuff. But, realistically, I've just been too preoccupied. It's basically a wash. I didn't make it. Maybe this month.  
  
This month I will probably have another weak goal. I'll be on a honeymoon for the first 1/3rd of the month. My goal for this month is to enjoy myself. How about that?  
  
For the next week and a half, this is me.

The main reason I was trying to write a Column that wasn't about the wedding was the Top 5 I had planned out. After 1360 XKCDs, I am finally able to put together this Top 5\. Although I gave up on not writing about the wedding, I'm not giving up on posting the following.

  
**Top 5: XKCD Fight Club References** 5\. [Old Files](http://www.xkcd.com/1360/) \- One of his "old files" is "Fight Club.wmv" 4\. [Fight Club](http://www.xkcd.com/922/) \- This comic is literally titled "Fight Club" 3\. [Model Rail](http://www.xkcd.com/878/) \- The first rule of Model Train Layouts seem familiar 2\. [Honor Society](http://www.xkcd.com/703/) \- The first rule of the Tautology club seem familiar 1\. [Spoiler Alert](http://www.xkcd.com/109/) \- the Alt-Text on this comic breaks the first two rules.

Motto: I'm Really Proud of the Title of this Post

  
Melissa and I finished our first 30 Day Challenge. Today's post will be a comprehensive review of the Paleo (+ CrossFit) challenge. For this and all future challenge posts I'm going to be using the new tag 30DAYS. That way at the end of the year you'll be able to find all the 30 Day Challenge posts easily. 

  
**The Challenge**

For thirty days, we followed the Paleo diet. This diet consists of foods that man from the Paleolithic era would likely have eaten. It removes many major staples of the Western diet - namely grains, milk, legumes, potatoes, refined salts, refined sugars, and many other things. 

  
As a supplemental goal (with an emphasis on the "mental" part), we started CrossFit. CrossFit is essentially a high-intensity approach to achieving optimal functional fitness in a minimal amount of time. You do heavy, compound lifts as quickly and as often as you can manage with proper form.

  
**The Hard Results**

The numbers don't lie. I used the Life Tracker to quantify the last 30 days, which allows me to draw the following objective results. 

  
Cheat Meals:

  
I had 17 cheat meals. The Paleo book I read suggested sticking to a 85/15 ratio. In order to meet that, I should have only had 14 cheat meals. Realistically, I only had 3 more than I should have over the course of a month; so I guess I'm pretty pleased with how well I stuck to the program.

  
Dietary Results:

[![](assets/138-1.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AAQfkVM9WDA/Uuwk3E73WZI/AAAAAAABH4g/y92AHetFemg/s1600/%23138+-+Paleo+Figure.PNG)

  
In the figure above, all the numbers in the blue represent the averages from first 6 months of Life Tracking. They do not include my Paleo numbers. The Paleo averages are universally less than the non-paleo averages, but not everything lowered by the same amount. My proteins and fats stayed much more constant than did my calorie and carb intake. I dropped my average number of carbohydrates to less than half of what they were. The sad part is that I still had more carbs than anything else.   
  
I think in a _true_ Paleo diet, you'd be getting much fewer carbs than I did. You are supposed to limit the amount of fruit you eat - which I didn't really do. I had fruit smoothies more than once a day on average. I expected my fat intake to go up, which it didn't. I think that's probably because I removed milk from my diet.  
  
No matter what, my daily caloric intake dropped below my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (as calculated by 4 of the most refutable sites I could find on the subject). I was running at a nearly 900 calorie deficit over the course of a month. So, thanks to the laws of thermodynamics, I lost weight.   
  
Body Results:  
  
I lost \~5-10 lbs. I wish I could tell you my more advanced health metrics, but I didn't have any bloodwork done. To make up for that, here's a gratuitous measure of my bodily results:  
  
  
[![](assets/138-2.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7CSVNWPNxUg/Uu2EAM9fLJI/AAAAAAABH%5FY/Oa6P8z%5FRhlM/s1600/%23138+-+Before+n+After+n+Paleo.jpg)

  
I'm disappointed with how the photo turned out, to be honest with you. I blame the change in lighting. The abs are there IRL. TMI? LOLYOLO \#FTW. Also, thanks to smaller lovehandles and a slightly broader back, my entire torso is slightly more V-shaped than it used to be, which doesn't show in that picture either.  
  
Other Number Results:  
  
My average number of Demetri goals completed per week rose by \~5%. That's not significant enough to go into in further detail. Also, eating paleo turned out to be marginally cheaper than not doing so over the course of the month. Largely thanks to the limited number of trips to restaurants.  

  
**The Subjectivities**  
So those were the hard number results, but how did living Paleo _feel_? That's the real question - and that's what I really want to talk about.  
  
Melissa and I talked at length about how Paleo changed our daily lives. All the changes were much more obvious at first than they have been since. This could be because our bodies have gotten used to the diet and have reverted back to their old ways - or it could be that we've mentally gotten used to the changes. So, what changed?  
  
Sleep:   
It came easier. It lasted longer. Waking up came easier (although it was still difficult some days). I became much less reliant on caffeine throughout the day. I didn't feel much of a _need_ for it. It helps that I don't like coffee much, and that's pretty much your only Paleo caffeine option.  
  
Stomach/Gastrointestinal Tract:  
Our guts were calm the entire month. Never once did either of us feel bloated or queasy. We both agreed that trips to the restroom had become noticeably more pleasant and consistent and then agreed never to talk about it ever again ever.   
  
Today was our first non-paleo day. We had pizza. We both feel awful. I don't think that's a coincidence.  
  
Palate:  
The food we eat normally is _crazy_ sweet. For one of my cheat meals I cheated on almond butter and instead ate peanut butter. It tasted like pure sugar. It was ridiculous. Thanks to the high-nutrient-density of the foods in the paleo diet, we got full faster and ate less. The meals were every bit as varied as our normal diet, too.  
  
It's basically impossible to eat paleo anywhere but your own kitchen. That sucked and is worth mentioning.  
  
Extra-bodily Affairs:  
Melissa and I learned a ton that we wouldn't have otherwise learned. We learned how to cook. We learned how to make _healthy_ food. We finally went to the Kansas City River Market. It's one mile away from our place and it's awesome and we never went there before. That was a run-on sentence that ended with a preposition. That was a declarative sentence that ended with the word "preposition".   
  
What was I talking about?  
  
We learned a valuable lesson about grocery shopping. If you don't _buy_ crappy food, you won't have crappy food around to tempt you. If you only buy meats and vegetables, that's all you'll have to eat. It's that simple. We learned to be more creative with our choices and more conscientious of what we put in our bodies.  
  
CrossFit:  
CrossFit is hard. I mean it is really, really difficult. Melissa and I are both tall and slender, which makes it especially difficult. If I'm doing thrusters (front squat which transitions into an overhead press) I'm moving the weight over 6 feet. Your shorter, more typical lifters are going 4.5 feet. That means I'm doing 1/3 _more work_, scientifically speaking, per rep.  
  
Even if I was built differently, CrossFit is just _hard_, dude. I'm still sore from 4 days ago. No joke.  
  
I'll write more about CrossFit in my conclusion. When you write papers, you aren't supposed to introduce new information in your conclusion. I follow my own rules. \#toughguythugmaster.  
  
**The Conclusion**  
Paleo is a great experiment. I honestly and truly believe everyone could stand to benefit from giving the paleo diet a chance. I learned so much from my experience.   
  
The Good: Paleo  
I learned how to cook dozens of new meals, all of which are very, very healthy. I learned that I can _enjoy_ healthy foods. My diet overall has way too many sugars. I lost weight. I didn't lose muscle. I slept better and felt better throughout the day.  
  
The Bad: Paleo  
I had to remove a lot of things that I don't truly believe are bad for you. For example, milk. Milk is natural. You feed it to babies to make them big, strong, and healthy. I don't follow the logic that makes milk bad for adults. Melissa refused to remove rice from her diet (although she did cut down), and I don't blame her.   
  
I don't buy the concept of paleo wholesale. While I do believe it's a much healthier diet than our typical Western one, I don't think it's the most healthy thing you can possibly do. I do believe that humans have adapted some in the past 10,000 years to eat things like rice, wheat, cheese, etc. Sure, some humans can't have those things... but I don't consider myself one of them.  
  
The Good: CrossFit  
CrossFit is a spectacular workout. They push you really hard. The community at the gym we go to is seriously phenomenal. The trainers are always right there, watching over you with a positive, helpful reinforcement. The whole place makes you feel like you are part of a team. You feel alive when you walk out the doors. Interestingly, you also feel dead.  
  
CrossFit opened my eyes to a _huge_ part of fitness that I was ignoring. It used to be that I could lift heavy weights OR jog for a long period of time. CrossFit made me realize how terrible I was at any combination of the two. From now on I will incorporate some form of CrossFit-like High-Intensity Interval Training into my workout routine. It really is the best way to achieve a high-level of overall physical fitness while keeping your workout frequency and duration at reasonable levels.  
  
The Bad: CrossFit  
CrossFit could easily be dangerous. You are doing huge, compound, technical lifts and they do push you really hard. While our trainers have done a _great_ job of watching over us at our gym, I can't say that would necessarily be the case elsewhere. Those kinds of lifts can go south _quickly_ and put you in a world of hurt. You have to be extra careful with everything you do. Operating at that level of exertion with those types of lifts is bound to bite you if you ever let your down your guard. That's why CrossFit has a reputation for causing injuries.  
  
Again, I want to stress how great the gym Melissa picked out was for both of us. We are considering renewing our membership for next month.  
  
**So. That's the end of the Paleo/CrossFit challenge.**  
  
Moving on...  
  
**The Next Challenge!**  
Melissa and I will **shut down everything with a screen at 9pm**. We are doing this for two reasons. First, **to sleep better**. Staring at bright screens late at night inhibits your brain's ability to produce important sleep hormones, thus keeping you up at night. Second, **to seize the night**. How many nights do you waste away staring at a TV or computer? We asked ourselves that and decided the answer was "too many".

  
Top 5: Final, Lasting Conclusions from the Paleo/CrossFit Challenge

5\. Paleo is a better diet than your typical modern-day Westerner's - but it's probably overkill for most peoples' circumstances.  
4\. Thanks to Paleo, both slept better at night and felt better throughout the day.  
3\. CrossFit is just as hard as I expected.  
2\. I need to incorporate a High-Intensity Interval Training circuit into my routine.  
1\. We were definitely in need of a healthier lifestyle; and doing something dramatic for a while taught us many new things that will allow us to draw our own conclusions about just how to achieve that.

Motto: I Write for Posterity  
  
Three posts in three days! I'm on a _roll_... possibly because I'm out of my routine so fully that writing has supplanted otherwise healthy tasks like cleaning and/or exercising. Note this post is crazy-long, but hopefully more entertaining than usual. I had a good time writing it.  
  
This post is a part deux. Part un happened on 11/11/2014 in [Post #219](http://www.aarongilly.com/219).   
  
I have had a Moleskine notebook for over 3 years that I've written in here or there. I started looking through it tonight and realized what I've written in there is 7 to 7.128 times better than the stuff I write on here... and my first post a year a half ago didn't cover hardly any of it. WITHOUT FURTHER DUDES, LET'S BEGIN!

# Motto: Get to It

My friend Josh did this.

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE. There was a video here. It's unavailable now. So this post is even less useful. :-(

Not that one. That's not his video. But he described to me something that sounded very similar to what that video shows.

With that spirit in mind, I'm going to go workout. If I don't, I'll look like this:

# Preamble

The things we use to shape our craft also shape our lives. We are a product of the toolset we choose, just as much as the creations we make with them. I think that's why [I've been interested in "EDC" culture for a long time](https://aarongilly.com/8/). I've spent a *lot* of time thinking about tools, looking at possession fetish sites ([Timbuk2's site](http://whatsinyourbag.com/), [/r/whatsinthebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsinthebag/), [/r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/), and [/r/EDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/edc) all come to mind. 

## Why this Post Exists  
I use a lot of things for a lot of reasons. Some of my tools are indispensable, and some I use through gritted teeth. Now that I've built a central location *(/portfolio, I guess?)* to track [the things I create](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b), I thought it would be helpful to keep track of the tools I used to create them. This was **primarily** so that I could quickly recall which coding projects I used which frameworks/toolsets/libraries on, so that I could reuse my own work... but after putting together the list I realized it may be helpful to anyone interested.

- Google Fit - never grew into anything worthwhile
- Google Keep - lacking desired functions
- Chrome Remote Desktop - Jump is much better on the iPad

End list.

# Final Words
I don't intend to keep this Column entry up-to-date with my current toolset. It's a snapshot as of 2020-09-12. I do plan, for the foreseeable future, to keep [the Notion page this Column was written in](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/Tools-41615f02a1cf4f5e80f29261a5484579) up to date.

## De-Googling  
One thing you may notice is the group of Google-related services in the "Out-of-Use" section. Google has historically been a massive, massive part of my life ("Google" used to be one of the tags I'd use for Columns). As time has gone on, though, and as Google has grown - I no longer revere the company as some sort of [pseudo God](https://churchofgoogle.org/Proof_Google_Is_God.html) (trigger warning for any fundamentalist religious types, that link is very much meant as a joke). I've seen Google make too many mistakes...

### Airing of Grievances 
* I have had too many tools I liked using yanked out from under me
* Most Google services I've been interested in never lived up to their potential
* I've grown **sick to death** of saying "Okay Google"

Long story short - yeah Google is pretty great... but not infallible.

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Currently Have
1. **Netflix** - $13/mo (standard) - it's Netflix. What are you going to do, **not** have Netflix?
2. **Spotify** Premium Family - $15/mo - simply the best music subscription service. Would be nice if they offered anything beyond "streaming audio content"... but it's a price we're willing to pay.
3. **Google One** - $10/mo for 2TB - this is essentially just Google Drive, but they wanted to make it sound like more than that.
3. **LastPass Family** - $4/mo - Password Manager. Very worth it.
4. **Glitch** - $8/mo - hosts my WebApps
**Pinecast** - $5/mo - hosts my Podcasts
**Notion** - $4/mo - hosts my notes & a lot of other stuff... although at this point they made the free version of it incredibly capable, paying isn't really necessary for the normal user
5. **Amazon Prime** - $10/mo (basically) - Amazon Prime is essentially a no-brainer for most of America. You could live pretty comfortably with ONLY an Amazon Prime subscription. They've got Prime Video (which has the best selection of kids shows), prime Music, a photo storage service, AND the free shipping. At this point I sort of see Amazon Prime's annual subscription cost sort of like "paying taxes", only instead of getting the privilege to have a military that protects us and a school system and whatnot, we get all the Amazon benefits. Same thing could be said of my Costco membership, but that's a different Top 5.

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Don't Have, but Probably Should 
1. **HBO Max** - $15/mo - this streaming service is a direct competitor to Netflix, and its catalog is incredible.
2. **Dropbox** - $10/mo for 2TB - I use Google Drive, but man do I like Dropbox. It was my first introduction to "the cloud". Also their "Paper" online document editor, while not as robust as Google Docs, is satisfying to use. It's a shame that right now Google Drive is sufficing for everything I use - and more and more we're locked into it.
3. **Apple Arcade** - $5/mo - a subscription service that nets you access to a curated library of iPhone & iPad games, all of which are free from ads & microtransactions. When my kid gets older, this is 100% happening if it's still around.
4. **YouTube Premium** - $12/mo (single) or $18/mo (family) - YouTube without ads. YouTube downloads. Also Google's Spotify competitor "YouTube Music". If this wasn't nearly $20/mo we'd probably opt in. Also if Spotify wasn't so good. Also also if I weren't 80% confident Google will see a squirrel and drop this service entirely.
5. **The Hulu/Disney Plus/ESPN bundle** - $13/mo - Hulu and Disney Plus, what else could you want? Honestly with the inclusion of ESPN here, how does ANYONE have cable still? It's either lack of good internet or fear of change. There's **no** reason to not be a cord-cutter anymore.

Motto: Seriously.

  
I'm sorry if my "write every day" goal has given you guys too much to read. I'm trying to keep each Column pretty focused, to keep from the fatigue that comes when somebody drones on.

  
I hate it when people drone on about meaningless crap; and you're like "aggh! get to the point already!".

  
Drone:

noun

(1) A low, continuous humming sound.

(2) A person who does no useful work and lives off others

(3) A remote-controlled pilotless aircraft or missile

(4) Male bee in a colony of social bees, which does no work but can fertilize the queen

(5) To speak tediously in a dull and monotonous tone

  
It's interesting how words can come to mean different things. What does a mating bee have to do with a pilotless missile? Or a continuous humming sound, for that matter? We reuse words in some of the strangest ways.

  
Iron = chemical element #26  
Iron = to smooth out  
Iron = golf club falling between the woods and putter  

  
Homonyms are dumb. Why can't we just make up new words for two of those three definitions?

  
From now on:

  
Chemical element #26 = "Iron"  
To smooth out = "Chuv"  
Golf club = "Dongley"  
  
That will make the sentence "I used my 9 dongley to chuv a situation with my iron-fisted bookkeeper" much easier to understand.  
  
This column was posted to allieviate the stretch of "meaningful", "for-purpose", or "serious" posts. Just to solidify this post's lack of seriousness, here's the picture to go out on:

Now that I've used my Chromebook for purpose, instead of just using it to try to get to know it, I've gotten to know it much better. See the Top 5.

  
Top 5: Additional Thoughts about Working on a Chromebook

5\. I haven't yet run into a situation where I've said "oh man, I need my _actual_ computer to do this." It helps that I already pretty much live in the browser and in the cloud.  
4\. I use the "home" and "end" keys a lot more than I expected I would. The Chromebook has no such keys. It will take a while to get used to Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down.  
3\. It looks nice. It feels nice. I got my second Chromebook in the mail for comparison, I'm sending it back immediately. The Toshiba Chromebook is worth the extra $80\. Using it doesn't feel like a compromise.   
2\. Three finger swipe from left to right to scroll between open tabs in the Chrome browser. This allows you to seamlessly switch back and forth between two things way easier than the Ctrl+Tab key combo. Did you know you can hit Ctrl+Tab to switch between tabs in Chrome? Try it. Ctrl+Shift+Tab lets you go backwards. It's much easier to do the 3 finger swipe, though.  
1\. Window arrangement is done intelligently. For example: if you're working on two things side-by-side, you can click the line between them to resize both of them simultaneously.  
  
Quote:   
“Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo”  
\- An example of reusing words gone overboard. This is a grammatically correct sentence that means "Buffalo (New York) bison that other Buffalo bison bully, themselves bully Buffalo bison". See [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo%5Fbuffalo%5FBuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5Fbuffalo%5FBuffalo%5Fbuffalo) for more information. -

# Motto: Hoosier Daddy?

I went to Indiana this weekend. It was good.

Anyway, on to other things...

Not really. More about Indiana. I had never made a trip like that before by myself. It was a bit empowering to know that I can brave airport reservations, timing, flight delays, ticketing, car rental, and navigation, all by myself. Well... with my phone. I consider anything I can do with my phone to be "by myself", because I think of my phone as an extension of my person. That's why I tell everyone I'm really good at division.

Actually, I was surprised how easy the whole thing was. I should probably give a quick shout-out to TripIt and their Android App. Although I could have made it without their service, it did make things markedly easier.

I got to see my girlfriend, Melissa. She is the head music lady at a camp for kids with various disabilities. Each week a new camp comes in and new kids get to have a camp experience beyond any that I ever had. The place was seriously nice. The trees and wildlife were beautiful; the kind of beautiful that you'd see in a movie and think to yourself, "yeah right. I wish life could look like that". All of the facilities and camp grounds were accessible, nice, and very well maintained. The impression made on me by the environment was only surpassed by the impression made by the staff. Never before have I seen so many selfless and amazing individuals together working as one. The staff worked together brilliantly to make camp a fun and engaging experience for children of all levels of ability. What the kids and the parents of the kids might not see is how good each of the members of the staff were as people. Each one I met impressed me with their genuinely nice disposition, care for their campers, and fun-loving attitude. Melissa fits the bill perfectly. 

I volunteered for a day. I tried to volunteer for a week and push my flight back, but apparently doing so would have cost more than the entire trip (including car rental and 2 flights) would have cost. So I volunteered for a day. At the end of that day, I felt rewarded. I felt proud. I felt like I helped. I felt exhausted. I have no idea how the counselors that work there full time can manage such high energy levels on a consistent basis. I wish I could have stayed, but I am grateful for the experience I did get.

With the weekend, Melissa and I visited Indiana University, the home of the Hoosiers. Apparently that's our thing (we spent the better portion of a day at The University of Texas when we were in Austin). It was nice.  More on-par with KU than was Texas. Texas was huge. Indiana was just "big". We watched a series of bike races after almost getting stuck in the middle of the course in the rental car somehow. Seriously, I almost hit a group of bikers in the middle of a race. We went to a genuine Drive-In movie theater and watched Pixar's "Brave". The movie was okay. The atmosphere of the drive-in was awesome. Why aren't those more popular?!

When all was said and done and it was time to fly back to Kansas, I realized I would miss that place.

I do.

Other news:
During the trip, I read a couple hundred pages of "Yes Man". I still love this book. It is NOT the story that was told in the movie staring Jim Carrey. It is a true-life story of a man who decided to say yes to everything for a year. It's comical. It's insightful. It's genius.

I like reading.

I liked this weekend.

# Top 5: Pictures from the Trip (can't show pictures of the actual camp)

5. Unless it floats on air, I'm not interested... also take notice the position of the knees in relation to both the table in its "full up-right position" and the seat in front of me. Being tall has its disadvantages sometimes.
![plane](assets/14-1.jpg)

4. Once I got there, I was taken aback by how amazingly green it was. The whole "phone/camera" thing can't even bring down its beauty.

A new Aaron Project™️[^1] has been born.

# Get in to Win

I love clever little things. I like, for example, when a URL includes the TLD[^2] in a neat way. It makes me happy.

Hence: [http://getinto.win](http://getinto.win) 

![logo](https://getinto.win/logo-300x300.PNG)

That the name and domain for my newest Aaron Project. Also it is my newest domain name purchase. I now have a handful. Probably going to hold off on others for a while (see just above the Top 10 for why). 

I plan to make a few puzzle boxes, and make them generally available for rent online. This is all incredibly early days, still not sure what it even *is*.

## The Vault

The first puzzle box is quickly approaching the playtest phase. Which is incredibly exciting… because it has taken a **lot** of work already (you may note my whole month without a Column posted). Looking very forward to watching someone actually do it. I have no idea if it will take 15 minutes or 55 minutes. That's my biggest concern at the moment. 

The first one is **too big to ship** in any cost-effective manner. I can't quite wrap my brain around how to make a SMALL box feel like is *fun* and *interesting*. A lot of the fun of the ‘escape room’ experience is the idea that *anything* could be in there. When you’re looking at box that’s the size of a toddler’s shoe box… it’s pretty clear there’s nothing large in there. Part of the benefit of taking the half-digital-half-physical approach is keeping the mystique that *anything* could happen.

Regardless, I’m sure I’ll post again once this thing becomes ‘generally available’, but that won’t be until 2023. I’ve got some stuff to work out.

Weirdly I have more ideas for my 2nd puzzle box than I do for my first. 

# Other Things

## PDW.one

I enabled basic authentication protections on my Personal Data Warehouse project, so now I feel relatively comfortable saying the URL in a public (if totally unread) setting. I’ve been building the 10th iteration of my Life Tracker/Data Journal/Personal Data Warehouse at: 

[https://pdw.one](https://pdw.one) 

If you go there now you’ll see essentially nothing. Eventually it might be useful to more people. Technically it supports multiple users right now, but you’d have to do an awful lot of playing around just to get a very restricted and buggy form of what you could get easily with Google Sheets/Airtable/Notion/Excel.

**BUT IT’S MINE DARNIT.**

## STEAM

A few years back I came across the term “STEM”, being short for “Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math”. Its meaning was clear and its applications were obvious. Nowadays, I tend to hear a different acronym more often: “STEAM”. Joining the rest is the somewhat vague addition of “Art”. This is where I became confused. What is “art”, really? What does it cover? Just the literal connotation of “the arts”? Or does it also include the *humanities*? What about history?

Another way to phrase this is: what does “STEAM” **not** refer to? When people say “STEAM” are they just using it as a shorthand for “*all non-physical educational topics*”?

I guess they stopped short of including Physical Education and (I'm assuming here) the Humanities because there isn't a cute acronym for it. 

<aside>
❓ STEEP HAM

</aside>

## iPhone 14

I got an iPhone 14 Pro to replace my iPhone 12. The cameras are gigantic. The difference between 60fps and 120fps definitely makes it “feel” smoother. 

Aside from that they are the same.

## Aaron Projects

It didn’t occur to me until after writing the **Top 10** below, there are probably too many things there. I’m doing too much. No wonder I feel like I don't have time to get everything done. 

He’s my current problem - Sophie’s choice. I genuinely don’t know what could go on the chopping block. So many of them feel foundational to how I see myself. I can’t not do the Column. I can’t not do the Life Tracking/Personal Data Warehouse thing. The Puzzle Project is my new idea. My notes are awesome. Everything else requires little to no energy to maintain, so killing them feels like a loss without much gain... who knows.

*I am in a pickle.*

Soon the homepage of this site will lose its links to my General Operating Principles and Annual Reviews, and instead have links to my Personal Data Warehouse and Get In To Win sites from above.



# Top 10: Aaron Projects

*From inactive toward most active (as of this writing).*



## 10. My Second a Day Videos

Paused for the past couple years. Would like to return to them soon.



## 9. My Workbenches

These are *mostly* done. They are on an indefinite pause until such a time as I get bored. Then I will finish up Shirley and paint them. Or not.



## 8. The We Scene a Movie Podcast

Paused for the past month+. I think we're returning to this soon for an episode or two (House of the Dragon and probably Wakanda Forever).



## 7. [Wrapper-Lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrapper-lib)

A home-grown coding library. Been adding tiny little incremental releases as I work on the projects below and stumble across new feature ideas. 



## 6. The 30 Day Challenges

These have been going on being the scenes for the past many years. They have grown less and less like “ambitious challenges” and more and more like a mechanism of focus.



## 5. The [Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b)

This is meant to be a catalog of the stuff I do for all the other entries here. I like this one a lot. It’s low-effort.



## 4. My [Notes](https://www.notion.so/316dc92305c54dbc82d755bd9646b790)

I just crossed the 1000 note threshold during the writing of this post.



## 3. The [Column](https://aarongilly.com/)

This thing!



## 2. The [Personal Data Warehouse](https://pdw.one)

My Life Tracking Data Journal. Currently it's 10 iteration rewrite. Using a ton of the same tools and techniques I made



## 1. Get in to Win

I wrote about this all above.

# Motto: Using segways to make random topics seem related…

To get started, here’s a few brief update bullets about my life: 1. Thanksgiving happened. This means I had my first day of paid vacation. I’m got paid to not come in to work. I’M GETTING PAID TO NOT COME INTO WORK. This is huge. Consequences will never be the same. 
2. This past weekend I spent at Melissa’s place in Topeka. They taught me spades. Spades is basically “hearts”, but with partners and some of the rules are different. Spades and Hearts are related about as much as Football and Rugby…. I assume. I don’t know anything about Rugby. Either way, the group had a really good time. Melissa and I are the undefeated/undefeatable lightweight Spades champions of the world.
3. I’m glad I got to see my family. Jon is coming up here now and I get some more face time with the rest of them on Sunday.

Speaking of “face time”, I got to use Google’s version of Apple’s “Facetime” in a new way last night. A bit of background: Skype is the big name in VoIP calling and video chatting right now. Skype is quickly seeing its services being cannibalized by the likes of Apple’s native Facetime video chat and Google’s Google Voice and Google Hangouts. Hangouts are essentially group video chat sessions… for free. Each person has their own video feed at the bottom of the screen. Whoever is talking at any given time gets displayed full screen. This updates constantly, so the person doing the most talking is always at the center of the screen. This allows for a very natural multi-person conversation to take place. I have played around with these hangouts before, but never with more than one person. Last night I got that opportunity with a group Hangout with the entire Hill tribe. It was one of those rare transformative experiences when technology transcends “this gadget is so cool” into the realm of “this whole thing is so cool”. I would love to make Hangouts with groups of friends a much more regular thing. Anyone with Google+ can do it.

Speaking of Google+, everyone should use it. I’m not saying “make it your new Facebook”. I’m saying, use it for its intended purpose. Share things you find online with those that actually care. Share pictures with those that actually care. Do hangouts. I’m not going to harp on it any longer… but it is honestly the best, most natural way to share things online and it’s my favorite new Google service of the past 2 years.

Speaking of new Google services – they have created something new that’s unlike anything they’ve done before… a game. The game is called “Ingress” and is currently an invite-only affair. I don’t have an invite and haven’t played, but, from what I’m gathering, it’s a really cool idea. It combines gaming with the real world on a level way above that of any other game ever created. Essentially, you are one of two sides fighting a battle for global domination through mind-control. This “globe” I speak of isn’t some fictional map made by a game developer, it’s a fictional layer placed on the actual world we live in. You play though your Android device. It shows you an overhead view of the area you are currently in, complete with some objectives and points of interest. In order to play, you have to be physically AT these objectives. It’s a really weird combination of augmented reality, role-play gaming, teamwork, and physical exercise. It’s a game that is quite literally on a global platform. I will be playing as soon as I can.

Speaking of games I will be playing soon, TWO games got released a few days back for the PlayStation that I want. This is weird because not even one game since the release of Battlefield 3 over a year ago has managed to spark even a glimmer of interest for me. Now, we have PlayStation’s version of Nintendo’s very awesome “Super Smash Brothers” franchise, and the first new game in the “Hitman” franchise in over 6 years. The last time I played those games I had no job.

Speaking of jobs, I like mine.

Speaking of my job, I am using my new hookups to get an awesome data plan for my awesome cellular Nexus 7.

Speaking of awesome, I am happy. You hear “awesome”. I hear “Aww, soo me”. As in, “that’s so me” . As in, “I’m awesome”. Yeah.
I’m going to end this column now, because I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and gosh-darnit people like me.

# Motto: ~145 hours

That's how long it's been since I initially thought this:

"I'm really really tired... and it's freezing in here... and I'm sore everywhere for no reason...... oh crap."

The first 3 full days I was sick. At the time, I thought I was pretty much out of the woods. I'm here right now 3 full days later to tell you, I was wrong.

Friday night I acquired cheap tickets to the semi-final games of the Big-12 tournament. I attended them. Felt somewhat tired, but otherwise okay. Saturday I woke up feeling worse... but it was my newphew's 4th birthday and I had already missed out on the official party, so I decided I really needed to go home and see the family.

That ended up being probably a mistake. Don't get me wrong, I did get to see them and I am happy about it; but I spent most of the time asleep. I think I may have even fevered up again at one point. I didn't measure.

I'm getting a doctor's appointment ASAP. This "24 or 48 hour bug" has turned into a week-long affair.

I should be playing basketball with AJ and Nick right now. I hate being sick.

KU beat KSU in the Big 12 Tournament Championship. We share the regular season championship with them, despite having beaten them 3 times and lost to them 0 times this year.

Here's where we're at. 

# Change... Again

I started my [last post](https://aarongilly.com/410/) off with a section about change and how *everyone I know is in the midst of some big life-altering change*. Well, I'm here to talk about change again, but from a wholly different perspective:

Change is **scary**.

## Physical Change

### Age

I'm getting older. 

It turned out I **loved** being in my 20s. That's quickly approaching *"not even the recent past any more"* status.  

When I wrote [Column #103](https://aarongilly.com/103/) I was halfway to 50. That felt fine to me. Now I'm halfway to 65 and it feels *less fine*. At 25 I was still pretty much invincible, despite my back ailment. From Column #103:



> What I can’t believe is that before I turn fifty I will get to live another day for each day I have been already been alive. I will have at least my current level of understanding and faculty, my current level of independence and capability. - me at 25

Well I was wrong. I hope I wasn't wrong about the *quantity* of days I'll be living again - I'd certainly love to make it past 50 - but about how those days would be lived. Here's a point-by-point takedown of what I wrote nearly 8 years ago. 

- **Understanding** - While I understand *more* about the world now than I did when I was 25, but also I know I've forgotten things, too. I remember what a Fourier Transform *is*... but not at all *how* to do one. So, the blanket statement "having my current level of understanding" is off-base, at best. Also, I've come to be of the opinion that knowledge acquisition behaves like a fractal. You don't understand a topic. So you do research and get a base-level understanding of the *basics*, but now realize there's many more layers of the onion and you don't begin to understand those. It's a question Hydra. If you answer a question, two more shall take its place.
- **Faculty** - 'Anomia' is the word for when you forget words for things. I feel like it's already starting to creep in. Meanwhile my propensity to use $5 words has only really *increased*. It's like I'm shifting easy language out of the register as I push more recently-acquired words and phrases into it. Also my mental math game has lost its giddy-up[^1].
- **Independence** - This one is interesting. In one sense, I'm wonderfully independent and capable as a functional adult. In another sense, I can only **really** do something if I have considered those who now depend on *me*. I'm independent insofar as I could survive in modern society quite well without need for outside assistance, but I'm *definitely* not able to function "independently". The dependence directionality has changed, and with it the kinds of restrictions that are imparted, but it's still certainly there... moreso than before, even.
- **Capability** - this one is by far and away the most wrong. At 25 I was basically invincible *(aside from that pesky little [incurable auto-immune disease](https://aarongilly.com/312) thing)*. If I felt pain, there was some acute *reason* I could point to that caused it. Now, if I sit in a chair for slightly too long, all my ligaments and tendons decide "you know what? We like this exact position. Maybe we just stay in this position *forever*". I work out multiple times a week to maintain capability, but even with enduring work ethic I will need to be **very lucky** if I'm wish to continue to things at 50 that were easy to me at 25.

Such is life. You literally cannot have it all. I am incredibly lucky that I was and am capable of choosing the path I walk. And every day I wake up next to the person I wake up next to, and see the boys I choose to bear, I am reminded how good of a job I've done choosing my life thus far.

### Parenthood

My children are growing. I'm still getting used to the concept of even saying I **have** children, and yet one of them is talking up a storm and the other just started crawling a couple weeks back. Literally every day I think to myself "soak in this time, you won't be able to do this again". I love my boys, and I know I'll love the men they grow up to be - I'm just not ready for it yet.

Again, such is life.

### Housing

We painted our current house. It looks very different now and I like that. Makes me want to *immediately* make a similar change to our new house whenever we move in... if we move in. There is no reason to think we *won't*, but circumstances near me have reminded me just how quickly everything can go sideways. 

## Technological Change

### Google Lock-In

Google Drive *(& Photos)* remains the sole reason for our continued "trial" qualifier on Melissa & my big trial switch to all-Apple services. You'd think a guy who [writes about future-proofing your files](https://aarongilly.com/408/) would be better-prepared for something like this. Alas, the problem is bigger than "particular preferred formats" - it's a total change in *mindset*. 

The "Google Way" is to have all your stuff accessible in their servers, associated with your account. If you want to download static copies of your documents, you're welcome to do that... but the canonical copy will reside squarely **online**. If you're sharing a Google Photos photo with someone, you're not creating a "copy" of that photo and sending them the *copy*, you're adding their name to a list associated with the photo's URL that says "this account can see this content, too". **I do really like this approach.** It's elegant and scales well.

Beyond that, they have trained us to just keep *everything*. Don't bother organizing photos or pruning out things you *may* not need in the future, because who knows what you'll need and you'll be able to find whatever it is thanks to their image recognition search interface, which is truly second-to-none.

Plus my password manager tells me I currently have 109 log-ins using my gmail account. So there's that, too.

### Windows 11

Microsoft is moving on from Windows 10. They are introducing a *genuinely big* visual overhaul. The start menu isn't in the bottom-left anymore, for one. Their building teleconferencing *into* the Operating System. I'm just not sure how on-board I will be for that. I don't love the fact that there are so many people trying to become "the" teleconferencing app of choice for regular consumers. Let's Facetime/Zoom/Hangouts/Duo/Meet/Skype/Teams[^2] about it sometime.

In the meantime, I'm expecting to this desktop PC to give up the ghost sometime in the next 1-2 years. Who knows what will replace it.

And now, for something complete unrelated.

# An Idiot Who Ruined a Race

If you've got nothing nice to say about someone, don't say anything at all.

I have nothing to say about this idiot:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dFwc9_6J_QWW7M2hMiplREnUeGyw1GM3tBOdtVrazNYv7j7XjQ8-ZDSuuMTa9cj_5mtdFLsqTxb7pvfgIp9VyLKgtyD0ln-pfa1b8E113ixQYabXY01KLTMBK11wFlCM_2oFZic173uHmMzsEEE9VEoA=w864-h498-no?authuser=0](assets/411-1.png)

**For posterity:** In case this doesn't have the Zeitgeist-impact I expect it will, this idiot wanted to send the functional equivalent of a "hi mom!" message to her grandparents. So she stepped out onto the road in front of the most famous bike race, stuck her stupid sign literally in front of the race made herself unavoidable, and caused dozens of bicyclists to crash, several injuries, including at least one person who had to drop out of the race entirely. 

I don't really care about bicycle racing or the Tour De France specifically, but I do **immensely** care about months-to-years of grueling preparation by many people in service of their life's dream, *wasted* by an idiot who wanted to be on TV. I hope this individual is identified, shamed publicly, and subject to whatever consequences those in charge believe to be appropriate.



# Top 5: Active-ish Projects in My Personal Pipeline



## 5. This Column

Hey! One of these I'm going to finish soon. 



## 4. Several [Gillespedia](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/) Articles

Data. Data parsing. Databases. The internet. Triangles. Infinity. Articles about all of those things are at some stage of development.



## 3. Going All-In on Apple

This project is heavily stalled at the aforementioned Google Drive → iCloud step.



## 2. Selling a House & Buying a House

"Moving" is typically considered one of the Top 5 most-stressful life events, depending on which source you trust. There's a lot to it, on both sides.



## 1. Data Journal Feature-Completeness and the Personal Data Warehouse

I have a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) & [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_united_states_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongo%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624338&gclid=CjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOlcjF9nWIgIRla_CFaADIfoabSmSoXQoYOkhAk19Y7mmQ_bU5UW-aRoCU9cQAvD_BwE)-based Webapp that is nearing feature-completeness. It has been my "Life Tracker" for the past year+ now, but it's still missing some things. Namely the creation of wholly new types tracked things is not simple. Importing data remains fairly unintuitive and tedious. And there is no user interface for "drawing charts" yet. All of these things are on the cusp of being developed.

The next logical extension of the "Data Journal" is the complete abstraction of the concept from the specific services that support it. Frankly I've done a pretty okay job of keeping the programming modular, but it remains pretty tightly-bound with its current setup. I want to package it up and make it more portable for better future-proofing. Also I want to write it in Python, just as an excuse to finally use Python for something.

# Motto: Knowledge comes from experience. Experience comes from doing things.

You like that motto? I thought of it myself. It actually has been my motto over the past couple months or so. This marks the first time I put a real motto in the spot where I put my "motto". My new motto: That won't happen again.

Motto.
Motto.
Muh auto.

If you say a word too much, it stops sounding real.

The motto is a reference to my desire to be a great writer. One who could write down his thoughts and have them read by people, even if they weren't good thoughts. I can't become a great writer without writing great things. In order to write great things, you have to write a lot of bad things first. It's kind of like how when you go to a new place you have to be lost for a little bit before you can know where you are. That's the driving force behind this column. Writing for writing. Writing about writing. Metawriting. The kind of writing that is fun to read. The kind that leaves people wanting more. The kind that sticks with you when you're done. That's the kind of writing I want to be capable of.

You aren't supposed to end sentences with prepositions.
You aren't supposed to start start sentences with "because".
Because I do those things, much guilt I have.

I'm going to end this trek into the wildly mediocre with a short limerick which I will make up now.

Googled "limerick" to verify rhyme scheme,
Wikipedia article's sublime dream.
But don't rely on those,
they're written by bozos.
Academically akin to a crime scene.

So it wasn't great.
You try writing one better.
Haikus are so dumb.

I'm also thinking about writing because I located my old green notebook in which I used to do a lot of it. Not "poetry" type writing, usually... more like... nerd writing. Here is a picture of it next to my new tablet case. Notice how they compliment each other? That was accidental.

# Catching Up on Life

## Vacation Brain

Been doing lots of your typical American summertime vacation things lately. 

South Dakota. 

The Lake of the Ozarks. 

Las Vegas. 

Every single one of those trips we have friends to thank for. Vacations are good. Friendship is even better.

## Barbenheimer

On Monday we did a movie date double-feature - the full Barbenheimer. I went in expecting to enjoy Barbie, but appreciate Oppenheimer. I walked out both enjoying ***and*** appreciating Barbie, but only really appreciating Oppenheimer - and not quite to the extent that I was hoping. I get that Christopher Nolan was making a movie about Oppenheimer the ***man***, not Oppenheimer the creator of the atomic bomb… but still it surprised me how little the movie cared about the actual *bomb*. It was more about the relationships Oppenheimer had with the people around him, which I guess I should have expected and shouldn't have been disappointed by, but I can't help it. I was a bit let down. 

Meanwhile, Barbie, which is a movie that **should** be *terrible*, was really surprisingly great. It was well written, very funny, and managed to do a good job of making you feel things. It’s crazy to me, but I’d 100% watch Barbie again - but I’m not sure I’ll ever make time for a second round of Oppenheimer.

**In short:**  
- Barbie - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2[^1]   
- Oppenheimer - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

## Water Bottle Analysis 2023

Thanks to my new brother-in-law, I bought a new water bottle I definitely needed for sure 100% definitely. It’s a very new and exciting entry into the pantheon of water bottles I’ve collected with varying characteristics. I got jealous of Melissa’s Stanley cup (which are super popular around here) and had to get my own new shiny object.

![Water Bottle Lineup](/assets/images/440.png)

| Brand          | Hydro Flask | Hydro Flask | Ice Shaker | Nalgene | (???) | Hydro Flask |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Capacity (oz)  | 64          | 40          | 36         | 32      | 29    | 24          |
| Insulated      | ✅           | ✅           | ✅          | ❌       | ✅     | ✅           |
| Packable       | ✅           | ✅           | ✅          | ✅       | ❌     | ✅           |
| Cup holder fit | ❌           | ❌           | ✅          | ❌       | ✅     | ✅           |
| Weight (g)     | 777         | 493         | 603        | 171     | 460   | 391         |

The Ice Shaker has been my favorite lately. It’s a *bit* heavy, but absolutely perfect for daily usage. If I were going on a trip I *might* still default to the 24oz Hydro Flask, or the Nalgene for a hike… but pretty much every other bottle up there has limited utility at this point. Since I got my newest water conveyance vessel I’ve easily kept my >100oz/day [Streak](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692) going.

Not included above, literally a dozen other water bottles I’ve owned in the past 20 years that I’ve not held onto… nor the 3+ other Nalgenes I own.

I like water bottles. It’s a good idea to splurge a little bit on things that reinforce good behaviors.

## Life with Exercise.

The worst injury I’ve sustained in over 20 years happened silently. I didn't even know about it until the next day. It was two months ago now that the digging and concrete messed up my back and neck. 

Only two weeks ago did I feel able to start trying to properly workout again. I’ve been trying to do a nice balance of things, a little weekly 3-2-1:

- 3 days with weightlifting
- 2 days with cardio
- 1 day of mobility work

I’ve been successful with that these past two weeks. Going to keep those streaks alive as long as I can, again shout out to [Streaks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692). I like using a streak-per-workout-type setup because it gets 6 workouts in per week, but also allows for multiple types of workouts to be done on the same day. 

Life with exercise is so, **so** much better than life without. I sleep easier. I can manage anxiety. I am capable of being happy while simply sitting on a chair doing nothing. While the actual *process* of exercise is something you have to learn to like[^2], the time in-between is so easy to fall in love with.


# Catching Up on Projects

## PDW

I’m still enjoying working on my Personal Data Warehouse a few hours a week. I’ve set a new goal to have the project done this quarter *(by 2023-10-01)*. So [Column #](435https://aarongilly.com/435/) will, if I’m successful, be followed up on around the start of October. Get excited to skip over that one. 

## Notion → Obsidian Notes Transition

For reasons I mentioned in [my previous Column](https://aarongilly.com/439), I recently finished switching my body of 1096 personal permanent “atomic notes” from Notion to Obsidian. I’ve essentially settled into Obsidian at this point. It’s not perfect, but neither was Notion (for this use case). I’ve written **72 new notes** in the past 19 days since I switched. So that’s a good sign. 

I like Obsidian better as a host for my notes. For everything else, Notion is still king. Speaking of which…

## Notion Productivity Stack

Last week I wasted ~3 days messing with my personal productivity stack. I toyed briefly with moving parts of it out of Notion. That wasn’t going to be easier, so then I set to tinkering inside of Notion’s toolbox. Long story short, I wound up (essentially) making a giant circle coming back to basically where I started. I won’t go into it here, maybe later. I should revisit [Column #385](http://aarongilly.com/385/) sometime.

## Get in to Win

I haven’t touched my in-development puzzle box in a few months now. I’m still 100% doing it. It’s just been put on the back-burner in the name of ‘fewer arrows, more wood’ here recently. I’m also thinking about transitioning the website and the name of the project from *Get in to Win* to *Aaron’s Puzzles*. It’s not catchy, but neither was get in to win.



# Top 5: Lessons My Brain Refuses to Learn



## 5. Solved problems don’t need new solutions

I’m a problem-solving hammer. Sometimes nails I’ve driven in have worked themselves loose. More often than not, though, they don’t. This doesn’t stop me from hammering them in again. I solve the problem again, only to realize I’ve created a minor variation of a thing I’d done before.

See: “Notion Productivity Stack” from above.

See also: Water bottle analysis from above, and [Column #373](https://aarongilly.com/373-simplicity-embracing-good-enough/).



## 4. Make smoothies. They’re good.

Smoothies are a treat. They are also a good way to sneak in veggies and vitamins and protein powders. Every time I remember to make one I enjoy it. Then I forget about the existence of the smoothie as a concept for weeks.



## 3. Presence

Being here. Right here right now. It’s so “easy”, right? 

Are you aware of your surroundings? What can you hear? What can you see, beyond this text? What can you feel?

I’ve definitely gone entire *days* before not having really just stopped to smell the roses. I don’t recall having smelled a single thing today, actually. Sad.



## 2. Just do a little bit, very consistently

I don’t like transitions. I am very good at sticking with one task, one activity for a *very* long time. This, though, isn’t the best way to do, well, a lot of things. Instead I tend to get stuck working on one particular thing, or doing one particular thing, until my neck has a bulging disc. By the time I come back up for air switching between projects, I’ve completely forgotten where I was. 

James Clear (and David Allen, in a different way) would tell you that *the best way to a LOT is by doing just a little very, very consistently.*



## 1. Cuticles

Messing with them is causing 100% of the problem you’re trying to fix when you mess with them. Marla.

# Motto: SUPERnerdy

Today's post is brought to you by Marvel's cinematic universe. I will be writing exclusively about past, present, and future movies based off comic books. If it looks too long and you lack interest in the subject, this might be a good one to skip. Having said that, if you are at all interested in the subject, I think I've actually done a stellar job with this column. Now, without further ado:  I love superheroes. I love superhero stories. Nothing offers pure, enjoyable, escapist entertainment quite like a fantastical tale of good versus evil. Superhero stories, for the most part, are just stories. They aren't out to change your life. They don't take themselves too seriously. They are just meant to be simple entertainment; and there's something to be said about that.  I approach this subject as a watered-down, modern-day comic book nerd who isn't keen on reading actual comic books. Growing up, I was a huge fan of Spiderman and the X-Men. I'd watch their cartoons every weekend. If something made me miss their cartoons (my sister's nonstop involvement in every sport ever conceived of and/or my involvement in Boy Scouts) I'd complain and moan and generally try to find a way out of it (I never made it past Cub Scout mostly for this reason). I quite vividly remember playing videogames with my cousins and being so thrilled that I was Wolverine. That excitement never really changed. I have a high-level knowledge of the publication history and different story arcs of the superheroes I'm a fan of, but I've never actually sat down to try to read them. One could spend (waste) an entire lifetime reading all the books across the different series or different instantiations of the same series that exist. I don't have time for that. I have other things in my life - but I still appreciate a good superhero story. So, being as though I'm a bit of a film buff anyway, I've really reduced it down to watching and appreciating superhero movies. And let me tell you, I'm a fan.  "Super Hero" is a trademark co-owned by DC and Marvel comics. They are to superheros stories what Coke and Pepsi are to soft drinks. You can find find members of each class that aren't owned or produced by one of the two big companies... but they aren't nearly as culturally significant as the ones that are. Shasta and Hellboy will never be as important as Diet Coke and Batman.  Between the two biggest brands in comic books there exist hundreds and hundreds of superheroes - but not all are created equal. When it comes to movies, DC really only has Superman and Batman to work with. Batman has been done several times over during my lifetime (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale). The most recent trilogy, much to Christopher Nolan's credit, was fantastic. There hasn't yet been a good Superman movie made since I've been alive (here's to hoping "Man of Steel" changes that). Every other character they have doesn't make for good movies (see the Green Lantern for evidence of that). That's pretty much it for DC. They are important, but not my favorite.  Marvel Comics is responsible for Spiderman, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men, and many more (Blade, Ghost Rider, and the Punisher come to mind). Their characters, for the most part, exist within a single, cohesive "Marvel" universe, full of individual stories. This transitions over to film well. With the exception of Dare Devil, Elektra, and that one Hulk with Eric Bana, their movies have been almost unanimously good.  Sometime in late 2007 or early 2008 I was reading about the upcoming Iron Man movie when I stumbled across the master plan that later became known as The Avengers, phase one. The notion of several movies that each tell their own story with their own characters being linked together to create a single, larger storyline blew my mind. Doing this, the movies become much more like the comic books off which they are based. They tell individual stories that contribute to a bigger picture. Similarly, earlier this month I heard that the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past is a bridge between the X-Men movies of the 2000's and 2011's "First Class". Actors from both franchises are set to reprise their roles to establish a clear overall storyline.  All is not perfect, though. Marvel has sold off rights to their characters to various studios to stay afloat throughout the past 20 years. Spiderman belongs to Sony. The Fantastic Four and the X-Men belong to Fox. Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, and the rest of the Avengers have belonged to Universal, Paramount, and most recently, Disney. Unfortunately this creates three siloed universes for character sets that were built and designed to go together. Spiderman and Wolverine (along with several other X-Men, actually) have both been popular members of the Avengers comic books at various points in time. Extremely unfortunately, this is unlikely to ever happen in the current films.  Instead, we will have Sony continually turning out Spiderman movies where Spiderman exists in a world all by himself. Fox will realize their goal of uniting the X-Men universe - and, if rumors are true, introduce a rebooted Fantastic Four into that same universe (that is, the Fantastic Four would be aware of the existence of the X-Men and the two could franchises would be open to interweaving). Lastly, Disney will continue doing their thing with The Avengers.... That thing they are doing, by the way, is nothing short of the most interesting thing I've ever seen in cinematic history.  The Avengers was huge. The project was a grand, moonshot-type idea. The implementation was, in my opinion, nearly flawless. The Hulk and Iron Man's friend James Rhodes have both been played by different actors depending upon which movie you are watching... but other than that, retention has been perfect. Beyond the fantastic retention and forethought in contract writing, each of the origin movies were really good. Their climax, 2012's "The Avengers" was awesome... but it was just phase one.  Phase two has already begun. Iron Man 3 is coming out in a little over a week. It introduces Iron Man's arch-nemesis, "the Mandarin" for the first time and it will handle the whole "how do you have a superhero movie after the Avengers?" thing. Next will be Thor: The Dark World, which released its initial trailer the other day. It is set to take place NOT on earth (which was the often-cited low point of the first Thor) and will star all its original actors. Beyond that, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is currently filming. Details on this movie are limited, other than we know it will take place in modern-day and include Scarlette Johansson starring again as the Black Widow. Lastly, A new dimension of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be unveiled. "Guardians of the Galaxy" will introduce a supplemental hero team (which, admittedly, I know very little about) to the canon* story. It is set to release on my 26th birthday and will likely include Thanos, the mysterious evil character who smiles at the end of 2012's "The Avengers". This all will culminate in The Avengers 2 (insert subtitle here) in which the Avengers will likely face off with Thanos in a story that involves the all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet. I'm going to include one brief tidbit about Thanos right before my Top 5. The Avengers 2 will be released in 105 weeks (but who's counting?).   * Canon - in this context canon is an adjective that essentially means "fits with the rest of the timeline or story, part of the same universe".  Then we begin phase three. Phase three will reportedly introduce at least two new characters from the vault of former members of the Avengers - Ant Man and Dr. Strange. The Ant Man movie will be the first out of the gate, and that's all anyone knows for right now about phase three. It seems logical that it would include at least a Hulk movie (he has no solo movie in phase two) if not new movies from other, previously established Avengers characters. It also seems logical that it would all end with The Avengers 3.  Personally, I hope to see Marvel and Disney live out this vision and make it through three Avengers movies without losing their gusto or the actors that play their heroes. Cinematic history has already been made with the first Avengers movie - but if they manage to pull together a supertrilogy (I just coined that term, you heard it here first) they will have completed a feat that will likely NEVER be surpassed or repeated in Hollywood. If they can keep up the quality and integrity of the canon storyline, keep the original actors on board, and keep things cohesive, I think we will all have a very pleasant next 6 or 7 years.  If Sony decided to collaborate, or sell off Spiderman so he could join the party... and if Fox did something similar with their characters, I... I just... I don't have words for how cool that would be.  My interesting tidbit about Thanos - Thanos is motivated by an unrequited love for the physical manifestation of Death. You see, the Marvel Universe in some instances offers up its own mythologies. Death is personified as a woman-like being of some sort that oversees all existence (along with other entities, such as "Eternity"). Thanos loves her and wishes to honor her or win her over by sending her as many people as he can. THIS IS WHY, at the end of "The Avengers" when the mysterious Other tells Thanos attacking Earth is tantamount to courting Death, Thanos smiles. He smiles because he wishes to do exactly that, literally court with lady Death.   Hopefully that made you appreciate the geniusness of The Avengers a little bit more.

# Fact: I've tracked 35 days

# Motto: Know Thyself

A little over one month ago I put into action a plan to better understand and manage my life. [Thirty-one days ago I wrote]({{siteurl}}/83):
The goal of the LTS is to audit my life in the four distinct areas I've determined have the greatest significance or impact. I want to track the following:

* Diet - Garbage in, garbage out. What you eat is what you are.
* Exercise - If you don't use it, you lose it.
* Money - I'm spending how much on what?!?
* Demetri - My list of 25 things a "good" person would do every day.

In doing so I hope to gain a greater sense of self, a greater handle on the important things in life, and use this knowledge to make intentional and positive changes in my life.
And for the past month I've done just that. Here's what I've learned about myself:

## Diet:

![](assets/92-1.jpg)

My three favorite things
I eat better than I would have expected. Of course, I have altered my eating habits drastically during the past month. I have had little to no frozen or fast foods. My smoothie intake has skyrocketed. 

![](assets/92-2.png)

Diet results from month one
I used 3 different online calculators to determine my goal caloric intake. 3000 was actually a step down from the average they suggested; and I can't even get 2500 consistently. If you aren't eating fast food or drinking soda, it's hard to get more than 2500. I did manage to get 3700 on a few occasions, but never in a healthy manner (I LOVE pizza). I'm going to lower my goal some.

Somehow I've managed to exactly nail my goal fat intake. I accurately predicted I was going to exceed my carb limit and not quite meet my protein objective. I got a little closer than I expected, though.

Note: During the past month I've gained ~5 pounds. This officially put me at my goal weight of 100 kg. Now I can say "I'm over 2 m tall and 100 kg".

Second note: Most people I know won't have any idea how much 100 kilograms actually is. It's 220.5 pounds.

## Exercise:

![](assets/92-3.png)

Still from one of my unused "second of the day"(s)
I worked out an average of **4.2** times per week. I also tracked my actual exercises. I found out first-hand what I had been told so many times in my life - *if you track your lifts, you can intentionally increase your weight/reps and get stronger!* I almost never failed to lift more in successive exercises. For a little while now, I've bordered on possibly looking strong... but, for the first time in my life, I've actually felt strong. 

Not everything went perfectly, though. I very stupidly stopped warming up before my workouts. Last week I experienced what I have determined to be exercise-induced exertion headaches. After some Googling, I have decided to take a week or two off from weightlifting and shift my focus to cardio and flexibility. I'll ease back into lifting soon.

Note: I went for a run just before writing this column. First one in a while. I'm out of shape.

## Money:

![](assets/92-4.jpg)

This picture was taken over 6 years ago
I spend too much.

In fairness, though, during the past month I splurged on myself an unusual amount. I have a wedding and a car coming up soon. I saw this as my last opportunity with any "fun money" and decided to make the most of it. Besides, I won't be a bachelor much longer.

I'm not going to delve any farther into my personal finances on the internet. I'm keeping good track. I'm on top of things. And that's all that matters.

## Demetri:

![](assets/92-5.png)

A still from [the stand-up routine that started all of this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=NzsEtafv-FA#t=408s)

The Demetri List is nothing new. I've actually been doing it on and off for a couple of years now. What's interesting is the comparison of my performance from before I started tracking everything to now. I've lived a (slightly) more disciplined life in the past month. How has that affected things?

![](assets/92-6.png)

Each category has a maximum possible score of 35 - for a total maximum of 35x5 = 175
My productivity has gone up across the board. Keen observers may say "*no no no, your 'Mind' category actually dropped*". To them I respond by saying "*I no notice, I'm not do good with mind lately*".

Really though, the dip in my average "Mind" score comes from an increase in goal difficulty. The version of the Demetri List I've been using for the past month is new. Almost every goal is a little harder to accomplish, "Mind" in particular was made much more difficult. I replaced "Cut down on multitasking" with "read for more than 20 minutes". Changed "worked on a project" to "worked on a non-column project". I added a stipulation to "learned/practiced something" that it now has to be something useful. In short, the data doesn't show the whole story there.

Unsurprisingly, the area that saw the biggest increase was "Manage" (which I'm only now realizing should be called "Management"). If you are constantly recording what you do, it's becomes much easier to manage what exactly that is.

Overall, I'm running at 51.4% of maximum possible productivity. Note that "maximum possible" does not equal "maximum feasible". I've never accomplished all 35 goals in one day - it's really hard. 

Maybe tomorrow.

# Wrap Up:

Overall - the Life Tracking System has been a huge success and personal triumph. I have definitely developed a greater sense of self from a managerial perspective; and I have definitely improved my overall health and wellness. I still have greater goals and I'm still going to keep pushing forward. I see no reason to stop tracking life any time in the near future. 

Honestly, I could have written a lot more about it.

# Unrelated Site News:

I am introducing a new label - FEATURE. During each Feature Column I will choose a general theme, then try to cover that theme in both a complete and entertaining way. These themes will not be specific to me (like, say, my well-documented month); instead, they will be things everyone can relate to (for examples, see the Top 5). I'm retroactively applying the FEATURE label to [Column #82]({{siteurl}}/82) - Superheroes as it perfectly exemplifies what I'm talking about.

# Top 5: Possible Future Features
5. "Big Brother"
4. Dogs
3. Movies
2. Tools
1. Intelligence (I actually already started writing this)

I felt like giving a general update to the internet about the status of my nouns. TL;DR: - they're good!

# People 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

I am good. I feel healthy. My family is in a really good routine lately. Exercising enough. Eating decently healthy. Getting the chance to spend quality time together every day. I reckon this is what life is about.

My wife is great. **She doesn’t get enough love on here.** It’s occurring to me only as I write this sentence that this post will be the post that’s most recent during Valentine’s Day. I should have probably capitalized on that. She’s awesome, though. She competed in the finals at an **international** Sweet Adeline's competition this past year in a quartet **and** with her chorus… and her chorus placed in the Top 10. Internationally. Teams that beat them were from Sweden for goodness sake. It takes people from halfway around the world to even compete. That’s more impressive than anything I know how to do.

My kids are great. My oldest started playing soccer. He’s still young, though. It’s more like he’s playing “go kick the ball maybe”, the game where the rules are optional and the points don’t matter. My younger is basically potty trained at this point. They are both growing a little bit each day. Every day feels wondrous. Perhaps because so many of them include the Curious George theme song at the beginning.

My *other* family is also great. My cousin/brother is going to become a dad. My parents are engaged in the lives of their kids and grandkids. They’re constantly helping out and I’m constantly humbled by how considerate and great they are. My newest family all seem to be on paths toward fulfillment. New marriages. New significant others. New shared hobbies. Life is looking up. 

I’m reminded that each day here is not guaranteed. Love those that you have like today was the last time you could. Nobody can hear this advice enough. People are what life is about.

# Places 🏠

Our house is a never ending source of work to be done… but also I’m grateful to be able to do the work. You can love something *and* want it to be better. That's what we have going on here. The ranch style house is still something I appreciate, compared to my previous house. It’s so easy to feel connected to the people living here.

The shower is a work in progress. Has been for about 2 years now. And when I say “about”, I mean “more than”. That’s a story for another day.

# Things ⌚️

Things are in a good spot. I’m talking about the things I own. They are good. They are enough. More than enough, really. See the quote. The first one.

We got a Blackstone griddle for Christmas. It has certainly upped our food prep game. Used it about once a week thus far and enjoyed the heck out of it. 

My iPad continues to be my favorite device I’ve ever owned. My watch is up there, too.

My most recent waterbottle acquisition continues to bring me joy as well as hydration[^1].

[^1]: This is one of those sentence that will make me cringe in 5 years. It actually accomplished that task 5 years ahead of schedule.

# Ideas 💡

Ideas are what have consumed my brain for the past many weeks. My reading and notetaking have increased substantially. I go in waves with it. I’ll read a bunch, then stagnate somewhat. Right now I’m in “backlog of books” mode. See the Top 5. I’ve made 77 new notes this year. We’ve not yet reached Valentine’s Day. Over the past 1428 days I’ve created 1505 notes. That’s 1.05 notes added to the cache per day. Huh.

AI is crazy. I started using ChatGPT and ~~bard~~ Gemini more recently. It's astounding how helpful it is. It's also still one of the scariest things, too. All articulations of "humans vs AI" in movies I've ever seen woefully under-represent what the AI would be like. Ultron should have **destroyed** the Avengers.

My Podcast has made a comeback! It's about movies. Click the image below:

<a href="https://shows.acast.com/we-scene-a-movie"><img src="/assets/448-1.png" alt="cover"/></a>

Here’s another idea: a hoodie with abs sown into the front so you can look ripped **and** cozy. MAKE IT HAPPEN, FASHION.



# Top 5: Backlog of Books



## 5. What If? 2

I love & own [Randall Munroe’s other books](https://xkcd.com/books/). Looking forward to this one.



## 4. The Things We Make

A book about invention.



## 3. Leadership and Self-Deception

Thanks for the recommendation, Jonboy.



## 2. The Extended Mind

I just started this. I went in expecting this to be simply about GTD and Notetaking. It looks like it’s about more than that, which I’m happy about.



## 1. Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy

I actually just finished this.

# Motto: The Column: Delayed.

This column has been half written for several hours days. I've been experimenting with various methods to make music using only my computer and zero dollars. So far, I've created nothing worthwhile. Check back in several hours when I am done and have still created nothing worthwhile something hilariously terrible!

I just recently realized how easily it is to manage your installed applications on Google's web-based Play Store. There are two tabs under "My Android Apps", one with a picture of my phone, the other a picture of my tablet. These tabs show what is currently on each device, what has been on each device, and allows you to add or remove whatever apps you want without even touching either. I might do this more.

I will forever add two extra steps to any plan I do thanks to an episode of South Park I saw a long time ago. Warning: That link takes you to tvtropes.org, be prepared to waste several hours upon entering.

----- the column up to this point and the red portion of the Top 5 were written a few days ago, but never finished -----

I made a song using my computer, [a really awesome website](http://www.noteflight.com/), and my video camera. It took me way longer than it should have. It ended up being way worse than even I expected. Rather than put it on the internet to suck for everyone, I think I'll just post the sheet music that I made.

![](assets/30-1.jpg)


I have in front of me a lease for an apartment in downtown Kansas City. I'm pretty excited about the coming few days. I would be willing to bet my next column won't take place until after I've moved in. So, look forward to that, I guess.

I have been fighting a summertime cold since I first started this column. Maybe when I post it the cold will instantly leave me. Maybe it's a column-associated illness. Those exist, right?

A quick list of things Apple added that weren't already in Android phones:
- Apple's A6 chip
- Backside illuminated sensor on the camera
- Quartz crystal (which is apparently a good thing?)
- A couple Siri improvements (I'm not sure what all is actually new, though)
- ???
- Profit!

A quick list of things Apple added that helps them catch up to Android phones:
- A screen >3.5"
- LTE and HSPA+ (4G)
- Sending an SMS when ignoring a call
- Native panorama support
- A connector that isn't bigger than the other end of the USB cable
- Navigation in maps and 3D modeled aerial imagery
- You can ask your phone about sports scores
- The ability to take pictures as you are taking a video

All those iPod/iPhone accessories you have now, anything using the old connector, will STILL WORK FOLKS! Don't worry! They have this really neato docking adapter! I'm sure the new smaller connector will be able to hold the weight of your phone sitting on the connector, sitting on your accessories! I'm sure there won't be any issues at all with that or the balancing or the newly added ~2 inches on top of the phone (estimated looking at the adapter).

When will the hoards of Apple fanatics begin to realize the innovative and amazing company they once fell in love with is playing a game of catch-up with the competitors that have since surpassed them?

Ugh.

I'm going to leave this off with pictures of some hot air balloons that Melissa and I stumbled into with the help of my big sister:

![](assets/30-2.jpg)

Rock Chalk buoyancy due to localized displacement of normal air density!
![](assets/30-3.jpg)

I thought this was a cool shot.

There were ~30 balloons I believe...


# Top 5: Predictions for the iPhone 5 - And how they turned out.
5. The screen will be (basically) 4 inches diagonally and have a 16:9 aspect ratio. Apple will simultaneously talk about revolutionary and new this is while making cheap jokes about the phone not being a surfboard like 5 inch Android phones. I intentionally stated these two things because they are stupid and contradict each other... and I really want to say I called it. The iPhone 5 will have a 16:9 4 inch display. They didn't say it was revolutionary, but the DID explain why it is such a good thing for 15 minutes. You can see more content at once!
4. The back of the phone won't be glass anymore. Thus you won't be able to shatter the back of your phone. I nailed it (read: I read the rumors and this one panned out)
3. The iPhone connector that we have all come to know and love (hate) will be no more. The new, smaller, connector will become standard. Apple will spin it off as being more advanced or otherwise better to trick people into thinking there is some reason they chose it over a microUSB port when in actuality they are just trying to keep their customers on Apple Island as much as possible. A microUSB port would be just too much like those other phones. The new "Lightning" connector wasn't talked a whole lot about. They didn't say it was capable of doing anything in particular that was too fancy. It IS bi-directional, though. That's pretty spiffy.
2. 4G. When I say 4G I am referring to Long Term Evolution (LTE) 4G. It will be included. Apple will address the battery life concerns with some argument that may or may not actually pan out/be logical. After its release, Apple will get sued by HTC and probably others. I will laugh and laugh.Apple DID include LTE and immediately address the battery life concerns right after. They didn't specify how their battery life would be "even better than the iPhone 4S", so their argument didn't really exist.
1. There will be no near field communication. This prediction I sincerely hope I'm wrong about, as I would love to see NFC become a mainstay, and Apple has the hoards of followers to make that happen... but they will probably exclude it, if for no other reason just to make me really angry. Bingo! Nailed it! Apple has singlehandedly set back the eventual standard for mobile payment (which will, eventually be more standard in and of itself) a year by not including it! None of the other cool tricks for NFC can be incorporated now, either. This is the worst part.

This is a follow-on to [Column 370](https://aarongilly.com/370), a Column which turned out to be perfectly mistimed. I end that post making mention of my discovery of "Notion", which went on to supplant almost everything I had just written about. More than that, though, it's all gone from *"a thing I like in theory"* to **"a thing I actively do and use"**.

# Organization Theory

Organization is about minimizing friction between you and the thing you need when you need it. Whether that thing be a physical item, event or task to attend to, or a note/piece of reference material, you don't want to have to dig and search, or worse - lose it altogether.

When it comes to organizing yourself, you can start with the *techniques* you like and work your way backwards to how to apply those techniques to your life, or you can start with the things you care about organizing (your scope) and then look for techniques to that might apply to them. I think it's best to do a mix of the two approaches in an iterative fashion. Organization, like fashion, is never "finished". This post will assuredly age poorly as I "see the light" again in the future.

How you organize our physical space is dependent on the things you own and the space available to you; as such it isn't THAT transferable (or interesting) for me to talk about the layout of our kitchen[^1]. If you're interested in physical organization, [here's a place to start](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/1756597)[^2] This post will focus on how I organize my time and information.

## Scope

I've spent literally **years** thinking about/obsessing over the best way to organize things in my life. These are things I am going to cover in this post.

- Events
- Tasks & Projects
- Notes

## Tools & Techniques

My toolbox has grown, then shrank over the years. **Perfection, they say, is not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away.** I believe I have approached that point for managing my needs.

This is what's in my current toolbox:

- Google Calendar + Gmail
- iOS Reminders
- Notion

More important than the tools, are the techniques:

- Consistent Lists
- Periodic Reviews
- Connected systems

# Tools

## Events

Nothing revolutionary here.  I use **Google Calendar**[^3] to manage event-planning. It's cloud-based therefore always in sync. I have a personal one and a shared one with my wife. It's used for appointments and contains the logistics for those appointments. I make good use of the "Notifications" feature to ensure something pops up on my phone if I need to be getting out the door or on the phone soon. On the whole, though, my calendar is usually pretty blank.

## Tasks and Projects

### Background

How I manage tasks and projects is an area of that has seen a **lot** of turn in the past 18 months. I've used for some time Google Tasks, Google Keep, Wunderlist, Todoist, a master Notion "tasks" database, and most recently the built-in iOS Reminders app. My philosophy on "Getting Things Done" changed as I gained real-world first-hand experience with it (as opposed to reading other people's ideas ). Ultimately all you can do is try a lot of things, keep what works, and throw away what doesn't. I've thrown away a *lot* of things. 

### Rise and Fall of Todoist

I used **Todoist** extensively for about 16 months with great success. Much like Google Calendar, my wife and I each had our own Todoist lists, and we had a shared list as well. That worked honestly quite well. We created tasks to remind ourselves to do things. We would plan out our days using tasks in a shared list. We would sometimes even use tasks as a way to ask each other to "take care of (whatever)".

Ultimately, though I never found Todoist to be that good for **Projects**. If your tasks were sufficiently large, they became difficult to manage. I found that most of my Project scope usually contained some information that was useful for completing the project (i.e. project notes). Todoist's solution for that sort of thing is to use comments, which is clearly a workaround at best. Also Todoist Projects, once complete, sort of just disappear. I could never quickly find reference info from the Projects I completed in the past, which was something I often wanted. 

So I found something else for managing projects. Then I took a step back and looked at what I was actually using Todoist for... and I realized that every single one of those things could also be done on the built-in "Reminders" application on iOS. So we've been giving that a go for a few months now and it's been great.

### Notion + iOS Reminders

I use **Notion** to manage my personal projects. I have a "Project List" in Notion which houses pages containing project scope definition, notes, and associated tasks to complete. Some quick examples: 

- Just today I created a page to manage my trial on Mint Mobile
- I have a project for the next Podcast Episode I'm about to record
- I have a project page for researching a potential vehicle purchase
- This text is literally being typed on my phone in a Notion page titled "#401 - Revisiting AIM"

With iOS 13, the built-in Reminders app got much more capable.
I use **iOS reminders** to handle different scenarios: 

- iOS Reminders is my primary "inbox" for ideas, quotes, & tasks
- I maintain a list containing any task with a due date or some sort of location-binding, (even those in Notion Projects are added in Reminders, too)
- I maintain a list containing vague ideas I may (or may not) do in the future
- My wife and I maintain a shared family list for those things we do to manage the house & family

## Notes

A little over a year ago I learned about the concept of a "[Zettelkasten]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)". For those of you who aren't completely insane and don't care to read in great depth about personal knowledge management solutions & notetaking techniques - it's basically this:

- Create a massive collection of notes in a single place
- Every note should contain at most one basic idea
- Every note should be linked to some other note in the collection
- If you like, you can tag your notes with tags according to their nature

That's about it. 

If the concept seems vaguely familiar, it's because [I wrote about it 7 months ago]([https://aarongilly.com/390](https://aarongilly.com/390). That Column explains what I do and how I do it better than I care to right here. It's all managed in **Notion**. For more, click that link - or just [go see my notes](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea?v=c957bb0ea6dd42e9a83df8338e11c786) and their [sources](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/e301531cc1ee4ad7ae537d87f9681116?v=2136c19212174a24956154a130b78b1b)!

Since I wrote that post, Notion implemented a "backlink" feature which automatically creates a list of pages in Notion that link to whatever page you're on. It makes my whole thing both more effective and incredibly easy to manage. Basically it's all automatic now. Also since writing that post, I went from 270 notes, to rapidly approaching 500. After I finish reading the book I'm reading now I'm sure it will be at 500+.

# Techniques

Organization requires some level of consistency. You need **something** that you can consistently rely on to be the framework around which the rest of any organization/productivity system may be built. 

You don't need fancy tools if you've got the right techniques. For example, one of the best organizational/productivity techniques is "inbox zero". Realistically, it doesn't matter if your "inbox" is some *application*, or *a physical inbox*, or your *email*, or the result of some *combination of automations*... it could be literally set of text files on your desktop. It could be sticky notes you stuck to the wall of your office. It doesn't matter what or where you capture ideas and tasks, so long as it's a consistent spot and you make time to process them all. That's what's valuable.

My tools reflect my techniques. To mix up the pages of text, I'm going to leave the rest of this column to be done visually.

## iOS Reminders Lists

## The Ongoing Process

![ongoing process](assets/401-3.jpg)

## Review Cycles

![Review cycles](assets/401-4.jpg)

One final note worth mentioning: Clearly I do a lot more than just those things. What you're reading is a tool I use to help me sort out my thoughts. I have a 30 Day Challenge database in Notion. I have a [Creation of the Week](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b?v=6d08d1c56ba24e97b75a60fc5dba073c) database. I built an entire home-grown MongoDB-based webapp to use as a quantified self journal. This Column is the core stuff that I think would apply to you, dear reader.

Also: hi Whitney, hi Emily. I didn't know you read.

# Top 5: Tips for Organizing Yourself

## 5. Use a Calendar

Calendars are free. The most basic thing you can do to organize yourself is have something that marks the passage of time that you can make notes on.

## 4. Keep a List of Your Goals & Projects

It's good to have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, and what things you're actively working on. In an ideal world, those things should be connected.

## 3. Have an Inbox

You need a consistent place where you will capture ideas, tasks, or whatever comes across your plate.

## 2. Do a Weekly Review Every Week

You need to make time to step back from what's immediately in front of you and look at what you've done, what's left to do, what's on your radar, and ensure everything is well-aligned.

## 1. Get to Inbox Zero Every Day

The cornerstone of being on top of things is having a consistent place to capture things coming into your life, and consistently processing all those captured things. My wife and I both are huge proponents of Inbox Zero. We both hit it every single day.

> Hi Goose!
<cite>My Older Son, to an Alpaca at the zoo</cite>

[^1]: Our house is very organized. This is 95% thanks to my wife, 20% thanks to me, and -25% thanks to our 2 year old.

[^2]: TL;DR - get rid of everything you own and you've nothing left to organize!

[^3]: Google Calendar is our default, but that only is because it's what is connected to our gmail accounts. For as much as I have been moving away from Google lately, dumping gmail just isn't in the cards. That's locked in.

[^4]: You could probably live with just the built-in Apple quartet of productivity apps (Reminders + Notes + Mail + Calendar) and live a reasonably well-organized, low-friction life. Although I've tried all of those applications, the only one I've stuck with in my workflow is the Reminders app. Maybe someday I'll do an ambitions "vanilla Apple applications *only* 30 Day Challenge and write about it. Who knows.

# Motto: Throwing Everything Possibly Deep at a Wall to See What Sticks

This weekend was dedicated to me. Aaron took a weekend for Aaron - probably undeservedly so. I need to be doing things for other people, being selfless to use say something selfish and play it off like it's rare. I took a weekend to do exactly what I wanted to do, and it was great. But that happens most weekends lately. 

This weekend I finished my second videogame since Melissa left. That puts me at one game every 10 days or so. Considering each game is supposed to take ~12 hours to beat, that's, what, 1 hour 12 minutes a night?

I guess that's not as bad as I thought.

Uncharted 2 is the best game I've ever played, by the way. I know nobody who reads this cares, but I wanted to take that one sentence to say something about the 12 hours I spent over the past week or so.

I sat down today to do something I don't do much anymore. I sat down with a pen and a few pieces of paper in front of me to do some drawing or writing or whatever. I used to do this a lot (usually when I should have been paying attention in physics or something, but that's beside the point). Not a lot came out of it. In fact, nothing good at all. I forgot that the majority of my doodles and scribbles in class were terrible. The good ones were the exception to the rule; and not the other way around. I just sat there staring at a blank piece of paper for a really long time. It was way harder than starting a column. I don't think I've ever sat and stared at a blank screen, wondering what should go on it. 

Maybe I am scared of me judging my creativity moreso than others. Maybe there's something deep there. 

I don't create things for myself because I can't settle for anything less than genius. Every line has to be saturated with poetic meaning and deep metaphor. Every eye I draw has to look so much like an eye that it makes you too creeped out to keep the thing in your bathroom. 

I'm afraid most of this isn't making sense.

Before you get all accusatory, there was only one other person in there.
This was on the way up to my seat. My old phone couldn't have done this.
If you know me really well, you know I don't think the same as I normally do right when I get out of a movie. I think in much simpler terms. The complexities of the world don't concern me because they don't exist. Life makes perfect sense - and it is great. This feeling is the reason I went to film school to begin with. I didn't like it. Classes didn't bring me to this zen. I didn't like the prospect of making something I wasn't emotionally motivated by. Making films for money. No thank you.

I'll make electronics.

Anyway.

I just watched "Silver Linings Playbook". It was good.

In related news:

I like movies. I like my friends. I like my life.

# Top 5: Parts of the "Routine" that have been giving me the most trouble
5. Learning to cook new things (I've only made one new thing that I can think of)
4. There isn't anything to put here. It was the last one, and I'm out of things. I'll take this time to say that this week passed last week as the most productive week so far on the Demetri List. Continued success?
3. Apparently getting groceries on Sunday, I forgot to tonight
2. Waking up in time to work out (it's not the working out, it's the waking up)
1. Going to bed at the right time

Motto: I can count... allllll the way... to schfifty five.

To start this column off, I'm going to link to an old internet favorite. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XccUMOQ978) is every bit as stupid as "End of Ze World", and was watched an equally shameful number of times by me in my internet-going youth. It is relevant only to this column, so it basically had to be posted now. It is 95% safe for work.

This is likely the last post I will have for the year. So, I will use it to bid adieu to 2012. I think 2012 was the greatest year of my life. Allow me to do a quick recap, outline style:

I finished out the second semester as the RA of the greatest floor ever.
3rd Floor Templin > all other floors in history
I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas. 
I managed to hit the GPA I wanted and worked for the last two years of college.
Future schooling remains to be seen...
I lived someplace OTHER than the dorms and my parent's house:
For a couple of months I got the chance to have Josh as my roommate and live in Lawrence.
I moved by myself to Downtown Kansas City; and I love it here and I love living by myself.
I had an extended vacation...
For several months, my only job was "looking for a job". This is strikingly similar to "vacation" when you know that you should be able to find something and aren't worried about it.
I got my first real job - and it is going great (in a not-sarcastic way, too!)
Related: I got on my own insurance.
Related: I got on my own phone plan.
I hit a couple of milestones...
I, for the first time, own my own furniture
My current relationship became my longest ever... and it's stronger than ever
I developed a new and improved Demetri List, and have been running it longer than any previous attempts
I got stuck in an elevator (I always wanted this to happen once in my life... now that it's done, never again)
I won $60 on a slot machine, walked away with all of it.
I got to play for the intramural basketball championship in Allen Fieldhouse
I got into a physical shape that I could be a tiny bit proud of... (still working to improve, though)
I kept my 2012 new year's resolution - "take more photos"
2011 - 199 pictures and videos
2012 - 1943 pictures and videos (if I get 47 more in the next 4 days, I will have increased my shutterbugivity tenfold)
I was the top post on all of Reddit for several hours
A.K.A. - I was king of the internet for several hours
I went on a few trips...
I went to Colorado with several of my residents from T3 and learned how to snowboard
Also got super sick and thought I was going to die... but that's a funny story now
Melissa and I visited Austin, TX and genuinely loved it there. Could easily see myself living there.
I visited my girlfriend at her job as a camp director at a summer camp in Indiana for children with special needs
I went to California and made my first lasting memories of the state. I saw Hollywood, Los Angeles, San Francisco, wine country, and the GOOGLEPLEX.
I started my most ambitious video project ever, and it's going really well
At the first of the year, I'll upload the first 4 months of it to YouTube (next post, prolly)
I met many new people and made several new friendships - friendships that have grown and developed much further than I thought possible one year ago
I have been doing a semi-decent job of visiting friends for a change!
I organized and procured an excellent EDC bag that has worked out better even than I expected it to
I got a (new) Nexus phone and a Nexus tablet... and couldn't be happier with them
Kansas City Irishfest
The Avengers finally came out... and fter years of anticipation, it didn't disappoint
I watched Amy's volleyball team trounce everyone they played
I watched my girlfriend succeed with her first two classrooms during her stent as a student teacher
Both my sisters got married and have started their "happily ever after"(s)
I re-started The Column, and have found myself enjoying it more and more as time goes on
And many, many more memories that I didn't even list here
Best year ever.

Here is an album of my favorite 50 photos from the past 361 days. It loads pretty quick and doesn't require you to sign into anything to view. I considered posting all 50 of these photos in-line, so consider yourselves lucky.

# Top 5: Google-related Chrome Extensions
5. Google Calendar - Access your upcoming events and add new ones without opening a calendar window
4. Google Tasks - Same thing, except with tasks... I use this extensively
3. Google Voice - If you have a Google Voice # (and probably if you don't), this is a very handy. Send texts, call, and check voicemail quickly and easily
2. Google Plus One Button - Share any webpage on Google+ instantly and easily - really the easiest way to share something on the web
1. Better Music for Google Play Music - See what's playing and all the basic music controls, without opening the Music tab.

**Motto: why not do a throwback?**

At some point I accidentally started all my Columns with writing about my Columns. I've always hated that. Here I am doing it again.

# 10 Years Tracked

Today, 4/22/2023, marks the 10th anniversary of the first day I successfully started adding to my horribly named, horribly re-renamed, and continues to be horribly named life-tracking project. Today's post was supposed to be a celebration of my having successfully re-built the project from scratch as part of my transition to version 10[^1], which consolidates 10 years of data distributed across different databases and platforms into a new, more forward-looking future-proof version. I'll write way more than you care to hear about it someday.

Alas I don't have that ready. I missed the deadline I set for myself. Not due to lack of trying. I have done zen-master levels of coding for the past few days. One of those sessions I'll probably never forget. You can **really** make 10 hours go by quickly when you're locked in. I did that a couple of times back-to-back.

Turns out it's just a really big task. 

![image of a cake](assets/435-1.jpg)



# Top 5: Other Things "Coming Soon" to the Column



## 5. Humor

I dove through some of my back catalog of Columns. There are some real clunkers in there. From meaningless drivel to surface-level takes on what I thought were semi-intellectual topics back in the day, not great. But there are also **some good jokes** in there. I used to try to be funnier on here than I have been lately. Feels really good to re-discover something you wrote that you still think is funny. 

Maybe I'll start putting humor in here again.



## 4. Some Formatting Fixes for Old Posts

A year back or so I went through Columns [1](/1) through [120](/120) and cleaned up the formatting. Sometime I'll find a good show to watch and finish the remaining 255 Columns that are so much less 'clean' from an admin/organization perspective. The link for [Column 120](/120) is literally just '/120'. But, as of right now, that doesn't work for 121 through 375. Plus all sorts of other things are wrong with them. 

This will also include a very slightly improved [tag](/tags/) scheme. Did you know these posts are tagged? Yeah, they aren't useful.



## 3. The Panethon of Good Columns

As part of the great formatting fix, I was re-reading pretty much everything. Decided to make note of some Columns that were actually good. I'll post a "best of" list at some point. 



## 2. Some [Gillespedia](/gillespedia) Articles

I said I wasn't going to do Gillespedia articles any more... but I've stumbled across more topics I want to use "writing an article" as an excuse to learn about.



## 1. Good Vibes & Shorter Posts

Life's been going pretty well lately. I'm optimistic.

How wise is doing your own therapy by writing and putting it online?
# System Building & Problem Solving
I build systems to solve problems. It's what I have done for as long as I can remember. 

When I learn about a problem I can't help but think through ways to tackle it. I think about the variables in play, the joints and how they pivot, the factors that cause it and how they could be influenced, look at the downstream effects of hypothetical changes and ask myself what 2nd & 3rd order effects might be. 

But what if the *system building **is** the problem?*

The **real** problem is that *problems exist*, and always will exist, and are a completely unavoidable fact of life. Not all problems are solvable. Worst of all, it's in our nature as humans to grow dissatisfied with whatever solutions you do come up with. 

I build a system to manage my tasks. I decide that system should have deadlines. It should handle project notes. I move the system to a new platform and tweak it. I tweak the tweaks. The whole thing works flawlessly. 

But after a while I find myself simply *not* using it. I figure the issue is something inherent to the system design. I migrate tools and start from scratch. I build goals and tasks and projects that all interconnect. I introduce templates and work the system to a well-honed, perfectly balanced, harmonious coalescence of congruent parts - each dovetailing perfectly into the other. The system stabilizes. It hums. 

But then time passes, and it turns out still life is *hard*. I forget things or feel overwhelmed. I ask myself "why am I having this type of problem when I have spent so much energy working the system to handle these sorts of things? Could I rethink or reengineer the system to make this easier?". I do something new or different or start from scratch again.

So the system keeps evolving and resetting. There's a lack of continuity and consistency, which is totally antithetical to good design principles and my general ethos.

> [!important] **The real problem is there is no system that makes life easy.**

Looking at things from a broader perspective, I have incurred so much *overhead cost* in trying to find things that take the *overhead cost* out of life. You take 3 steps forward. Then find out you've already been here before. 

![[464-1.png]]

But this is also *who I am*. It is what I do for myself, at my job, and for those I love. I enjoy doing it. I *like* that it is who I am. It (can) add value to life. I took a break from designing a system to write this. I am excited to write about *that* system after the holidays are over[^1]. 
# A Coding Metaphor for Non-coders 
This metaphor is a bit of a stretch, but I think it's at least somewhat valid.

Coding is like organizing your house. You set up bookshelves and end tables and stuff, and everything is hunky dory. Then you slowly accumulate new things and start just finding places to put them. Every once in a while, you have to stop and work on the overall feng shui of what *used* to work. You need to spend time working on new shelving units, even if that means tearing down the old ones.

You can prevent *some* of this by planning in advance how you're going to handle things, but you can't forsee everything.

You balance "finding a place to stick this thing you need" with "redoing what you've already done so that the thing you need has a place that makes sense (and, ideally, replaces several other things)".
# Top ~~5~~ 8: Systems that Work
The common theme in this is what coding folks call "[Conceptual Integrity](https://gillespedia.com/Conceptual+Integrity)" - each of these things handles **one** thing, and handles it well. This didn't start out as a list of productivity things, but it did sort of end up that way.
## 8. Use a Daily Post-It
Have a physical piece of paper, doesn't have to be a post it, but does have to be *small*. Write down those few things you need to find time to do today, the things you need to remember. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Daily+Post+It).
## 7. Put it Where You Need It
Any time you can, take advantage of *space*. If you know your kid needs to wear a particular outfit for school tomorrow, set that outfit out. Put it directly in the way of where you'd need to go to get something else. Leave things that need dealt with *out* - and **deal with it** when you leave it out. Don't let "things you want to get to *someday*" get in the way of *things you need to do as soon as you can*. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Contextual+Reminders).
## 6. Checklists
The humble checklist, especially a checklist you made yourself & located to surface when it is relevant, is just a darn good way of doing things. A simple "do this and this and this" ensures consistency, frees up mental space, and can jumpstart your progress. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Checklists).

Also, [templates are checklists](https://gillespedia.com/Other+Forms+of+Checklist#Templates).  
## 5. A Scheduled Weekly Review
The Weekly Review is probably the single most frequently suggested "productivity habit" you'll find recommended by people who recommend those kinds of things. Having a weekly ritual to check your bases and think about the week ahead is a no-brainer. Schedule it to block time for it. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Weekly+Review).

Also, [block your time](https://gillespedia.com/Time+Blocking).
## 4. Having an Inbox
An inbox is a default place for things to go that you need to deal with. If you don't have an inbox, things you need to deal with end up going *wherever*, which means you won't necessarily deal with them. For an inbox to be *useful*, you need to **use it**. Seems obvious, but the point is that you need to consistently empty it out to make it the functional. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Inbox).
## 3. Habit Trackers
I'll continue to credit the Streaks app for having the biggest impact on my day-to-day life. Of course there's nothing special about *streaks* in general - any sort of daily checklist for things you'd like to (or need to) do each day. See [my note on this](https://gillespedia.com/Habit+Tracking).
## 2.  Reminders & Alarms
Your phone is your friend. Use it. All the time.
## 1. Siri Shortcuts as a Capture Mechanism
The built-in Siri Shortcuts workflow management is super capable, and you can super power it with apps like [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1085978097) and [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1085978097) to allow you to run regular old code. Honestly this section of this already way-too-long Column deserves its own page. Or its own dedicated *entire blog*[^2].

Motto: Watch What I'm About to Do Here

  
Predicting the future of technology has been a staple of science fiction. I'm running short on time, so I'll keep this list short.  
* 2001: A Space Odyssey predicted the moon landing, space stations, video calls, and the iPad. It also predicted stasis & artificial intelligence that was capable of feeling love.
* Iron Man showed us what a truly intelligent AI companion might be like. In addition, repulsor technology, and whatever the arc reactor is.
* Minority Report showed us that a User Interface can be a beautiful thing. Also - self driving cars. Also, weird clairvoyant slime twins.
* GATTACCA & A Brave New World tell us that genetics aren't a thing to be inherited, they are a thing to be created.
* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy suggested that we would someday be able to carry around a book that contained all the information we would ever need to know.
Oh, and -  
  
Dick Tracy, the Jetsons, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Knight Rider, Inspector Gadget, Predator, Star Trek, James Bond, Spy Kids, Futurama, and countless others all predicted that we'd have watches that are capable of much more than just telling the time.   
  
I believe we are about to see the dawn of the first truly _good_ smartwatch. As is the case with many things, it will be thanks to Google:  
  
  
That's the developer focused video. I didn't share the [consumer-centric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrqZl2QIz0c) because I thought it was too flashy, too niche, too kitsch, and not at all my style.  
  
[Android Wear](http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html): putting something on your wrist that makes sense. Based off the what I've seen and read, Google is nailing it in terms of what _should actually be in a watch_. Samsung tried the smartwatch thing. It has a camera on the strap. That's idiotic. Full stop.  
  
Quick, contextual, actionable notifications will be the killer app of the coming wave of smartwatches. Secondly, fitness and "the quantified self" (something I know too much about) will also play a big part.  
  
Imagine not having to take your phone out of your pocket to see who texted you.  
Imagine being able to ask Google a question without the 8 second barrier to entry.  
Imagine your watch telling you not only what time it is now, but what time you need to leave to make it to your doctor's appointment.  
Imagine what else we can do with this.  
  
It's coming. It's not science fiction. It's science fact.  
  
Here's my response to all of the above:  

  
[![](assets/159-1.gif)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n9GkNVKqZBQ/UzhiWwHSkQI/AAAAAAABLAU/iIyCs4FNYzE/s1600/shut-up-and-take-my-money.gif)

Top 5: Other Technologies We are Still Waiting For

5\. A direct neural interface. Having things literally beamed straight into your mind.  
4\. A single, cheap food that alone provides all the nutrients that humans need to survive. This was promised to us in the Matrix, Futurama, and a couple other places.   
3\. Teleportation. Beam me to work, Scotty. Now beam me to the store. Now beam me to the hospital to get treated for teleportation cancer (that's a Family Guy reference).  
2\. Flying cars. We have cars. We have things that can fly. What's the hold up?  
1\. Super powers. Come on, man. I want one while I'm still young enough to enjoy it.

# Intentional Living

Intentional living is an incredibly gratifying way to go about your day-to-day. It raises both the ceiling and the floor of each day's potential. Living with intent is all about knowing who you are, what you want, where you want to be, and the *why* behind it all. Mapping your actions and desires back to an overall plan puts them in context. It makes decision-making easier. It makes going to the gym easier. It makes studying easier. You're not just "cleaning a toilet", you're giving your family a safe and sanitary place to live. You're not just "mowing a lawn", you're contributing to the image of the neighborhood, raising everyone's property value, and keeping on top of your responsibilities to have a clear head.

Life invariably has its ups and downs. There's nothing you can do to prevent that; it's the human condition. Not having a grand, overarching plan isn't something you notice on good days. "What's the meaning of it all" doesn't seem to matter as much when you fall asleep easy, wake up refreshed, feel physically capable, and have the mental acuity of Jason Bourne on 2 liters of Red Bull.

Unfortunately, that's not everyday. There are days on the *other* end of the spectrum. Life doesn't have to suck outright even when sleep isn't coming, your back hurts, the place is a mess, your car needs work, and you're feeling generally uninspired. Those days can be made massively more tolerable (or, dare I say, *satisfying*), if you understand the **why** behind everything you're doing. You aren't sleeping because you stared at a screen until 11pm, because you procrastinated on work that is due, because you weren't sure how to do it, because you didn't get clarification when you had the chance, because you were scared asking "what do you mean?" would make you seem slow or unintuitive to your boss, professor, teacher, spouse, friend, or peer. Once you've ridden the Why-Chain down enough levels, you will find something inside your circle of influence. Or, if you don't find root cause about which you can affect some form of change, you might just realize your back hurts because you helped a friend move, *because maintaining that kind of friendship is important*. Your back pain isn't pointless suffering.

Over the past ~year or so I've been reading a lot of nonfiction books in the realm of business, personal development, and productivity. I've been studying computer science. I've been learning about and utilizing process modeling techniques and improvement tools.  Adding this to three decades of just trying to figure out how things work and how to make them better, and it became clear to me. There's a common, core set of principles that come up again and again. These few through-lines of organization, achievement, and self-actualization are pervasive. I believe they can be woven together and turned into a simple-yet-extensible system of intentional living. This is a topic I've been writing a *lot* about... just not on here.

# Manifest

I've been working on one technique to cultivate a more intentional life:  
A manifest.  
A short list of lists.  
A master registry of what's important to me and how I'm managing it.

I am building a centralized, tool-agnostic manifest. Something to look at when I don't know what I should be doing with my time, or don't feel like doing whatever seemingly-arbitrary task is in front of me, a visible artifact against which I could apply the Pareto principle to "get more" out of life, or better-align priorities with their corresponding efforts, a visualization of my personal productivity stack, an enduring technique to ride the ebbs and flows of whatever tools and methods are available. It lives in [Notion](http://notion.so), but it could just as easily live in Excel, a bookmarks folder, a Google Doc, a notepad plaintext file, or just piece of paper on my desk.

By design the manifest doesn't have much content. It is a set of links to tools and/or important documents. The locations pointed to are to be updated as life changes, what you use changes, and what is important comes and goes. My manifest is 6 items long. 

## A Timeline

My system starts with a 5 Year Plan. Like most good project plans, it is broken into various levels of granularity by temporal proximity. In non-thesaurus speak, it's more specific for the next few months, and increasingly vague as you go into the future. 

![[388-2.png]]

My timeline is mostly (although not exclusively) my list of **goals**, plotted on a common axis. It's housed in Notion.

## A Task & Appointments Manager

I'm cheating here by calling this one thing. It is links my logistics management combo of Todoist + Google Calendar.

## A Projects List

My list of on-going Projects. Things I'm doing to achieve some sort of end. My Projects List is housed in Notion. Notion is a recurring theme here. Some day I'll write about Notion again more explicitly. My thoughts have evolved since [when I first talked about it on here](https://aarongilly.com/371).

## An Areas List

A list of different aspects of my life that I care about. These are the things I'm responsible for maintaining or want to be better at. The purpose of the Areas List is to ensure you've got your bases covered, and to ensure the irons you have in the fire actually deserve your time and energy.

I'm a huge fan of maps. I could (and likely will at some point) write all about that.

![[388-1.png]]

A goal without an associated Project (like G4 from the graphic above) is a wish. A project without an associated goal (like P4) is something you're doing just for fun. An area without an associated project or goal is on cruise control. If too many of your goals are associated with any one area, you may reconsider what's important to you. If one Project supports many goals and/or many areas (P2), it might warrant extra attention and maintenance. Creating a map like this allows you to see and realize what you're spending your time and energy doing. If you find yourself working tirelessly toward something that you can't map cleanly back to a given goal or area that you care about... then why are you doing it?

## A Personal Logbook

This is a link to my Data Journal and it's associated data manifest. I assume not everyone would want one of these, but I believe everyone would benefit from such an exercise. It doesn't need to be a robust quantified self system. It could be as simple as a list of "this is where I put my tax returns" and things such as that. It's housed in Google Sheets. 

## A Notetaking System

This is a link to my personal knowledge management solution. Whereas the personal logbook is a list of discrete time-bound facts, the notetaking system comprises of open-ended general knowledge-type information. Again I would like to write more about this topic, but I've already written too much. In short, [Gillespedia](http://gillespedia.com) is likely going to be moved into this blog as I set up my [Zettelkasten](https://www.google.com/search?q=zettelkasten).

# Motto: a Day Late and Still Free


Today is Wednesday. Most of this column was written yesterday, but I wasn't able to post it yesterday. I'm still going to try to do the whole Sunday/Wednesday thing, but I guess this may happen from time to time. No big deal.

I wanted to show pictures I've taken of every car I've owned - that was my plan. When I set off to find pictures of these cars on my computer I thought to myself "I might not have any pictures of my oldest car." If my plan was going to fail, that's where it would have gone wrong. 

Turns out I didn't have pictures of *any* of my three previous vehicles. That's how much I car about cars. 

So, utilizing Google, here's a brief visual tour of my automotive history:

2002-2003: The "Weezer Wagon". A hand-me-down from my sisters. Had a big Weezer logo in the back windshield.

![mk1](assets/108-1.jpg)

2003-2007: The "Man Car". My dad had a policy of buying each of his kids one car. If you messed it up, it was on you. It got called a "girl's car" so many times I decided to make a license plate out of duct tape and electrical tape that said "Man Car".

![mk2](assets/108-2.jpg)

2007-2013: The "My Mom's Car". This was another hand-me-down. Although I drove it for a longer period of time than she did, it never really stopped being "her car" in my mind.

![mk3](assets/108-3.jpg)

2013-???: The "Mark 4". This is the first car I've ever paid for on my own accord. The first time I've had my own insurance. It's the 4th car I've ever owned and it kind of reminded me of the Iron Man aesthetic.

![mk4](assets/108-4.jpg)

Sorry for using essentially the same photo as last time. I do have more, but I wanted to stick with the same camera angle as the other three pictures. That happened by accident, by the way. I guess it must be my favorite vehicle angle.

I've been life tracking for exactly 4 months. Well, sort of. I took July off. I have 12 1/2 week's data. Enough to establish an average. 

Thus, I present to you what an average day in my diet looks like:

![grid 1](assets/108-5.png)

Because raw numbers are hard to visualize, here's what I ate on the day that most closely resembles my average numbers:

![grid](assets/108-6.png)

That's an average-ish day.

Here's a short story:
I used to work security at the dormitory I lived in back in college. The facility had a strict "no pets" policy, but that didn't stop everyone. One night, during one of my desk shifts, a freshman girl tried to sneak a kitten in the building in her backpack. She was holding her backpack in front of her, all tucked up close like she thought someone was going to steal it. It made me notice her. Then I heard a faint "mew". She went wide-eyed for a second before looking at me. I said "what have you got there?" Then she let the cat out of the bag.

That's a dumb joke I thought up yesterday.

I am going to end the column off by saying I WANT TO DO THIS:

Motto: Upon this rock, I will build my church.  
  
If the motto is sacrilegious, I apologize. I'm not referencing Matthew 16:18, I'm referencing [Ultron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pY4cimqaKQ). Ultron intended to use Vibranium to carry out his Sokovian meteor to end all mankind, I intend to use my new homegym setup to carry out my plan to become gigantic. This is my rock:

It's not done yet, but it's done enough that I just completed a full-blown workout on it. Squats.  
Overhead Press.  
Curls.  
Lateral raises.  
  
I did those things in my own basement yesterday. Today I am sore from a homegym exercise. These are exciting things.  
  
Speaking of exciting - Google's big hardware announcement is tomorrow. They are unveiling the next generation of "Nexus" phone, which will take on a new branding. That I'm not so excited about - but they're going to do OTHER things which I **am** excited about. Google Home, for instance.  
  
Most importantly of all, it's rumored that they will tease "Andromeda" - the long-rumored Android/Chrome OS hybrid operating system. I am sincerely hoping that Andromeda takes over for both Chrome OS and Android and becomes the one, unified operating system that takes all the best things about Android and all the best things about Chrome OS and intelligently weaves them together to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts. I'm ready for it. I said in my last Column that I haven't seen anything impressive in tech in a while... this could be something exciting. I'm setting myself up to be massively disappointed, but my hopes are raising (rising?).  
  
Marvel's Luke Cage is on Netflix. I've only seen the first 4 or 5 episodes - but it's quality. So far so good. I'm really excited to continue watching (whenever Melissa gets time enough to watch a show!) to see how the remaining 8ish episodes play out. I don't have much else to say about it yet - I'm just going to go watch some more!  
  
Oh, and it's October. I'm re-re-restarting my now annual October tradition: The Incredible Bulk. Now that I've got a home gym, things are going to get real. See you in a month when I'm the biggest guy in the room.  
  
Top 5: Google Apps I AM Impressed With  
5\. Google Search - literally has to be on this list, you know it's the best  
4\. Google Keep - was too simple when it came out, but the addition of \#Hashtags really put it over the top for me to become one of the two apps with widgets on my homescreen  
3\. Google Docs - collaboration aside (which is its killer feature), Google Docs is surprisingly fully-featured... I built the Life Tracker in it  
2\. Google Photos - a category-ending product, nobody can do photo storage better (so far as I'm concerned)  
1\. Google Maps - the killer app of the modern era

# Motto: The Column - Now with Content!

I got Google Fiber.

![](assets/119-1.png)

For those of you who don't know what those numbers mean - the nationwide average internet speed is often quoted as 5 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up. With Google Fiber, I'm sitting at 12,545% and 62,011% those figures. I uploaded 22GB worth of Music and Videos to the cloud yesterday. It took about an hour. At 1Mbps, it would have taken 2 days and an hour. I know this because I just mathed a little.

I'd like to say "it's completely changed everything about how I view the web!" But, it hasn't really done that. The connection has been somewhat inconsistent. It varies from "absolutely fantastic" to "just good". 1080p YouTube videos either never stutter at all, or they stop to buffer every 7 or 8 seconds. I haven't yet figured out any rhyme or reason why the inconsistency exists.

**SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM GOOGLE FIBER TO MY DISCUSSION OF CABLE-CUTTING**

With Google Fiber, I now have the first DVR that I've ever had access to. I'm not a big "TV" guy, but having a DVR is still pretty nice. Having said that - I still don't see the advantage of watching a recorded show or movie over watching a show on Hulu or Netflix. I have a very strong opinion about TV, and you're about to hear it.

Television is horrible. TV shows can be good, but television is horrible. 

**Reasons TV is terrible:**

- The format of television is not even close to the most ideal method of media consumption. You like the show that's on at 6pm? You get home from work at 6:45? Tough. Even if you get home at 5 - you are stuck from 6 to 6:30 watching TV. That's when it's on, that's when you have to watch it.
    - TV shows on-demand make much more sense. Hulu. Netflix. Et cetera.
- Channel surfing is a horrible, horrible waste of time. It's like gambling. You sit there, installed at a television, hoping something good happens.
    - The internet can be the same way, admittedly. 
- TV providers, like [internet service providers](http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/verizons-diabolical-plan-turn-the-web-pay-view-226662), are notoriously horrible from a customer perspective. The customer service sucks, the prices are higher than they seem like they should be, and they always seem to be taking steps that help the business by hurting the customers.
- Total cost of basic cable: **~$50/month** is the *low end*, after you remove promotional discounts (source: [Dish](https://www.dish.com/cart1/programming_americanCore.action#), [Directv](http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/new_customer/base_packages.jsp?lpos=Header:3), [Time Warner](http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/packages/cable-internet-packages.html), and Cox's website is so convoluted, there is no one link that will clearly demonstrate how much you pay and which channels you receive - but it's over $50 if you want ESPN)
    - This $50/month gets you generally around 140 channels. Of those 140 channels, you will probably watch no more than a dozen of them with any frequency. Of that dozen, several of them are probably broadcast to your home for free already (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, etc.).
    - Pre-supposing that you already have a fast-to-decent internet connection at your house, that $50/month could get you:
        - Hulu+ (**$8**), for TV shows on-demand from the day after they air.
        - Netflix (**$8**), to expand library of movies and shows.
        - Amazon Prime (**$6.58**), to further expand the library of movies and shows and free 2 day shipping from Amazon.com (which, if you buy one thing per month from Amazon, pays for itself).
        - Google Play Music All Access or Spotify (**$10**), for any song you want, when you want it. 
        - 200 GB in Google Drive cloud storage (**$10**), for remote backup of all the music, photos, and documents on your computer, probably with some room to spare.
        - All that together is only **$42.58**/month. You can buy yourself lunch with the other $7.42.
            - Note you could do Audible audiobooks in lieu of any of these if that's what floats your boat. You'd still have cash left over.
    - If you need ESPN to watch Sunday Night Football, just go to a bar. There's 5 weekends a month. That means you can buy 2 beers each weekend and still probably come out ahead financially.
        - IF you need to watch ESPN every day. I have no solution for you. Pay for cable. 

For those reasons, after I leave Google Fiber territory, I'm definitely not going to pay for TV. I'll get the 4 or 5 channels that come for free through the air and that's all I'll need.

## And now for something completely different

I own a GoPro action camera. People who own those are obligated to make sweet videos like the following (this video is a 30 second obligation that will explain the video following).

{% include video id="OBbp7UskFB4" provider="youtube" %}

So, anyway, I finally fulfilled my obligation. See below:

{% include video id="JBexEw5t4e0" provider="youtube" %}

I have heard rumors of an upcoming GoPro improvement. By the next update I suspect I will no longer have the latest and greatest model. Stupid technology, always getting better.

There was some feedback after Wednesday's "shortest Column ever" post that I have have been considering. The reason I went to the "write on a schedule" vs. "write when I feel like it" was to force myself to write creatively about a wider array of topics. To force myself to think about and conclude things I hadn't already done and share those things. That's the zen. When enforcing a rule like that, though, I'm bound to fail on occasion. Wednesday was not a great example of the kind of post I like turning out. This isn't really up to snuff either, though. This post is too long. Too broad. 

Anyway, that's why I am writing on schedule. That and also because I like it for accounting purposes. 104 columns a year. Simple. Easy. Accountable. (I'll try to bring the entertainment to the table a little better from now on, though)

I'm still interested in transforming the Column here into a feature on a full-blown website. Sometime in the future WVZ7X7.com might become a possibly maybe reality maybe.

I'm going to go watch Don Jon.

Oh, one last thing, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is playing. It wasn't bad. I suggest watching it. On Hulu.

Motto: and now, for something completely different!  
  
My wife's name is Melissa. She and I met 6 3/4 years ago at KU in training for our new job. I was fairly recently single at that point, and pretty excited by the prospect of meeting some new girl I'd be working with and the two of us would start dating. It was just a dumb thought I had on my way down to the lobby. I remember thinking it, then immediately dismissing the idea as a wishful daydream.  
  
Only, there was someone. Several months later, we were dating. Several years later, we were engaged. On May 3rd, 2014, we were married.   
  
That was two years ago. I heard my whole life that you were supposed to get cold feet just before the wedding. I heard that things change, after you're married. I never got cold feet. And, although things did change, the only got better; so those cold feet were not necessary. We've spent the past two years together, and they have been incredible. When it comes to setting up the rest of your life, I pretty much nailed it. All skill.  
  
Speaking of spending time with awesome people, I really enjoy my coworkers. My old job had some people I enjoyed spending time with, but nothing like my new gig. I am enjoying every single person on my team, and have actively sought out team-building experiences with them. They are funny, smart, and overall just really good people. A couple days ago we did a group outing to Breakout KC. Not only did every single person show up, we kicked butts. Broke out NO PROBLEM. I'm 2 for 2 at breakout KC thus far.   
  
Continuing onward with the theme today, I want to talk very briefly and in a **Spoiler-Free** manner about **Captain America: Civil War**.  
  
I saw the midnight premier. Despite a fairly sparse and lackluster crowd, it was probably my favorite Marvel movie experience since watching the original "The Avengers" in theaters. In terms of movie quality, there's a solid argument to be made for Civil War being the strongest Marvel movie to date. I am 100% satisfied with the story, with the action, and with the overall tone of the movie. Without getting into the nitty gritty details, I've got two takeaways:  
  
1) Batman V Superman is easily bested by Civil War. A long time ago, there were some pretty fierce debates by opposing fanboys. Now that both movies have come out, there's really no debate. Civil War was by far and away better.  
  
2) I am so glad Sony and Disney are working together with Spiderman. After seeing the new iteration of Spiderman/Peter Parker, I'm more excited for the future of Spiderman in the cinema.  
  
I told you this post was going to be different.  
  
My feet got royally blistered by playing 40 minutes of basketball without proper footwear. Don't do that. My feet are on the mend. I'm officially able to walk again (only took 5 days!). I appreciate being able to walk again. Having to limp everywhere was a grim reminder of when my back first started hurting... the great thing about that though is that things are great when you're back to normal.  
  
Everything is awesome.  
  
Top 5: Pictures from the Past Week (Two photo-based Top 5's in a row! Let's go for a record!)

**EDITOR'S NOTE**: Suddenly all the images from the past (many) Columns are broken. My image host solution (Google Photos) is NOT working for me at the moment. I've attempted to fix the issue for THIS post, but the older posts will stay broken until I find a better fix going forward.


Eagle eyed readers will note this is the 2nd time I've posted a "#399" Column. I had my numbering off upon closer examination (in preparation for my 400th Column celebration... see next time). The number has since been fixed, which means you probably got duplicate email notifications for the same post on subsequent weeks. My bad. I get bothered by inconsistencyes and misteaks. That shou**ld**n't be a surpr*ise* to most of ewe.

# Apple One  
Cool. So my last post ([about subscription service](https://aarongilly.com/398) didn't age well. Apple gone and done it. They've created an Apple subscription services bundle. They named it "Apple One", and the fact that nobody I've seen has called them on their complete replication of the "Google One" subscription service naming convention just goes to show how completely nonimpactful Google One has been.

## Apple One Tiers
There are 3 levels of Apple One. All of them get you Music, Arcade, and TV+. They also each get you some level of iCloud storage, ranging from homeopathic[^1] amounts of storage, to legitimate amounts. The highest tier grants access to a couple other services as well.

| Tier       | Price            | Music | Arcade | iCloud | TV+ | News+ | Fitness+ |
|------------|------------------|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|----------|
| Individual | $15/mo (1 user)  | ✅     | ✅      | 50GB   | ✅   | ❌     | ❌        |
| Family     | $20/mo (6 users) | ✅     | ✅      | 200GB  | ✅   | ❌     | ❌        |
| Premier    | $30/mo (6 users) | ✅     | ✅      | 2TB    | ✅   | ✅     | ✅        |

### Services
If you don't know what they are.
* Apple Music - is the 2nd most-used music streaming service (behind Spotify)
* Apple Arcade - a library of curated (supposedly quite good) mobile & Apple TV games, all 100% free of advertising and microtransactions
* iCloud - the 3rd or 4th place player in the consumer cloud storage marketplace, behind Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and *maybe* Dropbox? This data is hard to find.
* TV+ - a video streaming service that exists
* News+ - a sort of mass print media bundled subscription, which gets you access to a ton of magazines & newspapers (notably NOT the New York Times, though)
* Fitness+ - seemingly a competitor to Beachbody &/or Peloton in the space of workout classes you do at home... time well tell exactly what this is

## Another Matrix of Technological Coverage
Turns out I make these sorts of lists frequently ([example 0](https://aarongilly.com/44), [example 1](https://aarongilly.com/199), [example 2](https://aarongilly.com/337), [example 3](https://aarongilly.com/378), and [example 4](https://aarongilly.com/392).

![matrix image](assets/399-1.jpg)

Note 1: this assumes you have a family of at least 3 people to consider & no pre-existing service lock-in.

Note 2: there are a ton of other details and decisions I had to make when putting that graphic together. For example, I elected NOT to include the $5/month Android Gaming service "Google Play Pass", because, well frankly it doesn't sound interesting to me personally. This is my blog get over it.

Note 3: I intended to build a much bigger table than this, including things like Software-as-a-Service, specialty services like virtual fitness club memberships (e.g. Beachbody), videogame platforms (e.g. Xbox Game Pass), and potentially even physical goods (e.g. Blue Apron, Hello Fresh)... but then I ran into the logistical problem of graphics getting too big to be readable. So I had to draw a rather arbitrary line.

### Case Breakdown
This whole post lead up to this analysis. I'm going to use it as the Top 5. See below.

# Other Apple Announcements from the Event
Since the introduction of the iPhone 11, Apple has been doing a new thing: they are putting out **really solid** "cheaper" alternatives to their top-of-the-line products. The iPhone 11 isn't as good as the iPhone 11 Pro, but it's darn good. Now the iPad and Apple Watch are getting theirs.

## iPad Air
The new 4th gen iPad Air is an iPad that *looks* like an iPad Pro, gets you a stellar processor, gets you the thinner bezel, grants you access to the Apple Pencil gen 2 (which is by far and away better than gen 1), and gets you USB C connectivity & charging. Although there are a few "gotchas" (see: 64gb base model, lower refresh rate, touch ID vs Face ID), the $600 iPad Air seems like it's *probably* "the iPad to get".

I wouldn't be surprised to see this selling like absolute madness this holiday season.

## Apple Watch SE
Unless you have medical conditions that EKGs and/or Blood Oxygen readings are good for, the $279 Apple Watch SE seems like it's "the Apple Watch to get". Call me crazy. Always on screens just aren't important enough.

I guess that's all I had to say about that. I'd like nab up one of these at some point. 

# To*done*ist
One last thing I wanted to mention - in my [previous post](https://aarongilly.com/398) about the tools I use, the 3rd digital tool on the list was "Todoist". It's a task management application, and frankly it's a *really* good one. 

Yeah we stopped using it last week. The annual subscription was due, and I looked at the built-in "Reminders" app on my phone and thought "what does Todoist do that *this* app doesn't do?". Not much, honestly. That's *not* really to say that Todoist is *bad*, it's just that Apple made their Reminders app pretty *good*. 

We've been using Reminders exclusively for the past couple weeks and, I gotta say, there's really not much of a dip in my day to day GTD efficacy. The few things that Todoist does better (more nested projects, more integrations on the web, and the ability to filter based on task assignee) are basically offset by the things that Reminders does better (great integration with Siri, location-based reminders for free, legitimate integration with iOS Shortcuts). For now, I'm quite contented.

Todoist is still my *main* recommendation for anyone who doesn't always have access to their phone... but if you *do*. I reckon the Reminders app is worth a shot.

# Top 5: Best Subscription Service Combos, by Situation
## 5. The Rich - $152/month
Pick all the things. Why choose?
## 4. The Well Off - $76/month
The Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Bundle & HBO MAX or Netflix. Apple's upcoming "One" subscription to cover music, storage, and the additional perks. And Amazon Prime.  
## 3. The Everyman - ~$46/month
Honestly the old standbys are the defacto solutions for a good reason. Rotate between Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max each month. Get Amazon Prime, Spotify, and use Google Photos and Google Drive.
## 3a. The Everyman Alt - $40/month
Pair the new "Apple One" subscription with Amazon Prime. You get music, storage, Apple TV, and some other neat perks from Apple, you get Amazon Prime Video to bolster the Apple TV catalog and get that 2-day shipping.
## 2. The Discerning Consumer - $18/month
Amazon Prime for movies, TV, and music. Google Photos and Drive. Two subscriptions. Covers most needs well enough. Not including YouTube Premium drops the Google services from $31/month to just over $8/month.
## 1. **The Broke** - $0/month
There are a litany of free options available to everyone that aren't included on my table. Utilize Google Drive's generous 15GB of storage for your documents & non-media files. Utilize Google Photos "standard" resolution for your photos and videos. Utilize YouTube (with ads) for your streaming entertainment. Utilize Libby and apps like that for access to Audiobooks. Utilize Spotify's free tier (or any music streamer, really). This barely scratches the surface of the free options out there.

Motto: When "Running to the Store" is Literally Possible

  
I've lived in five types of places in my life: 1\. In a small town 2\. In the country 3\. In a small city/big town 4\. In a big city 5\. In a suburb So far, I'm most a fan of the small city or the suburb. Rather than "write" a lot of subjective bologna about the difference between the different environments I've lived in, I'm going to present the case graphically:
  
  
| Table of Recreation   | Small Town | Country | Small City | Big City | Suburb |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| Park                  | X          | X       | X          | X        |        |
| Gym - weights         | X          | X       | X          |          |        |
| Gym - basketball      | X          | X       |            |          |        |
| Pool                  | X          | X       | X          | X        | X      |
| Pool I'd Actually Use | X          |         |            |          |        |
| Pool Table            | X          | X       |            |          |        |
| Bicycle Friendly      | X          | X       | X          | X        |        |

  
Top 5: **Specific Perks of This Suburb** 5\. Sits on the interstate I find most useful 4\. Excellent representation of places I like to eat/shop without an overwhelming amount of places I don't 3\. A source of potentially career-long employment 2\. 10 minutes to the Plaza. 10 minutes to Downtown 1\. The name lends itself to puns

# Motto: My phone is running Android 4.1, you jelly?

There is no target audience for this post. Unless you care about the new android update intensely, you shouldn't read on. This excludes everyone that I expect might tune in on a semiregular basis... hence no target audience. This is for me.

This is more of a test update than a real column. I have decided to dictate this entire post to my phone. Starting in ice cream sandwich you were able to dictate and watch the words appear as you said them. Starting in jelly bean, I plan on actually using this feature. Partially due to the siri like feature that was added. Google knowledge graph makes for a quick responses to most general inquiries.

Going back and rereading that paragraph, it is obvious to me that I speak differently than I write. Perhaps because I get the chance to think a little more when I'm typing that I do when I am speaking. Who knows.
Google I/O has got me all jazzed on technology. As most anyone who knows me would say, I don't need an excuse to be more of a technophile or a Google geek... but the feeling has been raging inside even more than usual since the first time I turned on the live broadcast of I/O. Just tonight I rooted my phone and flashed an early build of Jelly Bean. I gotta say, its nice. Its really nice. See the soon coming Top 5 for more details. I have decided I really want a pure Google experience. I elected not to reinstall many of the apps I used so much. I'm going to run a week long experiment without my Beautiful Widgets clock and weather home screen. Without a 3rd party calendar widget.

Pure.
Stock.
Nexus.
Google.

I have decided I most definitely am getting a Nexus 7 tablet when it releases. If I have to sell my transformer to do so, so be it. I want something lighter anyway. And mostly I want the nexus purity. I understand how Apple fanboys must feel.

This throws me in a couple weird situations... Google has taken to replicating the functionality of what used to be third party only functions. There is now a music recognition capability baked right in to the operating system. No need for sound hound anymore I guess. Even more vexing, Google drive and dropbox. Dropbox is great at what it does... but it does nothing more compelling than Google's drive other than offer me a few extra (hard earned) gigs of storage. I hate having two things to perform one function... something is going to give eventually.

In other news...

My sister is getting married in a little over a week. You should anticipate me talking about that soon.
Lastly, I'm updating this from the blogger mobile app. So I'm not sure how this is all going to turn out... especially the picture I attached.

# Top 5: Jelly Bean improvements IMO
5. Updated Google Play, maps, earth, music, and Google+ apps. These alone could each have their own top 5
4. Better, faster voice recognition- and the capability to use it without a data connection
3. Google Now. I haven't used it enough for it to really shine... but I'm excited for the possibility
2. The improved Google search. Its even deeper in the android system than before. Its constantly available and its expanded siri-like functionality makes it one of the best new features alone
1. All the little UI changes. The new notification bar is the obvious one, and its great... but it isn't the only thing. A lot of little things all across the system. They are hard to point out without you looking at the phone, but they are there and they ate good. This also includes the buttery goodness that I'm noticing with all the navigation and opening and closing of apps and menus.

# Quote:
> **"Why would you want to do that?"** <cite> both my parents and my girlfriend when I told them I wanted to get a new android tablet in place of the less than half a year old one I have now (they all came to see the light after I bored them about it for ten minutes) </cite>

Fun ideas are fun. But first…

# Real Quick - What I've Been Up To

## PDW V10 👁

I have spent the past many weeks going all out on the version 10 **rewrite** of my Life Tracker, Lifeline Journal, Personal Data Warehouse thing. This one should be the last ever ground-up total rewrite. This one will be built with a forward-looking, modular architecture, and include capabilities for things like “having users other than me”[^1], and supporting robust data import and data export capabilities.

It’s actually already live, but I’ve hard-coded some user auth stuff - so no links just yet.

## Podcast Hiatus 🎙

My podcast went on an indefinite hiatus, which sucks. What would suck worse, though, would be forcing it to happen and no longer having fun with it. 

## Health Stuff ♥️

My back has decided I have had it too good for too long. See [Column #406](http://aarongilly.com/406/) for more information about this (and the PDW too, actually).

Okay onto the fun stuff.

# Custom Puzzles… 🗝

A thing I haven't written about before, but you might not be surprised by: 

**I like to make puzzles.** 

If you drive around any medium-to-large town, you're probably going to find one-to-several escape rooms. Their proliferation is evidence of their breakout success[^2] over the past ~10 years. The night after I first paid to be locked in an room for an hour I was doing research on their business plan. How much were they charging for a game, what percent of their games were full, how many employees would you need, et cetera. 

Puzzles combine creativity, engineering, art, cleverness, all into one fun project. If you make a puzzle for a group to solve, then you get social aspects into the mix & you've really got an all-around awesome thing. I'm bummed that there is only a good excuse to work on a puzzle once or twice a year. 

Every year since then I've made at least one puzzle per year for one event or another. When I get started with a new one, I get very excited about it, hypothesizing all sorts of things that I won't eventually have the time to do, that will be jettisoned in favor of making the holiday deadline. 

When we told our families were going to become parents, it came via a locked box with a second locked box chained to it. 

Then, when the holiday is done, the puzzle is gone. One and done, ephemeral fun. Which is a shame. I'd love to make more. I think I'm good at it. People seem to like doing them.

## …For Hire 💵

Then it hit me - I found the [intersection of aptitude, value, and affection](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEU6vqqM1LoJR9XMjb5PgbepkAZsAB33KN01iBlP8EaH8iNnEk2trCQqGOtSwdHIENdKPbAWgI-Dm04aeDec0ulUXyA6RfZXeN2H11_Z28BplE5Qkt9AiqcbX6p831j5yvio3QiGM5k6JW8mYyruSXk7Hw=w350). In short, something that simultaneously checks the boxes of being:

1. You’re good at
2. You enjoy doing
3. The market finds valuable

So! If you're reading this and you come to a point in your life where you want to make a puzzle for a birthday, holiday, work event, or whatever reason… send me an email. 

First person to do so gets a free custom puzzle to fit their needs.



# Top 5: My Skills that are Useful for Making Puzzles



## 5. Writing, Drawing, and Experience with Video & Audio Production

Push comes to shove, I can write decently well. [I enjoy constrained writing](https://aarongilly.com/160). Combine that with  I’m not horrible at drawing either, cartoons at least. I’ve made dozens of videos and over 100 podcasts.



## 4. Organizing Systems

Organization is required all endeavors of any legitimate size, Organization is critical when you’re building something as interdependent as a collection of clues & small puzzles to make something large. I apply systems engineering techniques to puzzle development. It’s very helpful.

![mermaid-diagram-2022-09-15-165543.svg](assets/424-2.jpg)



## 3. Making

This is still a budding hobby… but given that I successfully designed and built the self-contained workbenches that house all my tools, I’m going to give myself a modicum of credit. If I had to make a box with a lid, I could do that. I’ve done woodworking on several puzzles thus far. I’ve got ideas involving full-blown making, though. Multi-media works. I’d like to do stuff with an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 3D Printing things.



## 2. Coding

I can make websites[^3]. I can make web *apps*. Last Christmas the backbone of the puzzle was a custom website written with zero dependencies using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Now I could turn out that same type of thing on any one of multiple web hosts in ~1/5th the time using [my own home-grown NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrapper-lib)… or I could stop being lazy/indecisive and commit to relearning React, or picking up Vue or Svelte and probably be way *way* faster.



## 1. The Ability to Focus

You really need to be — 🐿 OH LOOK!

# Motto: Pick your poison... and by poison I mean most interesting and useful thing in the modern world..

This is my master tech comparison review. If you don't like reading about this stuff... just pretend like update 44 doesn't exist… except the Top 5 and the Quote. Those are still good. Just a fair warning - this is a super-long post. It's a grand master summary of my feelings about Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

There are three major players behind the scenes and/or at the forefront of the consumer tech industry today: Apple, Google, and Microsoft. This column will compare all three on the following fronts:

1. Flagship phone offerings
2. Flagship tablet offerings
3. Flagship computer offerings
4. Final considerations
5. A very brief wrap up

## 1. Flagship phone offerings
### Apple: iPhone 5
The iPhone, since its original debut over 5 years ago, has been held the golden standard of smartphone prowess. The competition was, at first, anemic and laughably, haphazardly thrown together. This, unfortunately for Apple, is no longer the case. Still, the iPhone 5 is a true American* beauty. It is a simple and wholly consistent device- I mean this in terms of user interface, hardware, and overall performance. Consumers know what they are paying for when they buy one, and generally they get just that. Apple’s phone hardware, since the iPhone 4, is inarguably beautiful and capable. The Apple ecosystem is mature, robust, time-tested and thoroughly refined. The iPhone 5 is a truly capable performer in every facet of competition. It is a great phone and will continue to be a great phone for the foreseeable future. Its hardware and software, much like the iPhones before it, are both simple and exquisite. In general, Apple did the world a huge favor by removing the “you must be at least this nerdy to ride” requirements smartphones used to have. They completely and utterly redefined what entails a “smartphone”, and have been delivering on that definition for many years now. Having said all that, it is hard to argue against the opinion that Apple has went from being the undisputed leader of mobile innovation, to catching up with those that have now outran it. To summarize, I will steal a quote from a Google+ user, Ivan Raszi - “iPhone is like a Bond car with leather stitching. It not only takes you from A to B, but also makes you smile if you look at it and guarantees and enjoyable driving experience. It gets the job done effectively and in style. Little awkward when you park it next to the same model only in white at the casino when you really meant to go to the opera.”
* Designed in America, made in some 3rd world country for 5 cents labor cost
### Google: Nexus 4
Android phones are the antithesis of the iPhone. The high walls of Apple’s sanctuary are nowhere to be found. In fact, if Google had it its way, there would be no walls around Android at all. That is exactly what their Nexus program is all about. With Android comes a culture of freedom. Freedom to choose between dozens flavors of Android hardware and software. Sony, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, LG, and ASUS each have their own hardware running their own unique flavors of Android. Four years ago, with the debut of the Nexus One, a pure, unadulterated Android experience has been available. The forth and most recent generation of this choice is the Nexus 4, by LG. Its hardware has a beauty on par with or surpassing that of the iPhone (beauty, as it turns out, is in the eye of the beholder). Its software has a level of simultaneous polish and capability never before seen in the Android world. It is smart, capable, and most importantly, free in all the ways the iPhone is not. It is extremely inexpensive- but not “cheap”.  The price, $300 unlocked, removes the last remaining walls surrounding Android. It can be had by those without high-paying jobs. It can be had by those who despise the idea of signing two-year contracts. It can be had by anyone in almost any situation, and it will perform very well for them. Google is doing a beautiful thing here, more on that later.
### Microsoft: Lumina 920
Strangely, the oldest player in the smartphone market has become its newest contender. My first smartphone ran Windows Mobile 6.0. “User experience” was not a term they considered much back then, and I’m glad to report they have come a long way since those days. However, being that Windows Phone 8 is so new, I have little-to-no first-hand experience with a Windows Phone. I cannot claim any opinions of the software or the hardware through my own observations. What I can say, even without experience, is that Microsoft has a hefty price to pay for letting Android and iOS reign unchallenged for so long. Its app ecosystem is paltry and the OS has had to fight to remove the “we make a terrible smartphone” label that Microsoft has had for so long. Nokia, much like Microsoft, was a big-time player in the phone world before the introduction of the capacitive touchscreen and the iPhone changed everything. It seems fitting that they have pinned their hopes of revival on Windows Phone 8. The Nokia Lumina 920 has met mostly positive reviews. It has been praised for its camera. It has been shunned for its size and weight. The one thing that remains to be seen is this: will it be at all relevant? For Nokia’s sake, I hope so. For Microsoft’s sake it’s just important, but I don’t care as much.

## 2. Flagship tablet offerings
### Apple: the iPad and the iPad Mini
Again, you have to credit Apple with both redefining and creating a strong consumer desire for a formerly niche-market-only form factor. The original iPad, which debuted somewhere around 4 years ago, was scoffed at for being “nothing but a large iPod touch”; and this is a valid summary. Many people at the time (including me) expected it to be a hybrid of Apple’s mobile and computer operating systems. When they went the route of mobile-only, some tech enthusiasts were letdown (including me, again). This didn’t stop Apple from singlehandedly upending the market for cheap personal computing devices. Netbooks were all the rage back then… now they are dead. Tablets have killed them. And for that, Apple, I thank you. The iPad and its hundreds of thousands of tailored applications have been seen by many as the only real tablet offering out there - recently, this hasn’t been so much the trend. The iPad is now in its 4thgeneration, and it is still a wonderful and entertaining piece of consumer technology. It’s fast, well-built, and fits nicely into the walled sanctuary Apple has meticulously constructed. It has been embraced by tech-heads, children, hipsters, parents and grandparents alike. The recent introduction of the first-generation iPad Mini has been, in my humble opinion, entirely underwhelming; underwhelming in a different way than the original iPad launch, though. The iPad Mini is underwhelming by comparison… but that hasn’t stopped it from being (what looks like) a home-run for Apple’s first foray into the world of “small” tablets. Personally, I am not a fan of the iPad Mini’s chosen particular form factor. The 3x4 aspect ratio is awkward for a small tablet. Portrait and landscape don’t really have separate uses, they are too similar. The Mini’s screen is not much smaller than the regular iPad, 7.9” as compared to 9.7”… a difference of 1.8 inches diagonally. The price, also, is not much smaller than the regular iPad. The size and price tend to put it at an awkward in-between stage from its bigger brother and its smaller, less expensive Android competitors. I’m not even going to bad mouth the screen’s pixel count or the processor, it’s just too easy.
### Google: Nexuses 7 and 10
Google has recently extended its pure-Android experience Nexus program into the world of tablets. The first of its two contenders for your money is the Nexus 7, a small, inexpensive-yet-more-than-capable performer. I ordered the Nexus 7 the day it was announced. It’s $200 price tag puts it nearly into the realm of “impulse buy” for some. I expected it to be a toy of mine which would never really replace the ASUS Transformer+keyboard 10” Android tablet I had at the time. Boy was I wrong. The Nexus 7 didn’t take up most of my tablet screen-time… it took up all of it. Honestly, the size difference between a 7 inch 16x9 tablet and a 10 inch tablet changes the way you think about the device entirely. It becomes a constant companion. It is small and light enough to go with you wherever you go… it is a much more personal experience. Relevant side note here, the difference between screen sizes on the popular Android tablets is 3 to 3.1 inches… much more significant than Apple’s 1.8”. Anyway, the Nexus 7 has a build quality and, more importantly, performance that DEFINITELY makes it feel like a more expensive tablet. I have been thoroughly impressed and couldn’t recommend the Nexus 7 more to anyone looking into a “personal sized” tablet. The Nexus 10 is Google’s new baby. It enters the market $100 cheaper than the iPad that it outperforms on many levels. The device has an ultra-high resolution screen (higher than the one Apple bragged about constantly), very capable processor, and, like its two smaller Nexus siblings, my favorite operating system of all time. Legitimate complaints about Android as a tablet OS: Its application selection is much weaker than the mighty iPad. As of right now, disappointingly few apps take advantage of the increased screen real-estate. Many apps are just blown-up versions of those made for phones… not very compelling. There are, however, more than enough to keep me satisfied – especially since my discovery of free game console emulators.
### Microsoft: Surface
Microsoft has engrained a tablet version of their desktop Windows 8 OS into their very first (as far as I’m concerned) hardware offering: Windows Surface. I have never seen a true Surface tablet in person, but this weekend I DID see an ASUS (or possibly Acer?)-branded tablet running Windows RT, the version of the new Windows OS that doesn’t support legacy (read: anything you’ve ever installed on your home computer) applications. The tablet hardware was nice – very much like (read: exactly like) the Android-running hardware that company already offers (for ~$100 less). Windows tablets run Microsoft Office and whatever applications you can find in the recently opened Windows Store. Gone are the days of individual vendors putting out CDs of their software into brick-and-mortar buildings, every OS has its own associated store. The Windows Store is currently both the newest and the most sparse of them all. Time will tell if that will change. Back to Surface, though, my impressions are that it (and its nifty keyboard/cover) tries to straddle the fence between tablet and computer a little too hard. It performs less-capably than two cheaper devices designed for a single purpose. To put it another way, Surface is too expensive and lacks the speed and 3rd party development of its competitor(s). Microsoft has no 7 inch “personal sized” tablets. So, that’s that.

## 3. Flagship computer offerings (I won’t go into much)
### Apple: the iMac, Macbook Pro, and Macbook Air
Apple, once an on-the-ropes contender in the realm of traditional desktop computers with traditional full-fledged operating systems (at the time, these were simply known as “computers”), has created the number one highest-grossing laptop, ultrabook, and desktop PC today. The iComputers, as I’ll call them, are very much like the iPhone in many regards – they run an Apple-designed operating system on Apple-designed hardware, they are among the most aesthetically pleasing options out there, and they are (arguably) way more expensive than they realistically should be. However, consumers by the millions have proven themselves willing to pay “the Apple tax” to get their hands on the latest and greatest products from your friendly neighborhood supercorporation. This is probably because Macs are really nice,and if you have an iPhone or iPad they work really really well together. Within its walls, Apple has built a sanctuary. It is truly a sight to be seen. It is a very nice (and very expensive) setup. I can really appreciate the integration and purity of a purely-Apple system. At one point, I strongly considered going that route… but I never did… and I doubt I ever will.
### Google: Chromebooks and the “this is a thing?” Chromebox
Google actually DOES have an operating system designed to run on traditional computers. Chrome OS is an interesting idea to say the least; but it’s just not practical as a complete computing solution for the average end-user. For those of you who don’t know, Chrome OS is an operating system that is essentially just a gateway to the internet. It isn’t designed to do anything really outside of the Chrome browser. While the internet is amazing and wonderful and capable of a LOT more than some people give it credit for – I still don’t think it’s quite capable of replacing everything I use a computer for. I’m not sure if Google’s intent was to replace your home computer, so much as it was to supplement it… I hope it was the latter. Chrome OS is nifty, and I’m glad it exists… but it can’t stand up on its own as a valid “my only computer” option.
### Microsoft: Any Windows 8 device
Microsoft perfected its traditional desktop OS with Windows 7. The fact that I start off by saying that should tell you my opinion of Windows 8 implicitly; in case it wasn’t clear, though, I’ll just say this: I don’t like Windows 8. It’s gaudy. It’s weird. It’s unlike what I’m used to and it’s not what I’m looking for in a computer. Now, I will always try to stay up on the basics of all current operating systems on all relevant form-factors. I refuse to be an incompetent old man who never evolved past the era that was popular when he was growing up… but man… Windows 8 is making it hard on me. The operating system was designed with touch in mind – which isn’t a bad thing, so long as you HAVE a touchscreen… but I’m not interested in getting a desktop PC that I have to poke at. I honestly believe that, when sitting at a desk, the keyboard and mouse are a much more natural input than reaching your arm up and touching the screen. I am not interested in carrying around a half-laptop-half-tablet that performs 75% as well as either would on a specialized device. I am building a computer soon, and it will most certainly NOT be running Windows 8. I will avoid diving into that pool for as long as humanly possible. Who knows, though, I could be wrong and this could all be a terrible travesty.

## 4. Final considerations
In general – all three companies aim to invest you into their ecosystems. All three offer their own web browser, office programs, application store, music and video stores, cloud services, hardware solutions, and mobile and traditional operating systems. Two of them offer online search. Two of them offer email. Once you dive whole-heartedly into their systems, they each have their own unique spin, their own flare, complete with advantages and disadvantages on all sides. I will stay surface-level here, partly because I’m not invested in Apple or Microsoft and partly (mostly) because this post is godawfully long already.
### The Apple Biome:
All hail Apple for its uniformity and polish. You pay a premium to get premium devices running in a premium software biome. I use a nature-inspired vernacular because going entirely Apple is a very natural experience. Their business model is to sell a top-of-the-line consumer experience to you directly, with a significant (read: 30% to 40% more) premium. The Apple is NOT the only game in town offering these levels of fit and finish, but they ARE the only game in town who ONLY offers these levels of fit and finish. Having an iPhone, iPad, and Macbook Pro is one of the holy-trinities of technological perfection. The software and hardware were designed by the same company. They share the same vision and were designed specifically to suit one another. They are both pure and impressively capable. They will almost always out-perform devices with similar specifications at their intended task. Because they offer no low-end devices, they do not have to make any sacrifices. Safari is a very popular and current web browser. ITunes is the most popular of all online media stores (I’m guessing, here). The original “The App Store” is the most robust of them all. Apple shines with media production, but has weak native office programs (sorry, iWork). Their relatively new service “iCloud” might serve as a brilliant introduction of the advantages of cloud storage to the masses. Apple has very successfully lowered the need for prerequisite technological know-how without lowering the bar on end-user experience. It’s worth mentioning again the price disparity between Apple and its competitors. Apple is offering a Macbook pro with Retina display for $2600. For that price, you could get a Windows laptop with better specs, a second monitor, AND a full surround sound system (just for fun).
### The Google Utopia:
Google’s motto “Don’t be evil”, their open-source ways, and their business model are all entirely utopian in nature. I love it. Google has established itself as a very successful company using a business model that is, as I see it, a win-win-win. Google offers the us end-users GREAT products and services at no cost. In exchange, they serve us advertisements that are tailored to our specific needs. Advertisers get their ads seen by those likely to be interested by them. Google gets paid by the advertisers. And society gets all the goodness that Google offers for free. Google embraced the cloud and the internet by leaps and bounds moreso than Apple and Microsoft. This gives them many distinct advantages. Google Docs is easily the best collaborative office program out there. You can throw your Chromebook off a bridge, go to the store, get a new one (for $250, btw) and pick up exactly where you left off. Your documents and pictures and contacts and email are all backed up in case you ever had some sort of catastrophic event in which you lost all your devices at once (you threw your phone at your computer so hard they both broke… or… you know… a house fire). Google the quality of Google search and Gmail are unmatched (sorry Microsoft, I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul). Google offers its software free of charge, which allows hardware manufacturers to sell it to us cheaper. This is why Microsoft’s Surface is $100 more expensive than an Android tablet with the same specs. This is why the Nexus 4 sells unlocked for prices you used to have to sign contracts to get. Google Play has become arguably the neatest and best content store currently available. It offers apps, music, movies, TV, books, magazine, and physical hardware devices all from a unified, beautiful digital storefront.  Not everything is perfect yet, however. Google lacks a real “my only computer” solution… and until they can offer one, you’re always going to have to rely on somebody else. Also, Google has been unfocused historically. A few of their projects and products have either died or become abandonware (I’m looking at you, Google Tasks); and their recent attempt at focusing and integrating their products revolves around Google+ - a social network that is tragically still lacking the adoption rates enjoyed by Facebook. Regardless, I’m a Googler through and through.
### The Microsoft Ball:
Microsoft is trying. They are trying hard to be what Apple has become. They want you to use search Bing on Internet Explorer using your Windows 8 touchscreen whatever. They want you to use Windows SkyDrive to store your Office documents and Xbox Music to buy and stream your “tunes”. They want you to email your “buddies” from Outlook.com and use Skype to chat with your “best friends”. Microsoft, however, seems too out-of-touch, too out-there, and too far removed from the direction I want to go. Like an old white man who wears his hat sideways with is sandals and socks because he suddenly decided he wanted to be cool and hip, it seems like they just didn’t quite get it right. Windows “Modern” (Metro) UI is gaudy and awful and godawful. Microsoft LOVES big businesses - and have really succeeded when it comes to corporate adoption… but they did that years ago… using the versions of Windows that actually had windows. They will continue to reign supreme in the business world for quite some time, despite their venture into left-of-left field territory with Windows 8. This is onlybecause big businesses have a real investment in old Microsoft, and changing their ways now would be exceedingly difficult. If Microsoft doesn’t do something different with Windows 9, a mass exodus from the Windows ecosystem is entirely possible.

## 5. A very brief wrap-up:
All three companies offer perfectly legitimate lineups for total technological solutions. They each have their own niche, their own feel, and their own direction. Here’s the wtl;dr (waaay too long; didn’t read):
### Apple:
Apple offers great products all the way around, if you can afford them. They don’t have to make compromises for low-tier hardware and can provide a wonderful, if not a little too “one of us, one of us”, user experience. Apple gets an A for user experience, but a much worse overall grade when it comes to price (and my general opinion of their abuse of the patent system to demolish competition).
### Google:
Google is great. Their online prowess is unmatched and their business model is nothing short of amazing. The low price required to buy all the way into their ecosystem is not reflected in its quality. Their offerings are all top-notch. They could use more 3rd party development for Android tablets, and if they ever made a legitimate desktop OS that could run a decent video editor, I would pee my pants. A++, would recommend.  
### Microsoft:
The once undisputed king of the castle grew frumpish and fell like a fledgling fawn. Their left-of-left field approach seems futile and foolish. I give the Microsoft an F (actually, I’ve given them several). I hope I’m wrong. Maybe if I spent a month with a Windows Phone 8 phone and Windows 8 RT tablet and Windows 8 computer I might change my tune… I just don’t think I would. For now, I suggest having a Windows 7 computer and Microsoft Office, but nothing Microsoft has done in the past year.

# Motto: My health? It's gone viral.

I fell ill Monday night. At 8pm on Monday I decided I needed to go to bed because I was tired. Then I realized I was freezing. Then I realized I was sore everywhere. Then I swore silently to myself.

I had caught the flu. Or a virus. Or something.

Here's the timeline:
8pm, Monday - 8pm, Tuesday: Never left bed. Not to pee. Not at all.
8pm, Tuesday - 8am Wednesday: Used restroom. Refilled my water bottle. Moved from bed to couch because bed was COVERED in broken fever sweat.
8am, Wednesday - 8pm Wednesday: Forced a shower. Tried to work some, huge mistake. Fell back asleep for a few hours. Woke up again COVERED in broken fever sweat. Watched some Community.
8pm Wednesday - 8am Thursday: Ate some Greek Yogurt and a Clif bar - first food in >36 hours. Took meds for the first time (more on that in a second). Woke up, finally feeling most of the way better.

About the meds: Why did I wait so long to take them? The answer is that I experienced one or two delusional thoughts while I was down. One was that I didn't have any pills because they were all at my parent's house (which is not accurate) - the other was that I was leaving for Thailand today (literally today), instead of in 3 weeks. I believed both of those things so fully that I tried making phone calls. The phone didn't work, though. The touch screen wouldn't respond. I still don't know why - could be because it was also covered in sweat (capacitive touchscreens don't work so well when covered with a conductive substance) or it could be for some other reason that my 100+ degree brain couldn't comprehend. Either way, I successfully made neither of those calls.

I got a flu shot - yet I still got the flu. I'm pretty sure there's a lawsuit in there somewhere.

It was probably a virus, though.

Today is Pi day, 3.14. Today's date combined with the arbitrary way we line up dates in America bear a striking resemblance to the first 3 digits of the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter. 

In high school, a couple of friends and I memorized Pi out to 50 something digits. This wasn't done out of pure boredom. It wasn't done with planning and forethought. One day, Josh found Pi written in a book as "3.14159". He remembered those extra three digits until the next morning when we saw each other again.

"Hey dude, did you know the next 3 digits of Pi are '159'?"

I did not. But I made a mental note to Google it, see if he was wrong, and memorize an additional digit on top of him.

He wasn't wrong. I memorized '2' - it actually should be a '3' with rounding, but I decided not to trifle with such frivolities. The next day in school -

"Hey, Josh, did you know the next digit of Pi is a 2? 3.141592".

And it was on.

Over the next month, we came into school each day having memorized another 2 to 4 additional digits of Pi. We made it just past the point I can remember to today:

3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399

You might be thinking "Aaron, any idiot can copy and paste something from the internet" - and you have every right to question me. But, if you do doubt, I ask you to write those 46 characters and ask me what they are the next time you see me.

Actually, since I like the number 47, I'm going to WORK on remembering that the next digit is a 3. Or maybe I'll remember 3751 and make it an even 50.

Here's the only picture I've taken since the last update to this one.

Yes, I left off 5,4, and 2 on purpose. The flu sucks... and every time I write it I write "flue" and feel stupid. So it double-sucks.

There's a quote from Age of Ultron that I keep thinking of: 

> When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it. - Ultron


That 'stone' was COVID. Things were one way. Then the world was changed. We all started living differently. Now the vaccine is readily available[^1] and things are starting to change again. Will we go back to life as usual? I don't think so. 

**Nobody I know isn't in some stage of a major life change.** 

Houses are being bought & sold. Children are being had. Weddings are being planned. Soul-searching trips are being undertook. The pandemic put us into a new mode of existence. It seems like, separately, we all thought about who we are and who we want to become. Life is going back to "normal", but "normal" won't mean "the same as before". 

![https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499244571948-7ccddb3583f1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb](assets/410-1.jpg)

# Change.

Once you stop changing, you start dying. People who retire to pursue "a life of luxury" tend to die within a couple years. People who retire to pursue their passions *t*end to live much longer. Change isn't 'a part' of life - it is **most** of life, really. Change comes for us one way or another. You can bring it upon yourself or let it happen to you by way of some outside force.

**Things don't have to be bad for "something new" to be a good idea**.


For my wife and I, life is pretty great. We have a stellar routine worked out. We make enough money to continue doing exactly what we've been doing indefinitely. We are in a comfortable area — in terms of our house, our jobs, our relationships with everyone we know. We have grown into a **very** stable pattern of living. We've matured our systems and processes to a point where we're tinkering at the margins to eke out some semblance of further improvement. We could feasibly continue in simple "maintenance mode" indefinitely and nobody would bat an eye. 

It's that realization that caused me[^2] to want to change everything.

# Physical Move

We are buying a house in a different city. 

![https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601467995997-ac1ae9a8fff4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb](assets/410-2.jpg)

We currently live in a split-level house in a suburb of Kansas City. We live on a quiet street, in a middle class neighborhood. The kind of place that people around here retire to[^3]. It's comfortable. It's nice enough. It's not falling down, nor in need of obvious repair. It's not too big, nor too small. It's conveniently located with quick access to a lot of niceties.

But it's not perfect. It's not someplace we are **thrilled** to live. Life is too short to live someplace you're not thrilled about.

## Lawrence, Kansas

We are moving to Lawrence, Kansas. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3f-Qm-DV5fwdb8LYP7cus4qcLbvWsDzBKwtHRUiPn1hWt1j49aEJcW5oTlDmdWkAM6xk5XS1rA7o3AsQAFsB3pZs_Lf6c4eJ_E0KTWH2kUJm9gNMl69IKvkAfDEdPRt0V2Jb8_coX74iSKCM1jeK_p3oQ=w500-h108-no?authuser=0](assets/410-3.png)

Lawrence, best known as the home of The University of Kansas, is one of my favorite places in the world. It's where I got my bachelor's degree and met many of my best friends, including the one I married[^4].

I wrote a big section here about why we love Lawrence and why it's such a good fit for our next steps, but it wound up being too long & personal. Suffice to say, we're thrilled with the prospect of spending the next foreseeable future in Lawrence.

## Unburdening of Stuff

We had a garage sale last month in which we successfully unloaded a not-insignificant proportion of what we owned. This, however, is just the beginning. As always happens when you're looking to move, you notice how **much** you have to move. Things like "the desk I'm sitting at" are on the chopping block. I put 30% of my clothes into the sale. I'm looking at another 30% wondering why they made the cut. 

I have to fight a non-insignificant urge to purge *everything* and *truly* start from scratch in the new place. Maybe I should? Maybe I shouldn't. 

# Digital Move

The physical world is not the only domain of upheaval in our lives lately. A confluence of events pushed us past a tipping point here lately. Even the most casual of observers will notice a theme here...

## Apple TV 🍏📺

A while back [I wrote about the De-Googling of my life]({{siteurl}}/398/#de-googling). At that time I switched from Google to Amazon. 

Google Homes Out, Alexas in. 

Chromecasts out, FireTV in.

Well, with the recent FireTV UI change it was clear to me Amazon's intent with the platform was to prioritize advertising over user experience. A full 80% of the screen real-estate is dedicated to content I "could" get, rather than content I wanted. So I voted with my wallet.

FireTV out, Apple TV in.

We're still getting used to the user interface, for sure. There are some kinks we want to work out (for example, better parental controls), but overall I'm quite pleased with the switch. When I kick on the AppleTV, the shows I actually *watch* are what I see. Not advertisements for Bosch. The thing is snappy and responsive. The integration with the iPhone is pretty slick, too. Airplay is every bit as good as Chromecast is, and it's baked into the operating system. I'm looking forward to getting a controller compatible with the device to give some of the Apple Arcade games a whirl.

## iCloud 🖥️☁️

With the recent switch in Google Photos storage policy *(in case you hadn't heard, any new content you upload to Google Photos will count toward your Google Drive storage allotment*), we decided to give iCloud a try (via a subscription to [Apple One](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/). Thus far - it seems to work great?

Honestly, I can't really tell you how iCloud works just yet, because it turns out Google lock-in is *very real*. Getting albums and photos out of Google Photos is by no means trivial. Straight copy & pasting of Google Drive folder contents into an iCloud folder doesn't *really* work either... because your Google Docs and Google Sheets files aren't *really* files, they're more like hyperlinks. It turns out I've been using Google Docs & Sheets for basically everything for the past half dozen years (or more). So it turns out that moving away from Google Drive isn't *just* a matter of changing where my files are stored, it would involve changing the whole paradigm of **how** they are stored. This is going to be a heavier lift, if we continue to go through with it.

## Apple Music 🍎🎵

In a weird turn of events, Google's photo storage policy change maybe means Spotify is about to lose customers. They have lost us, at least temporarily, as we try out Apple Music as part of our new Apple One subscription. 

Honestly, they're both great. I'm pleased as punch with Apple Music pretty much immediately. Melissa, who was way way more "into the weeds" with Spotify has *also* made the transition very successfully, it seems.

# Top 5: Personal Systems Approaching Perfection


## 5. Notion, in general


Notion is the Swiss army knife of productivity tools. It doesn't force you to use it in any particular way, it gives you a wildly powerful toolset and lets you make of it what you will. That means, though, that you have to tinker around with it a while to tune your Notion setup to your liking. If you're more interested in this topic, just Google "Notion setup tour" and you'll find a ridiculous quantity of people who are happy to show you how they made it work for them. Notion is used for my project management system, periodic reviews, and my [Notes database](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea).

This Column (along with all others nowadays) is being drafted in Notion. I make good use of their ability to create custom templates for your stuff. I have templates for new Columns, new WSaM episodes, new (generic) projects, amongst many other things.

## 4. Recipes, Groceries, & Cooking


I take ~3% credit on this, the rest goes to my wife. She could (and perhaps *should*) write an entire blog about this. We have a system, enabled by the app "Paprika 3", managed by my wife, that lets both of us cook a wide variety of healthy meals with relatively little effort and, more importantly, almost no waste.

## 3. My Cascading Periodic Reviews


I am a big fan of the concept of periodic reviews. You set aside some time every so often to stop and look back at what's been going on, how things have been going, and what you want to do soon. My reviews happen annually, monthly, weekly, and nightly. I wrote just a bit more about them in [Column 401]({{siteurl}}/401/#review-cycles).

## 2. My Personal Data Warehouse


Putting this on here is a bit disingenuous. This whole concept has gone through a double-digit number of iterations. It may be something I tinker with indefinitely. That's hardly "perfect". At its core, though, it does exactly what I want it to do. I've successfully maintained it for nearly a decade. I can quickly and easily write to and read from my existing personal datasets. It's neat.

## 1. This Website


This website is everything I ever wanted, honestly. I'm still in the middle of transitioning my old posts *(#101 thru #395 still currently outstanding)* to a new, Markdown-based format; at which point the entire body of work will be *(more)* future-proof. In the meantime, though, I already have control over look & feel, content, organization, and can, in general, make it do whatever I want — up to and including presentation of useless home-grown web apps:

<button class="btn btn--info btn--x-large" onclick="buttonTrack()">See Example of Useless Web App</button>

# **Quote:**


> Boom! The end. Start again. <cite>Ultron</cite>


[^1]: In America, for people who aren't idiots.

[^2]: This may or may not also be the reason my wife is interested in changing things. I won't presume I have the authority to share her reasoning on my website.

[^3]: How do I know? Because every neighbor we have is retired.

[^4]: Married *in Lawrence*, to boot.

# Motto: Short and Sweet.

The last summer of my life is coming to a close. I know this because the lease on the apartment I'm in is about up. We are moving out next weekend. 7 days from now. From now until retirement, I'm just going to be working. I hope vacation time is like summer time. Maybe I hope to make a career in something that naturally gives me a couple weeks off here or there. Maybe something with lots of travel for the next few years. Maybe.

Today I spent a bit of quality time with some friends that, in all likelihood, I will only see once more, if ever again. It was good times. I am glad I got to have them.

Also today - I realized that I had no "goal" in mind with my desire to get in (better) shape. I have never really stopped and thought, "what super-tall guy would I want to be like". This lead me on a thought tangent that ended up down a line of Google searches I never thought I would ever make. I winded up with a few aspirations. If I could size up a dozen or so pounds in the right places I think I could have played Colossus in X-Men 2 and 3. That's this dude:

![colossus](assets/21-1.jpg)

He (the actor, Daniel Cudmore) is between 6'6" and 6'8" depending on what website you believe. He is large. But not humongous. My first goal's set. 

Now I just have to work out and eat right. That's the easy part, right?

This is a follow-on to a previous post examining/explaining my personal productivity system. 

# As Previously Presented

At the beginning of 2020, just before the pandemic, I made this image and put it in [Column #385](385) :

![Previous architecture flowchart](assets/385-1.png)

Whew. There's a **lot** to that. 

## What's Changed

The system is now (mostly) Notion-based, and a bit simpler to handle on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis.

### What's Not Held Up

I don't *hate* any of what I came up with up there, but some of it didn't stand the rest of time.

- **Identity Statement** - this felt like a good exercise at the time, but it's not something I've looked at our thought about since
- **Challenge List** - I stopped doing 30 Day Challenges, I couldn't keep my commitments to myself

That's actually it. I thought more had ended up failing, but really what's happened is that I've internalized most of it, or established reminders & templates that have made keeping it up pretty easy.

### What's Been Added

I've not added much. Complexity is the enemy of longevity when it comes to operating systems. That said there are two new entrants.

- **Streaks** - I've been fairly vocal about the iOS app "Streaks" being a massive positive impact in my life. It's woven in now.
- **Quarterly Review** - a super short added review

# The Current System

The current system is not *terribly* dissimilar to the previous one. I’ve migrated my “Getting Things Done” system into Notion, which I adore; but there is no reason this couldn’t be done elsewhere. The general structure is platform agnostic[^1].  

This is a lot prettier, at the expense of being a little less descriptive

![[441-1.svg]]

The system is composed of **lists** of different types of things, and **periodic reviews** which dictate when each list should be used.

## Not Shown

For the sake of maintaining *some* level of simplicity, I haven’t included a few components and processes in the image above.

### Components: 

- **PDW** - the Personal Data Warehouse I built, this is hooked into the nightly review & my Goals > KPIs are mostly PDW-based
- **iOS Streaks app** - a daily checklist, reminds me to hit Inbox Zero daily
- **Siri & iOS “Shortcuts” app** - can read from and write to my Notion tasks/inbox and my Personal Data Warehouse.
- **iOS “Reminders” app** - for location-based reminders, and as a secondary inbox
- **Google Apps Script** - is how I achieve recurring tasks in Notion
- **Notion Home Page** - a dashboard of active tasks, projects, and goals
- **Mint** - the finance app, for mostly passive money observation

### Processes: 

- **Inbox Zero** - the Streaks app reminds me to get to inbox zero
- **Nightly Review** - my Personal Data Warehouse has a nightly entry

## Details

A few. Less than I *was* going to write.

### Tasks

My Notion "Tasks" Database house project tasks and miscellaneous tasks. Tasks do not link to one-another, because that just confuses things (e.g. "is this a task with sub-tasks? Or should it be a Project?"). If a task would have sub-tasks, I just put them in the body of the page.

My Tasks database have 4 properties for managing their priority/visibilitiy:
- **Date** - (date) my "do" date
- **Deadline** - (date) my "due" date
- **Flagged** - (checkbox) for floating things to the top
- **Maybe** - (checkbox) for hiding things without deleting them

There are some other fields that are calcuated off those, but those are the main ones. If none of of those are set, an 'Inbox' property (formula) will set as true. 

My main task view shows tasks with (Date = today) or (Deadline is within a week) or (Flagged = true). This keeps the list short enough to be manageable, doesn't force me to set arbitrary "due" dates for things that don't need them (like posting this Column, for example), and keeps things with **actual** deadlines from blending in with things I just "plan" to do on a specific day.

Task recurrence is managed via another property titled `Recur`. Nightly I have a Google Apps Script that looks to re-up recurring tasks according to their `Recur` value. [Here's my GitHub repo for that](https://github.com/aarongilly/notion-recurring-tasks/blob/main/Code.gs), if you're interested.

### Periodic Reviews

This post is running long, here come some bullets explaining what I do in each of my periodic reviews.

- Nightly Review
    - write down how my day went
    - rate my level of satisfaction with the day and how my health is
    - Look at tomorrow's calendar
- Weekly Review
    - Preview the week's calendar and tasks
    - Look at active Projects, if they're not actually "active" then I move them to "on hold" status
    - Flag a few Project Tasks for the week
    - Categorize transactions in Mint
- Monthly Review
    - Look at Goals (Objectives) for this quarter
    - Set intermediate Goals (Key Results) for each month (or so)
    - Look at Tasks marked as "Maybe"
    - Do some housekeeping things (e.g. backing up photos)
- Quarterly Review
    - Set a new Goal (Objective) for the upcoming quarter
- Annual Review
    - Write a Column
    - Think about life and stuff
    - Update my 5 Year Plan

# Everything Else

## Aging

I turned 35. That’s still young, right?

My oldest started kindergarten. That’s still young, right?

## Business (Read: Busy-ness)

My family is amidst a **very dense streak** of fun things. Honestly not since college have I felt this "busy". how I'm managing to write this right now is beyond me. The Columns may continue to roll out slowly for the next several months. I'm sure you're devestated.

## The MCU

The Multiverse Saga is such a bummer. It's not *terrible*, like the headlines would lead you to believe; but the whole thing just feels so much less special than the Infinity Saga did. I looked through Disney+ and saw so many movies from Endgame & before that are all-timers for me... and *since* Endgame there's only been a few that have registered as blips on my radar. 

On a long enough timeline, the survival rate of everything drops to zero. Even my hardcore MCU fandom.

Per my last Column, I just got a new one. It's on the desk here. I like it.



## 1. Backpacks

I bought a new one of these, too. Osprey Daylight. I like it.

[^1]: If Notion were to suddenly go away, I’d probably be sad for a day then migrate to a few different apps to house different aspects of the system. Obsidian and the built-in iOS Productivity apps are both quite capable.

# Motto: "If I had an hour to save the world I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute finding solutions"


The motto today was brought to you by Albert Einstein. It will come into play later.  Today is Monday. 7 days ago was a different Monday. On that Monday I started my project. I seek to educate you on my project, its goals, and how I've gone about trying to meet them.  Life only seems to get more hectic as you get older. Kids have little responsibility until they get into school. In school you slowly have things added to your plate. Then you go to college and there's a lot going on. After college comes real life, which is similarly challenging. Each stage gives you more and more to lose. Failure goes from getting a bad grade that doesn't really matter, to getting a bad grade that might end up mattering, to all the possible ways you could mess up real life (going broke, getting sick, doing nothing with your life, etc). This is a problem. To solve this problem, I spent several years studying its true definition.  You can't actually define "life" and all of its potential pitfalls, but you can try. So I have been trying.  Having a healthy fear of general failure, I have on several occasions thought "I need to keep track of things so I don't wake up one day to find I've painted myself in a corner". This was the nagging thought that spurred my Life Tracking System (LTS). The goal of the LTS is to audit my life in the four distinct areas I've determined have the greatest significance or impact. I want to track the following:
Diet - Garbage in, garbage out. What you eat is what you are.
Exercise - If you don't use it, you lose it.
Money - I'm spending how much on what?!?
Demetri - My list of 25 things a "good" person would do every day.
In doing so I hope to gain a greater sense of self, a greater handle on the important things in life, and use this knowledge to make intentional and positive changes in my life. I've tried doing something like this on several occasions in the past. The vast majority of them failed. Using those failures I've figured out what needed to be done for a system to be successful. I sought to make data entry as quick, efficient, and simple as possible. Beyond that, my goal was to have all the data manipulation and summaries performed automatically. 

I nailed it. 

 I have implemented the LTS using a Google Form and Spreadsheet with several associated custom-built scripts. The form is bookmarked and present on my main Android homescreen. It presents a single input interface for all four facets I'm tracking.

![](assets/83-1.png)

Each radio button links to its own section of the form. 

![](assets/83-2.png)

Sample Data Entry Section - Diet

![](assets/83-3.png)

Sample Data Entry Section 2 - Demetri

The data I enter in these screens is added to a spreadsheet. Making sense of the raw spreadsheet is difficult. It has 41 columns and any given row has data in a maximum of 7 of them. It's mostly white space, but the data is there. 

Nexus 7 screenshot showing a difficult to interpret spreadsheet

![](assets/83-4.png)

To remedy this, each time data is entered I have it sorted away automatically via a script I wrote. The script formats and copies the data over to one of the four summary sheets I built to represent each facet. The system works; and I've used it to its fullest extent for the past seven days. This is my life last week: 

![](assets/83-5.png)

![](assets/83-7.png)

This week's portion of this month's spending - I don't know why the total is carried out to 14 digits

![](assets/83-8.png)

Demetri Summary - more productive than the past 16 weeks

I have several other scripts that insert daily, weekly, or monthly summaries of each facet. One sends a summary digest to my email every Monday. Rather than include a screenshot of it I'll just say that it summarizes every day with the number of Demetri goals completed, the dietary summary from each day, and  the number of days I worked out.

That is my system. Those are my goals. This is what I'm doing. That is what I've done. Through my initial results I have already learned a few things. I'll use the Top 5 to outline those things below. 

For completeness I feel like I should include a picture of my Workout/Demetri printout from last week:

![](assets/83-9.jpg)

One piece of paper can last 2 weeks - also my handwriting is atrocious when I'm working out

Thank you for stopping by. I promise my next column won't be so full of business. Probably wedding stuff.

# Top 5: Things I've Learned after a Single Week with the LTS
5. I am capable of eating both a little and a LOT - Sunday: 1880 calories, Friday: 3774 calories
4. The workout routine I built does indeed make me sore
3. I'm overall more productive when I keep my mind busy
2. Soda is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE FOR YOU (fast food, too)
1. Explicitly keeping track of things definitely makes you more aware of instances of failure (eating poorly, not working out, spending unnecessary money, being lazy, etc.)

# Motto: Too Much of a Good Thing is a Great Thing


# Fact: I Already Don't like Color Changes and Addition of the "Fact of the Update".

You may have noticed that it's been a while since my last update. There's a really great reason for that; last Sunday my cousin Joe came up to stay with me for the week while he took some preparatory classes for his medical internship this summer.

It has been an awesome and somewhat crazy week. We have had a fortnight's amount of fun in half the time.

His brother Jon came up Thursday night. Since that time we've had a week's worth of fun in 3 days.

I have a metric buttload of stories from the week, and an equal amount of videos. Rather than write at length about everything we did - I'll just show you:

[editor's note: this video was lost to time]

That's just what I filmed. I didn't really have the intention to make that video until after I realized just how much footage I had. I showed less than 1/50th of the videogame playing footage I took. 

I've determined it takes me about an hour to make each minute of video I make. The above video is around 3 minutes long. I (sadly) took me about 3 hours to cut together how I liked it.

# 3 select stories from the weekend:

## 1 - Baseball and the redhead

On Friday we went to the Royal's game in celebration of Joe's 24th birthday. When we got there, we found our seats well in advance of the game (we didn't bring a truck or tailgating supplies because it was a weak commitment). Long story short, we left out seats for a bit and came back to find they had been stolen by a group of kids. "Kids" in this instance is a group of people between the ages of 18 and 21. 

No big deal, we find another set of seats nearby.

A redheaded kid started to annoy the three of us with his loud antics. He left and came back with a beer. I told my cousins I would take bets on him being underage and, before they could reply, he made a really big show about giving a Driver's License back to his friend. 

To make a somewhat long story short, less than 5 minutes later the kid was pulled out of the stands into the hall by security. He came back and told his friends he was only in trouble for "swearing too much". This turned out to be a lie. Jon was coming back from the restroom and came across the security people telling him if he drank underage he would be thrown out of the game.

## 2 - Dave and Buster's

Joe, Jon, and I went to the Legends for a brief stint of man-shopping. I wasn't buying anything, so I decided to pass the time the same way I do when Melissa goes shopping for clothes - by doing embarrassing things without shame.

I danced. I juggled anything I could find. I pretended I was playing Battlefield in real life (okay, we all kind of did that last thing).

Then we went to Dave and Buster's. It had been a year since I had been there last time. Jon was with me back then, too. We had the same waiter that we had had so long ago. The very fact that we remembered him should go to show just how good he was. He can (and did) recite the whole "V" monologue from "V for Vendetta". It was awesome (again).

Then we played games. I won the most tickets - mostly on account of getting lucky once.

## 3 - Battlefield 3

We played Battlefield 3 every night after coming home from the day's festivities. We played as a team and, in doing so, won a lot.

That was a short story.

## In other news:

Melissa comes home in 17 days.

Joe and Jon jointly taught me a new pen spin. It's nifty, but I'm terrible at it. I can combo it into the one I already have mastered about 5% of the time right now. Here is an example of a good one.

![](assets/93-1.gif)

I put a shirt on just to make this. You're welcome.
I have 2 feature columns half-written right now. One on entellajence and another on tools (such as spell check).

There's a church bell playing "America the Beautiful" outside my window somewhere. I've lived here for almost a year, and I have never heard a bell before.

# Balance

I have been writing fewer Columns lately. Some of the things I used to write about on here have transitioned into my Notes. Below are an excerpts from a few notes that would have been Column topics in years passed.

Of course, the beauty of having a hobby like this is that I owe a new post to exactly nobody. Especially not Nick[^1]. 

# A Sampling of Notes

![[451-1.jpg]]
## [Productivity isn’t Inherently Good](https://www.gillespedia.com/Productivity%20isn’t%20Inherently%20Good)

At some point approaching adulthood you came to the overly simplistic fundamental assumption: ”Productivity is Good”.  
This is true *sometimes*, but **there is nothing inherently good[^2] about productivity**. Sure, if you’re productive, then by definition you produce a result… but results aren’t inherently good. Even "good results" aren't *always* good. 

Does the “productive activity” make you happy?  
Is the result actually necessary?  
Does the result make you happy?  
Does it make the world better?  

When you want to be productive and can’t, then it feels like “productivity is good”, but that ignores the question of **why do you want to be productive in the first place?**

Productivity is bad if:

- you’re not enjoying the process, and the results aren’t outweighing that
- because the results are unnecessary
- because the results are bad
- achieving results that are worth the [3 Personal Resources](https://www.gillespedia.com/3%20Personal%20Resources) you’re using and that result cannot be achieved via more enjoyable

Productivity is good if:

- The results are truly worth the suck
- If the process doesn’t suck and the results are okay

Productivity is great if:

- The results are good, and the process is enjoyable

## [Brutal and Relentless](https://www.gillespedia.com/Brutal%20and%20Relentless)

Person A: “*be kind, everyone is fighting their own battles.*”  
Person B: “why would I be kind? **I will be brutal and relentless and ride into battle by their side**.”

## [Control Your (blank) or Your (black) will Control You](https://www.gillespedia.com/Control%20Blank%20or%20Blank%20Will%20Control%20You)

A surprisingly common turn of phrase that I have come across in my reading is:


> [!tip] Control your *(blank)* or your *(blank)* will control you

Where that blank is filled with:

- Environment - (Willpower Doesn’t Work)
- Computer - ([The Things We Make](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/The%20Things%20We%20Make)
- Calendar - ([Off the Clock](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/Off%20the%20Clock) and/or [Deep Work (book)](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/Deep%20Work%20(book))
- Projects - ([Building a Second Brain](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/Building%20a%20Second%20Brain)

Although I don’t specifically ever seeing these in this context, I feel like several books I’ve read could be summarized in this way:

- Control your money or your money will control you ([Your Money or Your Life](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/Your%20Money%20or%20Your%20Life)
- Control the things you buy or the things you buy will control you ([The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/The%20Life%20Changing%20Magic%20of%20Tidying%20Up)
- Control your commitments or your commitments will control you ([Essentialism](https://www.gillespedia.com/sources/Essentialism)

# Endnotes

I honestly dunno if this sort of Column is at all interesting. After having done the work to copy/paste the above, meh. Maybe I’ll just write about non-noteworthy things.

## Non-Noteworthy Things

The weather is nice. Allergies are not.

Dune 2 was great.

I told a good joke today. The punch line was “You can have Juan, but not the other”. I’ll leave it to your imagination to fill in the run-up. Frankly any setup would work. Dynamite punch line. I had to stop myself from fist-pumping all over the room.



# Top 9: XoX

# Motto: Movin on up.

Since the last update I moved to Kansas City. Since I moved to Kansas City I've spent an inordinate amount of money on rent and furnishings and other general life stuff that I've never had to worry about until I (finally) got my own place. Example: Silverware drawer organizer. Anyways, I'm sitting here on my new chaise sofa, drinking from my old water bottle, writing a new column on my old laptop, watching a new movie on my old TV. 

I like living here. I like living on my own. I have learned a lot already. It's going to be awesome.

I start my job Monday. So, I'm a bit nervous for that. Money, however, I'm not nervous about. I was literally down to zero money to my name, so I'm excited to get that situation fixed.

Rather than droning on forever like normal, I'm going to end it here with a picture of this cute kid I happen to be the uncle of:

![](assets/31-1.jpg)

Top 5: Perks of having your own place
5. I can keep it as clean or dirty as I want (it's very clean)
4. I can sleep anywhere I want (I usually choose the bed)
3. I can set it up however I want (this is here for consistency)
2. I can watch whatever stupid movies I want (currently, Hot Shots: Part Deux)
1. Pants are entirely optional (I never wear any)

# Four Hundred Celebration

This is Column #400[^1]. Some might say "I can't believe I've made it this far", but not me. I enjoy doing it, therefore I haven't stopped. What I *have* done is change my mind several times. The Column has grown and evolved over the past 399 entries. I switched platforms. I changed formats, somewhat. There are a lot of tweaks I want to make to my first 399 posts:

- Changing the URL of each to simply refer to the Column number, not the number & title
- Changing the tags to better reflect what I wound up writing about over the past 8 years
- Cleaning the **garbage** html that Blogger imposed on my stuff
- Fixing broken links (where possible)

There's no time like the present. I'm going to make those tweaks over the next several months. You won't notice. Nobody will appreciate the results of the effort but me... and I'm 100% okay with that. 

# Aaron Talks Politics

I'm going to do something here that I promised myself I'd never do on my blog.

Just for a second. I promise.

As I write this, it's been about 6 hours since Joe Biden has been projected to take over as president of the United States come January 2021. I'll speak for myself *(and I think the majority individuals from all over the world)* when I say **"thank God"**. Thank God not because of any shift in political policies or positions, but because we'll once again have a President that feels beholden to *facts*. We will have a President who doesn't feel entitled to do and say whatever he feels - regardless of objective reality - damned be the consequences. We'll have a President who cares more about the country than his image. One who'd rather *lose* than try to split the country and call into question the results of the election.

Donald Trump *(both the man and the fact that nearly half the country wanted him as President)* shook my worldview in a way I may never fully be able to reconcile. Thank God I get to start trying sooner rather than later.

The last political thing I'll ever say on here *(until I break this promise to myself again)*:   
I followed this election intentionally using a variety of news sources. I used those [attempting-to-be-centrist](https://apnews.com/), to [the liberal-leaning](https://www.msnbc.com/), to [the conservative-leaning](https://www.foxnews.com/)... and I have seen such a different picture of the world painted in each. Worse than that, I've ventured into comment sections and found random internet people treating this amorphous group of "others" from the opposing political party like they are the worst possible people. They regard the other side as some sort of caricature of ignorance and/or malice. This is unapologetically naive, on both sides of the aisle. 

> As we leave the front pages in bed  
> With the war raging on in our heads  
> I could write a swath of humanity off  
> 'cause of something that I just read  
> But I don't want to fight fire with fire  
> And I don't want to preach to the choir  
> Giving just as much hell as I get  
> To people I'd prob'ly like if I met  
> <cite>Chris Thile, in "[I Made This For You](https://genius.com/Chris-thile-i-made-this-for-you-lyrics)"</cite>

Let's all try to see each other's perspective. Seek first to understand, *then* be understood. Donald never came close to this. To be fair to him *(which is something he doesn't deserve)* most political conversations fail to meet this standard. We surround ourselves with facts or analyses thereof that are a subset of the actual reality, which are congruent with our existing perspectives of the world. Conversations between the conservative and the liberal are doomed without a shared understanding that the world the other person sees is quite likely very different from the world as they see it. Moreover, how you feel about hot-button issues is more often than not dictated by your gut, rather than your brain. Reasoned arguments don't have a chance to get everyone to meet each other on common ground. Empathy does.

# Life Update for Posterity

I am now the father of two. My little guy has an even *littler* guy to call his brother. Now I've got two little guys and a beautiful woman that I am lucky enough to have in my life. And my two cats are okay.

I'm working to seek the new balance going forward. I mean that both philosophically and also in terms of *shoes*, because I'm a dad twice-over now and I think New Balance shoes are part of that uniform..

# Top 5: Longest Running Personal Projects of Mine
## 5. Gillespedia & my Notes database
The first note from my (public) Notion "Notes" database was created on 3/3/2020. It spun up from a different project which split out into a public Notion database full of atomic notes about various topics, and the [Gillespedia](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia) section of this blog. Gillespedia has grown to 12 entries (behind where I'd like it to be, admittedly) whereas the Notes database just crossed over 450 interconnected notes (about on par with where I'd like it).

![notes](assets/400-1.png)

See the 30 Day Challenge "Atomize & Transition Gillespedia" from April 2020, where I started this project.

## 4. 30 Day Challenges
The first 30 Day Challenge I undertook was a "bulking" challenge in October 2013. After that, I took a couple months off. Since January 2014 I've had a new challenge[^2] every month[^3] that have added variety and opportunity into my life.

![](assets/400-2.png)

See the Data Journal entry for 1/1/2014 where I wrote "Started a Paleo(ish) diet" and started this project.
## 3. The ~~Life Tracker~~ Data Journal
The first row from my Data Journal is from April 22nd, 2013. It's a unified journal, with a (non-exclusive) focus on quantified-self data. For the first few years of tracking it was sensitive to missing data. Since 6/22/2015 I haven't missed a day of tracking at least *some* data. 

![](assets/400-3.png)

See Second-a-Day video clip for [April 3rd, 2013](https://youtu.be/8_AwZQKjplc)?t=310) in which you see me writing code for this project.
## 2. Second-A-Day Videos
The first shot from my first Second-a-Day video was 8/1/2012. Since that time, I've captured and spliced together one second from each of the next 2,929 days into a series of YouTube videos.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

See [Column #23](https://aarongilly.com/23) in which I wrote for the first time about starting this project.
## 1. This Blog

![](assets/400-4.png)

While that histogram is clearly left-skewed, there's no total drop-off. Also having gone back and reviewed a lot of my prior work, the lower frequency from the past few years ties to higher quality. The Column, like everything else in my life lately, is tuned into one of my prime philosophies: **Less, but Better**.  

Notice how each of those Projects is referenced in the one that came before it? That's [synergy](https://www.notion.so/Synergize-4bf628f94eef4fa4939ce4730c38eb20).

# Quotes
> An expert is a person who has found out by painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field. <cite>Niels Bohr</cite>

[^1]: This is actually closer to Column #1000 than 400, but the first many hundred Columns I've written in my life are (gratefully) lost to time. They were the incoherent ramblings of a boy. These are the incoherent ramblings of a man.

[^2]: Technically I've done some challenges twice - a bulking challenge, a "Digital Minimalism" challenge, etc. 

[^3]: This is also false. In 2016 I attempted to do 12 different challenge all year instead of rotating one a month each month (that failed) and in 2018 I held a "30 Day Challenge" of "[No Zero](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiw-tKh0MjsAhVNZc0KHRQBAmoQFjAAegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fgetdisciplined%2Fcomments%2F1q96b5%2Fi_just_dont_care_about_myself%2Fcdah4af%2F&usg=AOvVaw34kr1z45KNWoqXDfsZGz5Z)" out for the majority of the year before starting unique challenges again in January 2019.

# Motto: 6 Months Down, Six Months to Go

I have a lot of time to kill before I can put a wrap on this post. I just started the render for the updated version of my second-a-day video. This post is being created specifically to showcase the video because, as of this writing, I am exactly 24 1/2 years old... which means my video is exactly half finished. In an hour and twenty minutes, I'll upload it to YouTube. When that upload gets done (probably another hour, at least) I will put the video right below this line. For you, it's been there this whole time.

(this video lost to time)

This has truly been the longest I've ever worked on some project that was "just for fun". Unless you count skateboarding. I did that for 7 years. Some people are professional skateboarders after 2 years. Took me 7 to get somewhat competent. Skateboarding, though, is what introduced me to making videos. As you may know, all real skateboarders have to be on camera so they can be seen skateboarding; otherwise, what's the point, right? Putting together my first skateboard video started a chain of events that eventually led me to filming something every day for a year. This project was a relatively large undertaking when I started it. I didn't honestly think I'd be able to keep it up. But I have, and I'm glad. It's one of my favorite things I've ever made.

I think that video works best for me. Other people might like it... but I'm the only person who knows the other people in it, who went through the events documented, who has the memories. Everyone should do something like this. It's fantastic what you do in half a year.

I will now provide an very incomplete list of some comments for some of these seconds:

In other news, I had a highly productive day and I celebrated by eating a whole Digiorno pizza.

Did you catch my movie/tv show/song/book reference? I like hiding these things in plain sight. If you didn't spot it, this link is to YouTube and should give you the answer.

Because I want a picture to show up on the mobile version of the column, I need to post one. Here's the picture I sent to Melissa when I first tried on my usher's shirt and tie for Amy's wedding:

# Motto: 364 days until Christmas!

I'm writing you this right now from the couch in the living room in my parent's house, laying on my back, using my tablet. Christmas was technically yesterday, but I haven't went to sleep yet. The whole presents thing happened roughly 14 hours ago. All-in-all, of was a great time. I was very happy I got to spend some time with the family. Also - I got to spend some time with my girlfriend's family; which is very important to me as well. In both instances, card games, boards games, and good food was had all the way around. 

Also, I got paid just the same amount as I'd I had went to work.

You really can't ask for a better time than that. It was perfect.

The point of view of the Catan grand champion
Some other things I've been thinking about lately:
8.53792 = Pie ... because ... 3.14159 * 2.71828 = 8.53792
The column is fantastic because it let's me share a diverse set of creative output. This includes, but is not limited to, thoughts, stories, research, pictures, drawings, video, audio, poetry, jokes, and/or whatever else I can think of. It's a great catch-all.
I was shown by my lovely girlfriend how the "tags" feature works on Blogger... So I might go through and tag my old posts and all future posts if they include any of the things mentioned in the last bullet point.
I have been considering a change to a MonoScript font for the column. There's some nerd-appeal to it for me.
Life is good.


# Top 5: Christmas Moments
5. Hanging out with Melissa's family. I enjoy their family dynamic as a great supplement to my own. They are good fun.
4. Getting presents - let's be honest here.
3. When I won my first and second games of Settlers of Catan ever. 
2. Learning and playing several new games - Backseat Drawing, Scattergories Categories, and Buzz Word.
1. When my sister, whose never played poker before in her life, beat 5 very competitive people who've played a fair amount of poker in the past.

Posts have been getting pretty long lately. Surely this one about the philosophy of happiness and productivity will be short. 

# “The Perfect Day”

There is no such thing as the perfect day. 

So much of the past decade plus of my life has been spent in pursuit of maximizing my own life satisfaction[^1]. Nothing is as satisfying as “the perfect day”, so I've made probably **dozens** of attempts at laying out what “the perfect” day would look like.

## Excerpt from the Perfect Day

Perfect morning routine. Wake up early. Glass of cold water. An hour of self-work, sharpen that saw. Healthy breakfast. Identify and prioritize plans and goals for the day. Do the hardest most important thing first. Finish before lunch. Take dedicated breaks. Task batching. Decomposing long term ambitions into perfectly aligned bite sized plans. Minimum viable progress using the 2 minute rule. Walks outside with a friend to recharge your batteries. Leave the office at the office and come home somehow more energized even than when you left. Talk with your loved ones while you prepare a healthy dinner. Eat. Play. Laugh. Create. Consume. Put the kids to bed. Read a book. Meditate. Reflect. Focus on your gratitudes. Drink some tea. To bed early and easy.

Turns out it was futile.

There isn't a day where you can flow perfectly from one thing to the next seemingly without effort, overjoyed while you accomplish all of your biggest goals and aspirations while simultaneously experiencing zen. That's just not how life works. You can't plan that. You can't force it into existence. 

There is no such thing as **the** perfect day. 

# There are **tons** of perfect days.

“THE” perfect day implies that there is only one. There absolutely is not. If you were to find “THE” perfect day, and relive it for the rest of your life (not like “groundhogs day”, but more like make the same routine happen), you'd end up missing out on life. You'd hate it. 

Perfect days aren't an even split of all the things you want to do, sectioned out into neat 15 minute segments. [I've lamented about the 10,000 minutes we get each week not feeling long enough](http://aarongilly.com/418/), well when you wind that down to the 1440 minutes you get **today**… there really isn't enough time to go around. 

You get done what you get done. You don't what you don't. Like isn't about jamming out as many productive things as humanly possible. It's about enjoying your time here. Being productive can be very enjoyable, but it's more important to **enjoy** the process than it is to **complete** the process.

When I reach my death bed, I'm not going to wish for one last day to make great content and dazzle my fictional readers, or have the cleanest house there ever was, or code the next new hotness at work or for fun... I'm going to wish for a day where I could sit with my wife and watch my kids play in the lawn. Or a day where I could go for a jog and simply observe my surroundings. Or share a laugh at an inappropriately timed fart. 

## I have lived many perfect days.

The day I made a friend. The day I fell in love. The births of my sons. The trips I’ve taken to lands afar. The support of family when the unexpected happened. My wedding. Simply playing video games on the couch with the closest things to brothers I ever had. The day I bought a house. The day I sold a house. When I got a job. When I felt like I made a difference. When I drank the best drinks and ate the best food. The unveiling of my first Second-a-Day video. The numerous Christmases and holidays. A random Tuesday where I got to exercise and realized I had a free evening. The day I watched The Avengers in theaters. The first “good” podcast episode we made. The day my puzzle box debuted. When I figured out the OAuth2 process for my Life Tracker. The first day after my worst flare up resolved. My graduation. My engagement. The day we got a puppy when I was a kid. Numerous days my parents killed themselves for that I had no chance of remembering because I was a toddler. The night where we got family photos and the weather was perfect. The times where Melissa and I are perfectly in sync, doing something as seemingly monotonous as preparing dinner, but flowing through it. When my son danced to the auto-play function on our keyboard. The banner picture I use in most of these Columns, that was a perfect day.

![Image of Melissa and Grif](assets/434-1.jpg)

Right now where I'm sitting with a cat on my lap, in my sons bedroom waiting for him to fall asleep. 

This is perfect.  



# Top 5: Themes in a Perfect Day



## 5. Go with the flow

Fighting natural inclinations rarely leads to a feeling of contentment. I'm writing this right now because I felt like it. Is it what I “should” be doing right now? Nah.



## 4. Move your body

It's what it was designed to do. If you can move it, you were given God’s greatest blessing. Use the tools you've been given for the things they were meant for. 



## 3. Seize the moment

You regret more what you didn't do than what you've done. If an opportunity for adventure presents itself, usually you should take it. 



## 2. Share them with other people

Humans are biologically wired to be social creatures. Connection to others is vital. Many would argue that's the whole point of it all.



## 1. Think more about what you're experiencing right now and less about what you “have” to do later

We spend our whole lives in the present. Don't spend too much of your daily 1440 hours thinking about what needs to get done tomorrow.



# **Quote:**



> Any day you can take a s*** is a good day.
<cite>Comedian Chris Hardwick’s dad’s life lesson</cite>

[^1]: This sounds selfish, but I'd argue the philosophy that everyone is doing this all the time. They may be less intentional about it, but I think human motivation is directly tied into satisfaction. Be it a dopamine hit from some piece of candy or the satisfaction from having the moral resolve to resist it.

I'm relieved - but **not thrilled** - to be writing this.

# Prelude

I start grad school in a few weeks. Right as a new year begins, I'll add a large new rock to my bag of responsibilities and demand on my time. I have been worried about managing it. Worse, my system for *managing* things has not been what I hoped it would be.

Lately as I've struggled to use the Personal Data Warehouse & Data Journal system **I just spent literal months re-writing** I've found myself questioning "*why am I even using this at all?*". I was putting data in, but never really pulling value back out. I thought about *stopping*, but the thought of not keeping track of things scared me for the same [[76|reasons I started]] in the first place.

So - literally **one Column** after having written about my problem with building systems, I find myself writing about a system I built. Irony? Hypocrisy? Idiocy? All of the above?

# The Data Journal is Dead

The thing I spent 100s of hours over the past 4 years building, writing about, drawing diagrams for, documenting, and rethinking is dead. I'm not using it. I don't plan to use it any more. This is the last time I plan to write about it directly.[^1]

All of the variants & releases, the blog posts & pages, the diagrams & documentation, the models & artifacts, and the ad hoc data files, all of that has, as of this moment, become irrelevant - a relic of the past from a long and extraordinarily complicated experiment/period of my life.

The system I built was too complicated. So I killed it and started again. The "simpler" thing I built was *still* too complicated, so I killed it and started again, *again*.

# Long Live the Data Journal

I built my new system in a **day**. My new system is *essentially* just my spreadsheet from 4 1/2 years ago, with minor tweaks. It's so much **less impressive** than the things I've built over the preceding 4 years, but it's better.

![[465-2.png]]

I won't go into details of how it works here - because I just wrote [[Data Journal|this page to describe it in detail]].

# Epilogue: Mastery

Do I regret building all that stuff I am not going to use? Not at all. I learned an **immense** amount - about little techniques, gigantic concepts, and about myself.[^2] [Mastery is knowing what you actually need](https://gillespedia.com/Mastery+is+Knowing+What+You+Actually+Need). I feel like I well and truly reached the final stage of maturity on this. The end of the bell curve:

![[465-1.png]]

# Top 5: Things I Designed the Data Journal (v11) to Do

My design principle going into this build was to identify the **very few** things the system actually *has* to do, then write the **least amount of code possible** to make those things happen.

## 5. Store data for multiple levels of granularity

Some data are day-long, like `total sleep`, for example. Other data are *year* long, like `days spent travelling`. Yet other data may happen more often than once per day, like `movies watched`. My approach is to have one sheet per level of granularity from years to days, then have independent sheets for the few other things I'd like to track multiple times per day.

## 4. Allow posting **new** data for **today** via a REST call

Creating an HTTP POST request to my webapp's URL and supplying two parameters *(what data to put in, and which sheet to put it in)* will add those data in the correct spot.

## 3. Allow retrieving *today's* data via a REST call

Simply navigating to my webapp's URL will fetch the data for **today** from all the sheets, then respond with them in a sensible JSON format.

## 2. Create new row(s) every night

Google Apps Script lets you trigger code execution on a schedule. Each day a new row is added to my "Days" sheet. On Mondays I get a new row in the "Weeks" sheet. Etc.

## 1. Function like a normal spreadsheet

I am not writing my own highly-specialized magical functions & calling them from within the workbook. The spreadsheet is a spreadsheet. It's doing what regular spreadsheets do, using regular relatively simple spreadsheet functions.

Motto: If you are listless, you lack energy or enthusiasm. Prepare for energy and enthusiasm.

  
There are several different ways people refer to me:

* Tall guy
* Goofy guy
* Really tall guy

But nobody ever says:

* Handsome guy
* Mr. Macho
* The Listmaker

... which is a shame. At least one of the three of those is dead-on accurate.

  
This Column is full of lists. Some of these lists will be from previous Columns, but I wanted to be thorough. Here's a list of the lists that you'll find if you decide to keep reading:

* Ways people tend to refer to me
* Ways people _should_ refer to me
* List of lists
* Big wedding details that Melissa and I have already taken care of
* List of television shows of which I've seen every episode
* List of phones I've owned
* List of consumer products I endorse
* List of the contents of my messenger bag
* Top 15: Life Pro Tips

Melissa and I have finally reached the point where I feel comfortable saying "we've got pretty much all the big stuff taken care of when it comes to our wedding." While we are still a long ways from done (we've got a lot to do in the next month), we can at least say we've taken care of the following:We've got all the biggest wedding details done. This includes:

* Date
* Time
* Wedding site
* Reception site
* Photographer
* Officiant
* Dress
* Tuxes
* Bridesmaids dresses
* Bridesmaids & groomsmen
* Immediate family outfits
* Rental crap
* Caterer
* Band
* Hotel
* Photobooth
* Party bus
* Cake
* Floral
* Makeup
* Hair (different from makeup somehow)
* Rings
* Honeymoon
* Flights
* Invitations
* RVSPs
* Save the Dates
* Website

There won't be many segways between these lists. I don't know how to transition from wedding details to television shows gracefully. Gracefully. _Will & Grace_. Here's a list of television shows of which I've seen every episode:

* _NOT_ Will & Grace - I just wanted to make that clear
* Scrubs
* Lost
* Breaking Bad
* Family Guy\*
* Futurama
* Modern Family\*
* Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\*
* Parks & Recreation\*
* The Office
* Brooklyn Nine-Nine\*
* Community\*

\* The six shows denoted with an asterisk are currently in production - but I've still seen every episode of them. I didn't realize I'm keeping current on 6 different shows. That seems excessive.

  
I have owned the following phones (listed from oldest to newest):

* Unnamed Motorola flip phone
* Motorola Droid
* HTZ Rezound (for 2 weeks)
* Galaxy Nexus
* Nexus 4
* Nexus 5

The following is a list of consumer products that I, Aaron Gillespie, publicly endorse:

  
* Nalgene
* Timbuk2 Bags
* Leatherman Multitools
* Casio G-Shock Watches
* Converse Shoes
* Papermate Flair Pens
* Moleskine Notebooks
* Google Services (all)
* Nexus Phones
* Boulevard Wheat Beer
* Rubber Duckies, any brand
* GoPro Cameras
* Pelican Cases
* KeePass & TrueCrypt Programs
* Dominion

That was basically the entirety of Column #142\. Thanks for rereading that.

  
The following is a complete list of the contents of my messenger bag (before I sat down at this table):

* Black Moleskine notebook
* Black Papermate Flair pen
* Black Sharpie
* Black Kensington 8GB flash drive
* Black Nexus 4 earbuds (these are a thing)
* Black earbud bag
* Black external batter/laser pointer
* My work ID
* Short microUSB cable (tied with gear tie)
* Long microUSB cable (tied with gear tie)
* USB outlet base
* Timbuk2 cross strap (tied with gear tie)
* Spare gear tie
* Nalgene
* Eye drops
* Cuticle nippers
* Toshiba Chromebook
* Streamlight flashlight
* Leatherman Fuse mutlitool
* And, because I'm not wearing shorts with pockets - my phone, wallet, & keys

That's enough. Here's the picture to go out on - secret extra list! (this list is out of date)

Nearly everyone in the United States has a **huge** opportunity right now.

# COVID-19

I've heard COVID-19 is "like a long, slow September 11th, 2001". I think that equating the two is disrespectful, but I understand the point. There was a "before", there will be an "after", and those two realities are not going to be the same.

![[389-1.jpg]]

My heart goes out to everyone. Those who have the virus, those who are taking care of someone with it, those who are stepping up in our hospitals and help centers around the country, and those whose livelihoods have been so affected. I wonder about the long-lasting implications of this time. Not only because the entire world will have been effected by a virus, but also because of what realizations dawn on everyone as individuals. Maybe some good will come out of this?
Maybe being "stuck at home" wasn't really so bad? Maybe you look at your credit card statement in a month and say "huh, turns out if we are at home we don't spend *anything*."  
Maybe you realize doing Facetime with your family is actually pretty *easy*, then you wind up spending more quality time together than you did before.  
Maybe working from home makes you realize that you simultaneously hate your commute and get more quality work done from home anyway.
Maybe people wash their hands. Maybe.

I'm no economist. I'm no philosopher. I'm not read into socioeconomic trends. I'm a casual observer of society at best... but it has felt to me like we (collectively) have been trying to live "more, more, more" for so long - that a not insignificant portion of the population will stand to benefit from having this heavy weight tied around our collective ankles. I hope we learn to make more with less; to look deeper, not broader. I hope this terrible tragedy for so many can bring about realizations of great meaning for many more.

With the hours in your day, what are you doing? Are you pursuing something that you've always wanted to do, but haven't "had the time"? Are you hugging those vital few people you can? Are you calling your parents? Or are you digging through the backlogs of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, YouTube, and whatever else may have something to numb the mind until this period passes.

I for one am not going to let this time go to waste. I'm going to work harder and love deeper than ever before.

# What Aaron is Doing

I'm happy to say this post is not aspirational. This post takes place two weeks into the Pandemic because I've been busy *already doing* these things.

## Family

![[389-2.jpg]]

I am staying at home with my wife and son. I am doing my absolute best to spend as much quality time with them as possible. This is a very cool, definitely very brief and awesome time in our lives.
My wife and I are young, healthy, and happy to be working on fulfilling projects in the same room as each other. We did a puzzle, and had a good time doing it. We take turns (informally) enabling the other to work deeply on something important to us. We are watching a show, true, but not letting that show consume our lives. Tiger King only has 7 episodes anyway. She's helping me learn guitar. We're working on a video project together (more on that later).
My kid is healthy, happy, awesome, and at a really fun age. He's got independence, but still wants to be around us. He's got words, but still asks for help opening the jar of pretzels. He's young enough to let me work in the office, but old enough to realize when I pop downstairs that he's missed me. He's growing and learning new thing every single day. We think he may have said his first sentence today - he told his mom that dad was in the potty. Good deal.

## Studying

![[389-3.png]]

I've been learning a ton. I'm very much interested in becoming more and more fluent with JavaScript. I'm working toward becoming a full-stack web developer. This overlaps with my job nicely, but is something I'd be doing for fun if it didn't. I'm about halfway through the curricula at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I'm actively looking at creating a Data Journal that's not got Google Sheets as its backend. This morning [I played around](https://quartz-nut-qcttcoafkb.glitch.me/) with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). I'm going to keep doing that after I'm done with this. I assume that my webpage link there will break at some point. There's not much to see anyway.

## Writing

![[assets/9722013872b64150f1afb90f5a0d32dc_MD5.png]]

My 30 Day Challenge for April is to finish transitioning [Gillespedia](http://gillespedia.com) from what it was to what it will be: a part of this website. 

Gillespedia was an idea I had about a year ago, which was an extension of an idea I had right after I graduated college *(nearly a decade ago, maybe I'm not so young?)* At that point I wanted to do a comprehensive review of everything I ever learned in school, rewriting it in my own words. I was scared I'd forget it all. Well, for a lot of it I have. But I lost motivation, because I wasn't learning *new* things - just summarizing old ones. Also I got a job and other priorities started coming up. 

After I became a father, I got renewed interest in the idea of repackaging the contents of my brain in some way that could be passed onto my son (or whoever else might want it). This time, though, I wouldn't try to do a shotgun all-at-once approach. I'd write about topics on an adhoc basis. If something was interested and warranted more research, I'd do that. This is the basis for what I've been working on in Notion for the past 10+ months.

Long story short, I decided to build a "second brain" for my permanent notes. I'm currently summarizing my own summaries of books I've read. I plan to transition the (worthwhile) book reviews to Gillespedia, and to move my original works over as well. It will live, at least for the foreseeable future, in this website via the link at the top. Also at [Gillespedia.com](http://gillespedia.com).

## Art

![[389-4.jpg]]

I've been learning the guitar for the past two months. Just recently I got over a plateau and it genuinely started to become fun. This is a very exciting thing for me. I wanted to prove to myself that I could utilize my own best practices to accomplish something I've always found difficult. I'd like to think I've already done it - what's important now is that I'm having fun developing some pinch of competence.

Also Melissa and I are working on a video project to document just how much fun the Gillespies had over quarantine. That will be on here eventually. We're still just getting started, unfortunately.

## Exercise

![[389-5.jpg]]

Oh, and my half-planned half-randomly-assigned exercise scheme has continued to be satisfying. I'm getting stronger and leaner than ever before. I mean, I **am** those things. It's weird looking in the mirror.

# Top 5: Resources to Help You Use This Time

1. Make art. Got a pencil & paper? Draw! Got an instrument? There's a ton of ways to practice in your jammies. I've been using [Yousician](https://yousician.com/) on my iPhone pretty successfully for the past two months. Only paid for the premium version just now, because I realized it was worth it to me.
2. Learn anything you want buy auditing free courses from [Udemy](http://udemy.com), or going down YouTube rabbit holes.
3. Take up a hobby of writing. If you have a journal, use it! If you don't, you don't need one. I've been keeping an incredibly extensive journal for the past 2500 days in Google Spreadsheets. You can use anything.
4. Learn to code. Costs nothing. A ton of resources. I have used a lot, but [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is all you need. If not that, [Udacity](http://udacity.com). Or Udemy. Or [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Or [Lynda](http://lynda.com). There's so many options.
5. Check your local library's website. Find their app [[Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), [Axis 360](http://axis360.site.baker-taylor.com/), [RbDigital](https://rbdigital.com/)]. Use it. I just signed up for a Library Card for the KC Library from this desk with Libby. For free. Took 1 minute.

My fear is that I'll look back on this as the best time of my life, and there will (hopefully) never be another reason to be shut in for weeks again.

Motto: WHOA IS ME!

  
This Column will have some of the same old stuff I usually talk about presented in the same old ways. It will also have some different new stuff that I'll be saying about the same old stuff. Be prepared to hear about Google, GoPros, and Marvel - along with maybe some other stuff along the way.

  
This first part is a bit of a downer - fair warning.

  
Overall I'm not impressed with consumer tech any more. I'm not saying I think it's "for granted" that we carry around this amazing device in our pockets that is capable of doing more than the collective capabilities of a nerd from the early-90's entire electronics collection. I'm saying that we reached "peak phone" somewhere around 2014\. The first time someone made a phone that had a screen that was bigger than 4.5 inches, with a decent camera. Ever since then each successive phone has been a minor iteration of the already amazing foundation laid by its predecessors. There have been some "nice" features - notably fingerprint sensors have been a nice addition - but nothing that really gets me excited.

  
We've narrowed down what a "smartphone" should be. No phone nowadays is meaningfully different than any other. Even the line between iPhone and Android as a whole has become so blurred from their mutual feature stealing/user interface copying. Granted, they are still just different shades of _awesome_.

  
I listen to multiple tech podcasts - but I find myself becoming less and less interested because they have less and less to say. The new iPhone is out and it's most note-worthy features is its LACK of a feature. Google's next "Nexus" phone is being announced October 4th - a fact that I only know because some other people cared enough to bring it up. My Nexus 6P is plenty good. Google would have to come WAY out of left field to do anything with their upcoming "pixel" phone that would make me consider making the upgrade - a thing that I used to just consider "a given" for a person of my interests.

  
Furthermore, with respect to just GOOGLE for a minute, here, their hit/miss ratio has been going in the TUBES over the past few years. I used to use literally every app, platform, and feature that Google offered. YouTube, Android, Google Search, Gmail, Google Docs... how can only ONE company make so many awesome things? Possibly because they make so MUCH nowadays. As they have expanded, it's become impractical to use _all_ of their stuff... but it doesn't matter because much of it is half-baked, questionably useful, or already has well-entrenched, better options available... usually _made by Google itself!_

I'm tired of complaining - so, for a bit more on what I'm talking about, see the Top 5\. Until then, it's happy fun thoughts!

  
I think the next big "revolution" is going to be augmented reality. Not some goofy headset that you wear that separate you from the world you live in - but a device that blends the real world and the digital world seamlessly. A thing that can replace your phone, because it does all the same stuff & does it better. I don't need to carry a physical thing in my pocket that I have to carry around. I want the user interface in my vision. I want the Iron Man interface, with a Jarvis to boot. The day we can do everything we do on a phone on a device that looks & feels like a pair of ordinary glasses. 

  
Owning a lawn means you get a lot more chigger & mosquito bites.

  
GoPros are a thing that haven't really improved all that much since the GoPro Hero 3 Silver I bought a long time ago (the one that Nick lost in a river). My Hero 3+ Black was a minor improvement over the 3 Silver that Nick lost (and subsequently made up for in spades... don't tell him but Nick is one of my favorite people in the world). The Hero 4 came out, and I didn't really give it much serious thought.

  
That _was_ the case until they announced the Hero 5 & Hero 5 Session yesterday. I'm impressed with the actual value-add features they've put into this year's model. Most notably, they removed the need for a case if you're going in the water! That means you don't have to choose between sound & water-proofness. You don't really have to worry about accidentally forgetting you have the non-waterproof back on your camera and ruining it. They also added a touchscreen on the back, and purportedly did so while _increasing_ the battery life? What? They are also pushing their video stabilization as a new killer feature... time will tell on this one. The addition of the GPS, voice control, and overhauled user interface are also nice perks.

  
While I don't think the improvements made to this year's GoPro warrant the purchase of my 3rd GoPro - they DO seem to be good enough for me to suggest "maybe get the newest one" to anyone looking to buy a GoPro. 

  
This Column is longer than I meant to write, and I don't have the time to make it shorter, so I'm going to keep my next piece about Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. shorter than I originally planned.

  
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 4 premiered this week. I was sorta looking forward to it, but not nearly as much as last year. I wasn't too sold on this "Ghost Rider that's not _really_ the _official_ 'Ghost Rider' but still has most of his traits" thing... but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the first episode. It was pretty good! I hope this season is coherent & that the show remains entertaining. Oh, and Ghost Rider looked pretty cool, actually!

  
Picture to go out on - literally my first interaction with the Google Assistant in its new "Allo" messenger:

[![](assets/298-1.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NE3FjpOmp-E/V-STOoU8buI/AAAAAAACcPA/gyPVsf1c2CItAMQSVQKT1ucDQJE1zeGhwCKgB/s1600/Screenshot%5F20160921-213340.png)

  
Top 5: Google Messaging Platforms, in Chronological Order

5\. Google Chat - a great, inter-operable messenger service that was all the places Google was! AKA dead.   
4\. Hangouts - [one place to handle all your messaging needs](https://xkcd.com/927/)! AKA the thing that Google is slowly stripping of features, never really worked all that reliably for many people, and continually crashed my as-pure-and-up-to-date-as-possible phone.  
3\. Messenger - Google's primary SMS app! AKA a pretty solid SMS app that Google itself recommended using over Hangouts.  
2\. Duo videochat - a stupid-simple video messaging app! AKA Facetime! Or just one small part of Hangouts, but with the best features removed!  
1\. Allo messenger - a messaging app with Google Assistant built right in! AKA the messaging app that I installed, just to look at, then **texted** my friends about saying "yeah I'm not going to recommend that we all jump on board this new thing."

0\. Google's eventual RTC client... maybe _that_ will be the good one?

# Motto: The Horse is Never Dead

I love technology. People who know me know this. I get asked about different tech-related things fairly often (which I love, please never stop asking) and my advice always changes with the current technological landscape. This column is about one of my oldest and most consistently-given pieces of advice:

**If at all possible, don't mix technological ecosystems.**

Here's what I mean by that:

*Don't try to sync your Android phone with iTunes running on your Windows 7 computer, don't try to make your Chromebook play well with Microsoft Word, and please God don't try to run Google Docs on Internet Explorer with your Macbook.*

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTUUUURE! (THIS BIT WAS ADDED IN 2021) - the above paragraph echos through my mind when I look around. I am the guy I wrote about. It's no bueno. END EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE.

In general, each of the three biggest software competitors offers its own solution for just about everything you need. Here's what I'm talking about -

![grid](assets/109-1.png)

So, who should you choose? I've already written about this in [Column #44]({{siteurl}}/44), but it was crazy long.

**Apple Pros:**
Apple provides a unique opportunity to stay within an ecosystem on both the hardware and software side of things. They have the perfect mix of simplicity and complexity. They are beautiful, integrated, and optimized. That's their appeal.

**Apple Cons:**
Apple products are expensive.

**Living 100% within Apple:**
If you have the money, it's easy to see how you could live solely within Apple's ecosystem. Buy a Macbook Air, iPad Mini, and iPhone 5. Use iTunes & iCloud. That's it. You're set.

**Google Pros:**
Google is universal. Google is simple. Google is affordable, yet nearly fully-featured.

**Google Cons:**
Google is weak when it comes to offline services, multimedia creation, and that's about it.

**Living 100% within Google:**
Buy the Samsung Chromebook, New Nexus 7, and a Moto X. Use Google Docs and Drive with ChromeOS. Unfortunately, you won't be able to create any serious photos, videos, or music without some other system. I'm waiting on Google to make something like Apple's iLife. Maybe someday.

**Microsoft Pros:**
Microsoft has everything.

**Microsoft Cons:**
Microsoft has everything, and has done a terrible job of integrating it. It's products and services exist under half a dozen different brands and don't work well together.

**Living 100% within Microsoft:**
Buy an Xbox, a PC from a random manufacturer, get a Windows Phone and live to regret all your terrible decisions you sadist.

That's all for that.

If it weren't for Android development, data encryption, and video editing I'd sell this laptop in a heartbeat for a Chromebook and some change.

Then again, I forgot how capable the Nexus 7 is. I just grabbed mine and swiped Melissa's bluetooth keyboard for a second to write this paragraph. It works just as well.


# Top 5: Hard-to-Believe Facts (from Reddit)

5. The last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed. 
4. If you multiplied the number of fingers on the left hand of every person in the world, (i.e. 5 * 5 * 5 *....) you would get 0.
3. Maine is the closest state to Africa.
2. Water does not conduct electricity.

Motto: the Approval of Random Internet Strangers

  
Three months ago, I put this video on YouTube:  
  
  
Up until 14 hours ago, that video had been watched 232 times. In the past 14 hours, it has been seen 21,378 times.   
  
The top post on Reddit this morning was a guy who made a similar but different video. The top comment to that post was another guy who said he had attempted something like that a few months back, but ultimately failed because his life "wasn't interesting enough". The top comment in response to that was me, saying I attempted something like that a year ago, and doing so _makes_ _your life interesting_. I posted a link, then forgot about it until after lunch. When I saw the response it was getting, my jaw dropped. Most of my day today has been spent reading comments and generally feeling good about myself.  
  
Since I started writing this post, that video has been watched an additional 144 times. That's gross.  
  
No, that's **a** gross. Yeah.  

  
In other, more important news...

  
Melissa and I had engagement photos taken this weekend by [our future wedding photographers](http://www.gracenotephotography.com/). They gave us a preview of what's to come:

We're excited. Also - cute.

  
Top 5: Consistent Themes from the new Comments about My Video

5\. People mistook me as having some official offiliation with Google (be that an employee, or spokesperson, or some other role)  
4\. People were interested in the Demetri List and wanted a copy for themselves  
3\. People thought my fiance was beautiful - people were right  
2\. People wanted to make a video just like it  
1\. People approved. There was only one negative comment the whole day. Keeping in mind this is the _internet,_ that's got to be some sort of a record.

Motto: Open is as Open Does

  
This Column is about computer stuff. It is going to have not 1, not 2, not 6, but 5 Top 5's. I own three laptops:   
1. A 6 year old dinosaur which was unearthed and given new life like Frankenstein's monster by way of Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux). I use this machine as a media server.
2. A 3 year old machine running Windows 7\. It was what you'd consider "my only computer" for quite some time... but nowadays I only really use it for media editing and file management.
3. A 6 month old Chromebook that I use the most often. It's my fastest browser.
  
[![](assets/178-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VFMutTn1eMQ/U6bqwuHf2RI/AAAAAAABYpo/MRWFsA%5FTw2g/s1600/%23178+-+Computers.jpg)

That's what I **do** have. It's not what I'd **like** to have. What I'd LIKE to have is a monster desktop machine on which I store all my files, perform all my video & media work, manage all my devices, and maybe even play some games. I'd like to use it kind of like a personal cloud for Melissa and myself. Then we could do most of our daily computing on lightweight reach devices - each tying in to our main storage repository. I could easily do that... but it would take money. Then what would I do with laptops 1 & 2? So, I'm going to do the rare thing and make due with what I have. I'm running out of storage space, though. Also, "what I have" is still a Microsoft product, and I long ago decided to abandon their platform as soon as was convenient. I'd like to go full-blown Linux... but that's easier said than done. It's a big of a double-edged sword. **Top 5: Pros of going Linux-Only**5\. Linux is free. Almost everything about Linux is free to install and play around with. 4\. You can customize everything about everything, just to your liking. 3\. Most everything you'd like to do on a computer, you can find an Open Source, free version of. Want to Photoshop something? Try GIMP. It's free! 2\. Using Linux makes you a smarter, more computer-savy person. 1\. Linux can be super dooper fast. You can blaze through a workflow for almost anything you want to do in a very expedient manner. You can easily create scripts to automate stuff. If you're a developer **Top 5: Cons of going Linux-Only**5\. Linux is free. Money is a strong motivating factor for developers and, as such, many Linux distros are unstable when compared to Apple or Microsoft's operating systems. 4\. You can customize everything about everything, and get stuff really really hopelessly screwed up. 3\. Most everything you'd like to do on a computer, you will have a slightly more cumbersome time accomplishing with Open Source software. Proprietary solutions tend to be more streamlined and capable than Open Source ones... see #5 of this Top 5 for the reason. 2\. Using Linux FORCES you to be a smarter, more computer-savy person because it's challenging in every corner. 1\. Linux can be super dooper fast **if** you put in the work to make it that way. If you don't know what you are doing, it's super dooper slow. If you know how to run a Windows machine, you may have trouble picking up a Macintosh. Each Linux distro comes with its own learning curve. So. That's something I've been thinking about. I've also been considering my dependence upon "the Cloud". First off, what is "the Cloud". Long story short, the Cloud is a computer that your computer uses to do some function. That function could be data storage, heavy computing, or any other sort of thing. I use Google as my Cloud solution provider, but each of the following bullets could be applied to any cloud service. **Top 5: Pros of life in "the Cloud":**5\. If my laptop decides to perform a murder-suicide on my external hard drive, I won't lose all of my stuff. 4\. I can access and manipulate any & all of my stuff from my phone, tablet, or Chromebook on the road without any foresight required. 3\. Google can manipulate my stuff **for** me - making it **better**. 2\. You can harness the power of a supercomputer cluster from a low-powered client device. 1\. It's magic. **Top 5: Cons of life in "the Cloud":**5\. If Google all the sudden closed their doors, or just shut down the Drive product, I would lose everything I didn't have saved locally. 4\. If Google decided I was breaking their terms of service, they could shut me off from all my stuff. 3\. I have no way of knowing if somebody sitting in a datacenter somewhere can/is snooping on all of my stuff. 2\. I have no way of knowing if somebody sitting anywhere along the path from my computer to that datacenter can/is snooping on all of my stuff. 1\. Nobody understands the Cloud Basically, "the Cloud" is ephemeral in nature, depends on factors outside of your control, and comes with inherent privacy risks. Local software can runnable forever. Local storage is permanent (barring hardware failure, theft, or some other catastrophe). Local software & storage is less prone to privacy concerns. Local stuff is within your control. I use KeePass instead of LastPass because I don't like the idea of storing my passwords in "the Cloud". I DO use the Cloud for backup of all my photos, documents, music, and finished home videos. I'm still deciding just how comfortable I am with that. I'm going to end my discussion of computer stuff by just saying a bunch of Linux-related buzzwords. Command CLI GNU BASH targz kernal flags linux environment Ubuntu packages makefile distro user compression SUDO script FAT32 GNOME Unity GIMP SQL partition permissions Intel Mir directory repository Python. **Top 5: Possible Directions I've Seriously Considered Going**5\. Stop and turn on a dime, throw away everything including my phone and start over with all Apple products. 4\. Keep all my current hardware, buy a terabyte of Google Drive space and move everything to it. 3\. Keep all my current hardware, buy a Network Attached Storage device (NAS) and make my own personal cloud. 2\. Get rid of my non-Chromebook laptops and build a custom desktop computer running one of two Linux distros. 1\. Keep all my current hardware, maybe make it dual boot to Linux, and buy another external hard drive. The least fancy option and the one I'm probably going with.

# Motto: having a girlfriend you can see >> having a girlfriend in elsewhereville

The first segment of this column was written 4 days ago. Until further notice this is effectively an old post within a new post.

Remember that desk I was talking about during my last column? Check this out.

![](assets/25-1.jpg)

You know it looks good. The cables behind the monitor are there only for the three lamps. The middle lamp is a strip light behind the monitor. Got it at Ikea. Produces a nice effect. I have a power strip back there that only the lamps are plugged into. I leave them on all the time, just turn off the strip when I'm not around. That way, one switch hits three lamps. Pretty smart? You know it is.

Actually that's so good, let's have another look at it.
![](assets/25-2.jpg)

Alright alright, enough about the desk.

Consider this further notice. We are officially back to me writing about the present day (although that desk thing is still pretty new and quite spiffy). 

Melissa is back from Timbuktu, formerly known as eslewhereville, formerly known as BFE, formerly known as Bradford Woods in Indiana. The past 72 hours or so have been dedicated to bringing her from Kansas City, getting her situated, getting her stuff ready to be shipped out again, taking her and her sister to Topeka, and helping them move in to their new place. Also I got to play with her little brothers a lot. It was nice playing at a 7 year old's level again. 

About the new arrangements; they are nice. They are very nice. I'm angry about how nice they are. I want to live there. I asked how much it would be to kick out all four girls living there and just live there myself. I got no response. 

Really though, for a college house, it's entirely ritzy. For a regular house, actually, it's still pretty darned nice! I look forward to spending some time there.

I like her place.
I like her family.
I like her.
We get along.

I was going to put a picture of her and I from the last twopointfive days right here, but apparently we have no pictures from this period together. All other pictures were taken in someone else's house, hence I don't feel like it's my place to put them on the general internet. So you'll just have to make do with this drawing I just did in paint:

![](assets/25-3.jpg)

12 days into my "film every day of a year" project. I'm still going strong. Same with the journal. I am going to follow through on these things. You'll see.

# Top 5: Things I expect my first real place to have
5. a really nice and large desk on which I can do my workings
4. a really nice and large bed on which I can do my slumbering
3. a really nice and large couch on which I can do my lounging
2. a really nice and large TV on which I can do my watching
1. a bathroom

Sorry this should have been multiple smaller posts. Whatever. Skip to whatever looks interesting! 

# JARVIS, AI, and Trust

I don't see a world where we can each have our own JARVIS. 

15 years ago[^1] when Iron Man debuted in theaters, I would have said it would never happen because I didn't think the *technology* would allow it. I still think it can't really happen, but longer because of the technology - instead because of **trust**. I think with the recent(ish) jump forward we've seen with AI, it is arguably *already possible* (or very close to it) to make everyone their own personal JARVIS - see [here](https://youtu.be/BEw5EFqCCEI?si=JgQ2nrF5mxDGlR2x) for some evidence. The thing that will (or won't, but perhaps “should”) stop it from happening is the issue of trust. 

The problem is a matter of whose best interests the AI will serve. Tony Stark built his own assistant. He knows whatever response he gets back will ultimately trace back to the influences he baked into the system. 

But people en masse will ***never*** program their own AI. People won't understand how it works. So how can they ever trust that when they ask their own personal Jarvis to schedule an appointment for the closest restaurant that serves a good tamale, that the restaurant picked will have to do with your tastes or the restaurant who paid the AI maker the most. 

Once you get to the ultimate “can give you any answer” machines, who decides what's right? We continue to wade into this strange world of having to code-in ethics. Coding ethics into the machinery we have around is actually already a thing. If you're in your self-driving car and someone runs out in front of you... should the car swerve off the road to avoid them? Or should it plow them over to minimize risk to its occupants? These questions are actively being asked and I'm real curious about the cross section between ethics and engineering.

The future is crazy, and the future is now.

Speaking of self-driving…

# Our Year with a Tesla

Among our friends and family, we were early adopters of electric vehicles. It occurs to me that there's a >90% chance anyone reading this probably won't already own one. So here we go. Opinion time. 

Two years ago when we started stately looking at vehicles, getting an EV felt crazy. Now that we've had one for the past 14 months, it feels totally normal. The Model Y is the most popular EV right now in terms of sales. It's in the top 5 best-selling vehicle overall in the United States in 2023. It's everywhere. I used to drive by Teslas and think “oooo how fancy”, but that feeling is gone now. 

## The Good

- **Operational expense** - per mile, my gas car is (at least) 5x more expensive to drive than the EV, also I've spent exactly **zero** dollars on maintenance on Thorki in the past 14 months. My Ford Escape has cost many hundreds despite being driven probably 1/6th as much.
- **Good to go** - every night the car charges in our garage. Every morning it's got “a full tank of gas”. During regular use, you never have to stop anywhere to charge. We have had many full months where we drove every day but never charged outside our garage.
- **Safety and speed** - Teslas have incredible safety features, while also being the first time I ever understood the idea of a car that's “fun to drive”.

## The Bad

- **Phantom breaking** - this is the only serious issue on this list. We have had probably around a dozen instances wherein we were using autopilot and the car suddenly decided it needed to decelerate quickly for no reason whatsoever. They seem to be correlated to very sunny days at around midday. If those conditions are active, I no longer trust autopilot on crowded highways. This needs fixed by Tesla.
- **Windshield wipers** - the automatic windshield wipers are super aggressive. They wipe like crazy in a light sprinkle and sometimes decide it's raining when it is, in fact, not. Annoying.
- **Car wash mode** - we have had a couple instances going into a car wash where the “car wash mode” button was disabled. This resulted in the car wash having to physically stop while we figured out how to make our fancy car do a very basic thing. I refuse to take the car to a car wash now.
- **Carplay** - although the Tesla infotainment center is top-notch, I'd still rather have CarPlay.

## In Short

I don't think we are overly fancy. I think we just so happened to need a new car at the same time that an EV made more sense. Today, if my older, internal combustion engine car were to suddenly go kaput, I would probably replace it with a second Model Y.

Technically we already own two:

# Unicode **𐦝**

Turns out my tattoo is a typeable character if your computer supports a modern version of unicode.

**𐦝**

On my windows machine, that displays an empty square. On my Mac and my phone, I see the eye. Neat.

My next tattoo should also be a Unicode character. Right now I'm thinking “§”, which I think is a pregnant snake.

# Energy Levels

I've had the most consistent energy levels I've ever experienced lately. Midday slumps and evening crashes are something I was really struggling with for the past 2 or 3 years. These are correlated with some changes I've implemented recently. Essentially all of these are from the [Huberman Labs podcast](https://youtube.com/@hubermanlab?si=E3dv1WSiHxENX7Rh), so shout out to Whitney for the recommendation. See the Top 5.

# Brief Check-in on the MCU

I used to **love** Marvel movies. Now I just *like* them. 

It's hard to know what to do once you've reached the end of a 10 year, 22 movie climb and hit the absolute pinnacle of box office success. Hindsight is 20/20 and I honestly love that they tried to do something different, but the unfortunate reality of the MCU is that it grew too big, too quickly. In 2021 there 5 different TV shows and 4 different movies. It's just... too much. What's crazy is that I actually enjoyed basically *all* of them. But I'm not a typical viewer. People other than me were already starting to say "this isn't my cup of tea".

Where the MCU really started to make even me lose some of my fervent adoration was in the back half of 2022 and basically all of 2023: Wakanda Forever. Love and Thunder. Quantumania. All movies that should have been **great**. All of them wound up being pretty disappointing... and then there's the TV show "Secret Invasion" as a crappy little cherry on top. The bad has been outweighing the good.

At this point, public perception has soured on the MCU. I see headlines everywhere saying "they're doomed", which I think is hyperbole - but when I went to watch The Marvels this past weekend I was expecting for it to be "just fine". And that's what it was. It didn't get me hyped. I haven't thought about it since.

I miss being an uber fan. Maybe I'm just getting older. Maybe they've lost their swagger. Who knows. I'll still keep going opening night for now - even if it's just out of habit.



# Top 5: Changes Currently Working Well for My Energy Levels



## 5. Powdered Caffeinated Drink Mixes

Recently grocery stores have started carrying higher-powered caffeinated drink mixes. Previously they only had crystal light with caffeine, which is 60mg/packet. New brands like Celsius and Alani have entered the market with proper high-powered 200mg mixes. One of those actually does the job.



## 4. Morning Walk

I have been trying to get out and do a 10 minute sunrise walk around the block to set my circadian rhythm and get the mind and body going. It's a really nice way to greet the day.



## 3. Skipping Breakfast

I skipped breakfast for a week out of necessity a couple weeks back. After a few days I realized I really didn't miss it. I'm leaning in. Actually started up 30 Day Challenges again with this as the first tone. It's been great thus far. 



## 2. Delayed Caffeine

I make coffee every morning, but now I don't start drinking it until 120 minutes after I step out of bed.



## 1. Running

I started actually doing cardiovascular exercise. Been doing about 8 miles a week, super slow paced. So definitely nothing crazy. But I run now. Did 3 miles yesterday and didn't feel like dying afterwards. That's nuts.

# Motto: Keep It Simple, Stupid (alternatively: Simon)

I stumbled across an animated GIF yesterday that I decided to save. You probably have already noticed it looping below this paragraph - it's awesome. Anyway, I clicked "Save image" then navigated to my folder called "Funny (slash) good to post" and tried saving the image with the name "Overzealous". Windows then asked me if I wanted to save over the existing file with that name. 
I didn't know I already had an internet pictures saved with that name. I checked to see what it was.... it was the same image. I found it so long ago I forgot I had it. The interesting part to me was that I tried naming it literally the exact same thing as I had previously. It's funny how the mind works. 

Without further ado.... "Overzealous":

![](assets/74-1.gif)

YES HELLO THIS IS DOG
You have to admit the little guy's spirit.
That image actually perfectly segways into the main thing I wanted to talk about tonight - how intelligence comes at the price of appreciation.

This all stems from an episode of "This American Life" I listened to today. They did a piece that was a sort of re-telling of the Garden of Eden from the bible. The excerpt in particular that stuck with me was this:

Sometimes when Adam would start to speak, Eve would get all hopeful that he was about to impart something important and smart, but he would only say stuff like, "Little things are really great, because you could put them in your hand as well as in your mouth."

That, to me, was mind-blowing. The fact that we can hold small things and we can put them in our mouths is fantastic. It's FANTASTIC! It's also completely obvious. It's the kind of thing that you realize when you are a toddler and it probably blows your mind for a day or two before you move on to bigger and better things. It falls by the wayside. It becomes "for granted", as they say. I am reminded of an anecdote about a guy who loves stars. He would go outside at night and just stare at them with amazement. He loved them so much he decided to enroll in an astronomy night class to learn more about them. He found that the things he was learning, that stars are made of mostly hydrogen and helium and energy and things of that nature, those things were demystifying them. When he looked up at them, he had understanding - but not wonder. The story ends with him withdrawing from the class just to stare up at them for the rest of his life and be amazed.

You know who has really got it all figured out? Dogs. Especially stupid dogs. Dogs like food, toys, and companionship. Dogs don't worry about licenses, taxes, money, errands, responsibilities, worries and other strictly human-made trifles. That same episode of "This American Life" told the story of a man who tried for five years to make a new cable channel. This channel would have no commercial breaks. No programs. No people. No talking. It would just have puppies. Puppies acting like puppies do. Puppies and some relaxing instrumental music. This guy never got the Puppy Channel (his name for it) off the ground because no major network players wanted to give something so new and drastically different a chance. I think the Puppy Channel is a great idea, though. It is simple. It's universally appealing. It's brilliant.

Try going to [this website](http://www.thepuppychannel.com/) and not smiling. It's not possible for anyone with a soul.

To Segway between that and my last point - here is a relevant XKCD:

![](assets/74-2.png)

XKCD #864 - Flying Cars
Now, I've spoken very negatively about intellect and its effects on appreciation of the little things. What I haven't said, though, was just what we get in return. We can develop a deeper, more fundamental appreciation of larger concepts. I can fathom a robust architectural wonder because I have such a solid grasp of all of the underlying little concepts that I've long since stopped appreciating. The trick is to never stop making forward progress. Never get comfortable with your level of knowledge in this world. There's always something new to learn. Something new to appreciate. If I had to make some snappy slogan out of all of this I'd go with "Don't stagnate, appreciate!" Randall Munroe (the guy who writes XKCD) is a great example of someone with education who hasn't seemed to stop appreciating things. It's one of the many many reasons he's on my list of life heroes.

That's all.

General trajectory: down then back up.

# Subsystems Crash

Moving tossed a stone into the the gears of our day-to-day lives - a bigger stone than I anticipated - at a time when our household was operating like a well-oiled machine. We didn't experience full-on systems failure; but we've certainly seen several subsystems crash and remain offline.

![https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555861496-0666c8981751?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb](assets/414-1.jpg)

Moving to Lawrence interrupted the lowest month-to-month expense rate we've ever had. Shut down a years-long streak of incredible healthy home cooked meals that we teamed up to make as a couple. Reduced me from the peak strength I've ever achieved to something that's more or less equivalent to baseline level.  Stopped forward progress I was making in learning TypeScript and building out the latest vision of my long running coding project. Reduced the number of Columns, Gillespedia articles, and new notes I was writing per week to essentially "none". My Project List, which formerly was pretty well maintained, begun to sink into a bog made from backlogged items. Things are being completed, but at a much slower rate than they are being added. One of the apps I used to keep me consistent on many of those things (Streaks on iOS) has fallen out of my daily routine. Lastly, we went from the longest healthy streak our family has ever achieved directly into the longest streak of back-to-back minor illnesses that we have ever seen (or even *heard of*, for that matter). 

If I felt so inclined I would wallow in a sea of self pity and lay face down on the floor. However I don't feel so inclined[^1]

## Less Doom and Gloom

Each of these things were just **components** of the overall system in which I live my life. They are important, but not truly the most vital of all. There was **not** total systems failure. My relationships have remained strong. Dinner is on the table and each night we sleep with a roof over our head. Illnesses, though they are annoying, are not devastating in nature. Money is flowing out faster than before, but also flowing in faster. 

Most important of all, we have not given up hope.

# Hidden Benefits

Hidden in all of this 'crashing down' is a couple of rare opportunities. Things that **I absolutely will not fail to take advantage of**. I have a chance to chart out the voyage from broken processes and failing systems back to prosperity.

![E0E3D05C-ADE7-4D5A-B26F-E9E9D93D69B7.jpeg](assets/414-2.jpg)

What steps will ultimately bring me to where I was before? What steps will take me past where I had been? 

For one thing, have some time. For more on that, see the Top 5.

## Higher Ceilings

The other thing that keeps me (us) going is the knowledge and strongly-held belief that in this move we built for ourselves an opportunity for a higher ceiling. There is a notion of a 'hedonistic set point'. We've given ourselves a violent enough shove to give that a chance for a new calibration. New set. Higher ceiling. Loftier ambitions.

Also the fresh start has given us a chance to develop a sense of pride and ownership over our residential domain that I never approached in our starter house. This one is **ours**, not because we built it - but because we made it.



# Top 5: Things I Managed to Get Done with a Free Weekend

# Motto: 3.5 hours of completely undivided attention

Before I write about Google I/O I want to say one thing I've noticed about myself time and time again - I am capable of an amazing, almost superhero-like level of focus. After I got off work, I essentially ran home. The first and only thing I did for the next 3.5 hours was watch  the Google I/O keynote address. After Larry Page closed out the keynote, I finally broke concentration. I assessed my situation for the first time in 210 minutes and realized some things that I definitely should have already known. I was sweating. I was starving. I was still wearing a shirt. Two shirts, actually. For those of you that know me well, you'll know how strange it is for me to be wearing a shirt in my own place. This is just one example of a phenomenon that happens every time something truly sparks my interest.

Example from [Column #81]({{siteurl}}/81):
Sunday I sat down at my desk chair at ~3-4pm to work on my Life Tracking project that I wrote about at the end of Column #77. Before I knew it, it was dinner time. I put some chicken from a box in the oven. It took 3 minutes, but I was very annoyed by the interruption. Same story 14 to 16 minutes later when the food was done and I had to go through the painstaking trouble of putting it on a plate for consumption. Next thing I knew it was midnight and I had finished.

From here on out I write only about the news from Google I/O - skip to the quote if you aren't interested.

Google offers developers a number of new APIs. We will soon start to see applications leverage the following new capabilities:
1. Actions based off geographical contexts ("if Billy walks here, do this").
2. Synchronized notifications across multiple Android devices.

That's about it from an end-user perspective. The rest of the APIs, from my somewhat untrained eye, appeared to be mostly upgraded processes on the back end.

Google Play Games services was announced. This essentially gives developers the ability to leverage account management, saved state, and other such game-related activities without having to build their own solution. It will make gaming on Android better, but probably won't revolutionize anything.

Google unveiled a new IDE called Android Studio. "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". What that means in simpler English is "a program to write code in". This particular IDE looks... for lack of better word... sexy. I don't think that adjective has ever been ascribed to an IDE. The timing of this news is perfect and definitely a sign that I should start my Android coding project. I'm installing it right now.

Google released a subscription music service. Google Music "All Access" gives you the ability to stream any music you want, whenever you want, as much as you want, natively on your Android phone or on the web. The service costs $9.99 per month, but there exists a 30 day free trial (in which I am participating). My initial review: It's integrated very well. It's seamless. More importantly, it's very good. The Pandora-like "radio stations" based off songs you pick is very well done. I have been listening to new music that I genuinely enjoy for the past hour and a half.

Google's Hugo Barra got my hopes WAY up for about 30 seconds when he pulled out a Samsung Galaxy S4 running stock Android 4.2. I thought "THEY CREATED A WAY TO FORCE STOCK ANDROID ON ANY PHONE?!?!!?!". Turns out they were just offering to sell a Samsung Galaxy S4 that runs stock Android. It went from a huge, breakthrough, revolutionary thing to being an aside that almost nobody will take advantage of. The phone is only available without subsidy, and it costs $650. The Nexus 4 is available for $350. The hardware advantages of the GS4 are not worth $300 IMHO.

Internet improvements - new file types using new compression. Saving 50% of data increases speed and longevity, decreases cost. Again, something most users won't even know they are benefiting from. Personally, I can't wait to see a day where the WebP becomes the goto photo standard.

The Google+ webpage got a new layout! It looks quite a bit like the Google+ tablet application now. It scales up and down to accommodate windows of different sizes. I'm already a big fan of the change.

Perhaps the biggest news of the day was the unveiling of Google Hangouts as an evolution of the Google Talk instant messaging service. I have the update on my browser, but not on either of my Nexus devices. My initial impressions are that it does what it says it will do (chat, including emjoiis, pictures, and video hangouts) quite well; but it still leaves me a little let down. I was really REALLY hoping for SMS integration. Google Voice integration would have sufficed even. As it is, "Hangouts" really only deserves the title I gave it - an evolution of Google Talk.

Since the inception of Google+ you've had the option to automatically backup all the photos you take in the cloud. Now you also have the option to have them automatically enhanced. My little experimentation with this makes me think it's a bit overzealous with the edits... but it's an interesting idea for sure. It's a great optional feature. It also will create entirely new photos out of your automatically uploaded photos. To test this, I took 5 photos of my new TV setup. It put them together into the animation below automatically:

![](assets/87-1.gif)

That third lamp is going back to Target, by the way.

Google Now is coming to the web. Although not necessarily in so many words. I didn't really get the impression there would be some new dedicated webpage for Google Now. I think it's just being baked into your Google Searches. Also, web voice search got an upgrade or two.

Google Maps got a UI overhaul and several other new features. I'm actually really excited for the new Maps experience. Maps is the completely under-appreciated epitome of smartphone awesomeness. I never think "man, this device is amazing" quite as much as I do when I'm using Google Maps.

I tried keeping that whole thing short. I could talk more to any individual topic, but I won't (for now).

People in the audience wearing Google Glass. That was cool.

This guy from Lawrence that I don't officially "know", but do talk with on Google+ was able to go to the conference. Last night I told him I hated him. I think he understood. When they gave everyone in the audience a free Chromebook Pixel (the $1300 ultrapremium Chromebook), I had to upgrade my hatred of this man to outright loathing. Jealousy like you wouldn't believe.

# Top 5: Things Missing from the Google I/O Keynote
5. Google Keep-related news (this wasn't really expected, but I really wanted it)
4. Google TV-related news
3. Google Glass-related news
2. New Nexus devices &/or the Motorola "X Phone" - possibly due to the next reason
1. Android 4.3 - while this is a disappointment, it really shouldn't be. Android is a mature OS. Rumors about what would come along with Android 4.3 have been sparse. They have been sparse because... what is there to do? Jelly Bean is fantastic.
 

So, basically I went 2 for 5 with my predictions. That's good, right?

Motto: JARVIS, minus most of the utility.

# Voice Assistants

Voice assistants are a large part of technology today. They are arguably the most prominent place where technology brands get to flex their artificial intelligence muscles, and where they literally give a voice to the company. 

## Brief History

In late 2011 the “S” in the newly released “iPhone 4S” supposedly stood for “Siri”, because that was the phone that introduced the general public to the concept of a ‘voice assistant’.

In 2014 Amazon released the Alexa. It was the first *stand-alone* voice assistant. That is to say, it was the first product that was **only** meant to be a voice assistant.

In 2015, Microsoft integrated Cortana into Windows 10 and the Xbox. Nobody cared.

In 2016, Google officially debuted the “Google Assistant”. This was their first “official” and unified take on voice assistants, although variations of concept were already widely in use by various Android OEMs.

In 2017, Samsung introduced their voice assistant, “Bixby”, on their Galaxy line of Android phones. **Really** nobody cared.

Bixby and Cortana will not be mentioned again in this column (or perhaps by anyone anywhere).

## To Smart Speaker, or Not to Smart Speaker - That is the Question

There are plenty of valid reasons you may choose to not have a smart speaker in your house. You could have privacy concerns, don’t want [Alexa listening to you and serving ads based on what it hears](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047026/amazon-alexa-voice-data-targeted-ads-research-report). [You don’t want your kids to be influenced by them](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/11/experts-say-keep-amazons-alexa-away-from-your-kids/). You don’t agree with the value proposition.

## Voice Assistant Comparisons

All three of the legitimate competitors essentially have feature parity. Alexa and the Google Assistant are almost a copy/paste of one-another. Siri is the most different, but that isn’t necessarily a good thing or bad thing. Siri is local-first in some use cases, whereas everything Google and Alexa does a round trip thru the cloud. 

The unfortunate answer to “which is the **best** voice assistant?” comes down to a matter of personal taste. 

If you say Alexa is best, that’s a fair and valid opinion.

If you say Google is best, that’s a fair and valid opinion.

If you say Siri is best, that’s a fair and valid opinion.

If you say you no thanks to all of them, that's a fair and valid option  

## Common Comparisons

If you look up a litany of comparisons, you’ll find one majority opinion is pretty common. 

### Q&A

Google is best at answering questions. Alexa is okay. Siri is the worst. 

### Privacy

Meanwhile Siri is ‘the most’ private, whereas Google is a little less private, and Alexa has been outright accused of listening to your conversations to target advertisements. 

### Device Support

Alexa has been around the longest, and at this point probably offers the widest array of supported device. Google is next. Finally Siri is the least likely to be supported by whatever random device you pick up at Target.

## My Thoughts

At this point, I can say I have a lot of experience with all three of the legitimate voice assistant platforms in today's market. I’d wager I’ve said “Okay Google”, “Hey Siri”, and “Alexa” all *about* the same number of times, and that number is measured in the high hundreds or the low thousands. Even where I sit right now I can literally say “OKAYGOOGLEHEYSIRIALEXA PLAY HAMILTON” and, if I say it fast enough, I’ll start hearing the musical of the decade playing from 3 different places at once.

For me, having a smart speaker is a net benefit, considered against privacy concerns. I like to play music. I like to find out the forecast. I like to set timers. Sometimes I use them to control my smart home features. Every so often I use them for extemporaneous circumstances[^1].

At the same time, they all feel like they **could** be so much better. The reason I have all three ecosystems is because all three of them exist in this Goldilocks zone:

![Untitled](assets/420-1.png)

Here’s the crazy piece:

The Google Assistant **would** be in the green zone, if it didn’t have **by far and away** the most annoying trigger phrase. I still despise saying “OH KAY GOU GUUL”. It's just not a group of syllables that feel good coming out of your mouth. I still think there’s a very real causal link between my getting fed up saying “Google” over and over again that made me switch from ‘The Android guy’ to being an iPhone user. 

If Google announced tomorrow support for custom assistant names, I’d switch back to Pixel phones, Chromebooks, and Google Homes exclusively.

# Matter

There is (finally) a coming interoperability standard that seems like it will make the promise of “the smart home” into a real reality. Google, Amazon, and Apple (amongst others) are part of a group working on a technical spec (called ‘Matter’) for internet connected device standards. This would give device manufactures the ability to create products that seamlessly interact with any of the three major voice assistants without writing custom handling software on a per-vendor basis. Today, you have to check on a device-by-device basis to see which of the perspective smart home features you’re looking to buy into to see if the developer has built-in support with your smart assistant of choice. This also opens up the ability for more creative cross-device interplay, because [standardization enables creativity](https://www.notion.so/Standardization-Enables-Creativity-a15d9e99a9184c5da554b747163a8533). 

After writing all of the above I thought briefly about my sister, who probably couldn’t care less about the relative advantages or disadvantages of which voice assistant you should use... then I started thinking about what I couldn’t care less about. So now for something completely different from the first half of this Column.

# Big List of Thing about which I Couldn’t Care Less

This is an incomplete list of things I don’t think about, don’t worry about, and definitely don’t want to talk about with the person next to me on the bus.

1. **Sports** - if I’m not playing, then I don’t care.
2. **Cars** - can it drive the speed limit? Cool.
3. **Reality Shows** - people I don’t know doing things that don’t matter.
4. **Celebrities’ personal lives** - can they act? Cool.
5. **NFTs or Crypto** - not buying in. Don’t care.
6. **Astrology** - obviously.
7. **What brand you’re wearing** - do they fit? Cool.
8. **Your religious beliefs** - so long as nobody’s getting hurt, you do you. I’ll do me.
9. **The Emmys/Grammys/Oscars/Tonys** - who makes ‘the best art’ is subjective.
10. **How tall some person you know is** - what am I supposed do with this information? What possible reaction can I have other than a disingenuous “wow”.



# Top 5: Rhyming ‘Gimmes’

Some topics include obviously rhyming words. Using these isn’t “bad” necessarily, but don’t pretend like using any of these is impressive.



## 5. Car, Far

Admittedly I used this one the other day when I made up a jingle to get my 1 year old into the car.



## 4. Track, Clack

This wouldn’t have occurred to me before I had kids and took up the role of the primary bedtime book reader... every single children’s book rhymes “track” with “clickety-clack”



## 3. Boat, Float

Use this if you want, whatever floats your boat I guess.



## 2. Clock, Tick Tock

Dr. Seuss even falls into this one.



## 1. Fly, Sky, High

Looking at you, Reading 🌈

# Motto: It's all good (except the bad stuff).

Today I learned that Android was born on the 5th of November. That means exactly five years ago today, someone small with big ambitions set out to overthrow those currently in power. Not unlike another story that's been told somewhere in history...

![](assets/40-1.png)

On an unrelated note: I do not like Autotune. Whoever created autotune should be slapped for contributing so effectively to the end of music. Allowing talentless people to pass themselves off as "artists". It's weak. You know, they say "where there's a will, there's a way", and that's true. "The way" used to be "practice for hours and days and weeks and months and years and then you might get good". Now, "the way" is just to put your crappy voice into a special metal box that poops it out on the other side sounding like garbage, then feel good about yourself. We've lowered the bar far enough that anyone can become famous!

\#Rant

Anyway.

I got to see some of my old residents this weekend. Sometimes I miss being their RA. Then I remember my swanky new place and the job with the money and I feel better. Still, it would be nice having [minions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuzyODgWRp4) again.

Before that, I did yoga as part of a group lead by an instructor. It was the first time I'd done yoga with an instructor. I did it Saturday morning, 47 hours ago, to be exact. I'm still sore, 47 hours later. I respected chicks who do yoga before, but I respect them even more now.

I really love "Fall Back" daylight savings' time. It's amazing how the extra hour of sleep can make such a huge difference. I actually got up to work out this morning. Also, on an semi-related note, I woke up on my own at 5:59 this morning. My alarm goes off at 6:00. It's weird when that happens.

Going to keep this short. Got work to do in 10 minutes.

# Top 5: Categories from the [Demetri List](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/10/35), by how well I've done in them since I started (each category has had a total possible score of 105 points so far)
5. 45 - Care for Others
3. 35 - Care for Your Body
3. 35 - Care for Your Mind
2. 34 - Do what You Do Well
1. 33 - Manage Your Life

I had no idea those were so close until I put this top 5 together. Weird.

# Motto: I keep looking up the definition of insanity, it always says the same thing

I'm back in Lawrence. Worked out yesterday in the most "old-fashioned" way imaginable.  Going to apply to a few new places.

This past weekend was awesome. Saw my cousins. Went to Gander Mountain and Cabela's. Decided Gander Mountain is far superior. Swam. Ate like kings. Sat around a fire. Played Battlefield 3 four TV's wide - See below.

![games](assets/11-1.jpg)

It was a blast.

I've been doing a bit of back-sliding on areas of focus. A long time ago I decided I wanted a master note taking system that I could use for the rest of my life to keep things organized and keep my head on the right direction. The search for the best option became a bit of an obsession a couple years ago. Back then I settled for Springpad... but after a recentish update it is clear Springpad is going a different direction than I like. Last night, I broke the problem down and reached a few conclusions...

First off, what do I ideally want to keep track of?
- a history of doctor's visits, employment, vacation, and other major events
- legal forms, taxes, warranties, inventories, and financial tracking
- quotes, thoughts, notes to self, tips & advice, artwork, and the columns
- places, dates, and people of interest
- list of favorites, projects, ideas, and goals
- more as they come along

What features would the system ideally have?
- Digital and Ubiquitous - must be backed up locally and online and accessible both ways
- Must be able to handle many types of notes - text, spreadsheets, PDFs, pictures, etc.
- Must include some sort of security - password protection
- Should be fully compatible with Android (specifically use the "share" API)
- Should be organized and searchable
- Should be convenient and aesthetically pleasing 
- Additional features such as reminders, "add to ____" in Chrome, etc.

The Top 5 below is a comparison of the five best options that I'm aware of existing. I'm dedicating the first portion of today to a head-to-head usage test of the top three competitors. Basically fill out notes of various types and see how the implementation plays itself out across my phone, computer, and the web.

# Top 5: Note Taking Systems & Their Strengths and Weaknesses
## 5. Pen & Paper
The Good: I can do whatever I want with pen and paper.
The Bad: Indexing, searching, backup, ubiquity, and aesthetics all suck. There is obviously no support for android and the conveniences of a digital system.
## 4. Dropbox
The Good: Handles all types of notes (handles all types of everything). Available everywhere. Good organization.
The Bad: Dropbox is definitely not a note-taker, it is a file backup and sync service. There is no real native way to view notes nor edit them from a phone. Search is limited. 
## 3. Evernote
The Good: Very well integrated into Android. Available across all platforms. Wide developer support. Handles text and pictures very well. Acceptable levels of search. Quick to make and open notes.
The Bad: Does not have adequate security. Does not handle spreadsheets. Disappointingly little organization. Wants you to do "Premium" for advanced features.
## 2. Google Drive
The Good: Very well integrated into Android. Available in equal parts across all platforms. Handles all types of notes. Acceptable levels of search and organization. 
The Bad: Does not have adequate security. Every note opens in its own viewer and takes a while to do so. Seeing information from more than one note at a time would be hardest this route.
## 1. Microsoft OneNote 
The Good: Aesthetically superior. Password protected notes. Great organization. Feature-filled & technically capable of handling most any note type. Acceptable levels of search.
The Bad: Very poor Android implementation. The online option sucks. Only text notes are easy and searchable.

I've spent the past few Columns going hyper-specific on stuff. This one will be more diffuse in focus. Aka perhaps more interesting.
# Principles
I am currently reading "Principles" by Ray Dalio. It's not *introduced* the concept of principles to me, but has me thinking about them. In particular I'm revisiting my [[General Operating Principles]]. That list is worth a gander[^0] if you're at all interested, but the TL;DR of the top-level principles is the Top 5, below.
# Words
It's funny to me me how some words mean different and seemingly totally random things.
## Examples
> [!example] Gauntlet
> 1. A glove thing
> 2. A series of challenges

> [!example] Spring
> 1. A metal coil
> 2. A small stream of water
> 3. Set free from capture

> [!example] Match
> 1. A little fire starting thing
> 2. A particular instance of competition
> 3. Descriptor of two things that are alike

> [!example] Lint
> 1. Little bits of fabric that fall off
> 2. An automation that ensures text-based content adheres to stylistic standards

> [!example] Gander
> 1. Look at
> 2. Male goose
# Tall
I've not spoken with someone taller than me in the past 5+ years. The last time I remember talking with someone taller than me was in 2018. Fun fact.
# Recent Rabbit Hole
After writing a ton about my [[PDW]] and [[Making an Obsidian Bullet Journal|Obsidian Bullet Journal]] recently. I decided to pry open [the main PDW library](https://github.com/aarongilly/pdw) and start tinkering. I spent 12+ hours chipping away at complexities, only to arrive at something that was ~5% less complicated. It all worked again, and worked *better*; but **I was left unsatisfied**.

So I started over. 

Only this time rather than trying to chip away what didn't feel necessary, I took a [zero-based budgeting](https://gillespedia.com/Zero-Based+Budgeting) approach and started with **nothing** then *added in* what absolutely had to be there. It is still in work, but seemingly coming out *dramatically* simpler. [Cardinality is always one of the most important architectural decisions](https://gillespedia.com/Cardinality+is+Always+One+of+the+Most+Important+Architectural+Decisions). I made a cardinality change, and everything[^1] is much simpler. 

![[461-1.png]]

My key design philosophy this time around was to make the entire system as simple to explain as possible. **What is the fewest number of parts and rules I could use, while still retaining the essence of the project?** This is producing very promising-looking results[^2].

I might do another post on this at some point, might not. I know this topic is essentially me writing for me[^3]. 
# Finishing Ingredients 
A thing I have aged into, really getting pumped when we finish ingredients we have on hand. When we get to perfectly empty the container of (cheese, chicken, etc) for a recipe... oh boy that's a sure sign things are going according to plan. I just ate the last of the rice, chili, bacon, cheese, and sour cream all at once. Simple joys of life. 
# Infinite Firm + Illness
In [[459#Infinite Firm|Column 459]] I introduced my intention to transition from 75 Hard™️ to *Infinite Firm*. That was about a month ago. During that month every single member of my family has been sick with COVID, plus a couple of bonus mystery illnesses. So how's it going?

| Infinite Firm Daily Goals                   | Days Successfully Met |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No alcohol on work nights                   | 24 of 24 work nights  |
| Drink a gallon of water, at least 1/2 plain | ~30 of 33 days        |
| Spend 30+ minutes outside every day         | ~30 of 33 days        |
| Work Out                                    | 21 of 28 healthy days |
| Intermittent Fasting                        | ~10 of 33 days        |
| Read a book or mediate for 10 minutes       | ~10 of 33 days        |

Those are arranged from most to least successful. The intermittent fasting thing surprised me somewhat. I've woken up hungry a lot. And the reading thing is simply because I'm dedicating all my "me" time to the PDW re-vamp. Overall I'm pretty pleased with my adherence.

# Top 5: Top-Level [[General Operating Principles]]
The list I've made & linked to just there is hierarchical. This is the top-most level of that hierarchy.
## 5. Use systems to manage your life
## 4. Keep it simple and focused
## 3. Bias toward action
## 2. Embrace the pain
## 1. Pay attention to what's important
## 0. Don't go it alone

# Motto: Randall Munroe is my hero.

Yesterday I got stuck on the elevator in my building. I was trapped, alone in a 4x6 cell for 45 minutes. The worst part of it all: I had no cell service.

NO CELL SERVICE.

I had to THINK. I had to BE ALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS. I wasn't ENTERTAINED BY ANYTHING. I'm fairly sure it's the hardest thing anyone has ever had to go through ever.

Actually I made a video while I was in there. Just spent an hour clipping out some of the better parts. Here's the best 3 1/2 minutes:

(this video is lost to time)

Today I won $60 on a slot machine bet. I came out of the casino with all 60 of those dollars, too. If you watched that video before reading on, you'll already have known that.

I've been to a casino twice in my life now. Even when I actually win I don't like them. It feels... weird. Wrong.

The second thing I wanted to write about was pretentiousness. I have two stories to share of pretentiousness.

Pretentious-  (adjective) attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed. I don't use this word according to its exact definition, apparently, but you'll figure out what I mean by the word shortly.

Wednesday a lady asked me how tall I was (this happens often). I answered her. Her response irked me. Here's how it went:
Lady - "(swearword)! How tall are you?"
Me - "I'm 6'8" "
Lady - "Oh no, no way. My boy is 6'9" and you are definitely taller than him"
Me - "...alright..."

To me, what she said was pretentious. How self-important do you have to be to think that you know my height better than I do? You know, that thing that I have been asked about daily for years and years? You don't think I, a degree-holding engineer, haven't managed to accurately measure that?

You're son is lying to you. Probably others, too.

The second example is much older and much, much worse.

I took an acting class at KU (I was a film major for a year and a half). During this acting class, some big guru from high-up in the university came in to observe. He wanted someone to perform a monologue for him, so he could critique. The instructor picked me out to do my bit for this bigwig. 

I stood up, went to the front of the class, and introduced myself.

Me - "Hi, my name is Aaron and-"  
Guru (interrupting me) - "What was that? What's your name?"  
Me - "...Aaron"  
Guru - "How do you spell that?"  
Me - "A, A, R, O, N"  
Guru - "OH! You mean AARON."   
(I say "air in", he said "*aah ren*")  
The next thing he said -  
**"I just want you to know how to pronounce your own name correctly."**  

And that, my friends, is the most pretentious thing I've ever heard.

The next thing that happened was my instructor mouthed the word "no!" to me with a somewhat panicked look. Apparently I looked like I wanted to do this:

![](assets/50-1.gif)

# Top 5: Things I've learned from the first 6 weeks using the Demetri List
5. I'm averaging 9.2 goals crossed off per day... this is out of 25 possible (not good)
4. I'm 40% more productive on Mondays than every other day's average
3. My best 3 goals: "Went on a friend date", "Brushed (x2)", and "Took care of my relationship"
2. My worst 3 goals: "learned/practiced something useful", "used time well", and "Focused less on myself"
1. Summary of all events: I waste time on the weekends... who knew?

For literally years I lamented my [note-taking platform anxiety](https://aarongilly.com/258), until along came Notion and more or less destroyed the competition once and for all. Now I have a new related-but-different app choice anxiety problem. 

# Whiteboarding Apps

Whiteboarding apps are meant to mimic a large whiteboard. They let you draw, write, attach images and sticky notes freely on a 2-dimensional canvas. They are an invaluable asset in the hands of creative-types. Whereas note-taking is the diligent recording of facts and thoughts, whiteboarding is the freeform expression and development of **ideas**. There isn’t a de facto standard for whiteboarding - no clear champion against which all others must be judged. Instead there are a myriad of options, each coming with their own pros and cons. Standard features typically include an infinite canvas, realtime collaboration, intelligent diagramming, and robust support for freehand drawing, but there's large variation from app to app.

I’m looking at apps that allow for drawing, diagraming, and allowing ideas to come about naturally. **Specifically looking for something that best fills the void in Notion’s highly structured, linear form**; and there are a lot.

![Notion plus something](assets/430-1.jpg)

I’m going to do the work, so you don’t have to. What follows is a rundown of some of the competitors in this arena. I’m going to use them to explain their pros and cons, and illustrate their workflow with Notion to embed a drawing, open the drawing, modify it, and see the modification in Notion.

<aside>
Final note before we get started:  
Drawing = literally just drawing stuff with an Apple Pencil  
Diagramming = making flowcharts using text in shapes that can be freely repositioned
</aside>

## GoodNotes 5

GoodNotes 5 is the app I’ve been using for this purpose for the past few years. It’s not intended as a “whiteboarding” app, instead it mimics a digital *notebook*. GoodNotes was designed to be the notebook you use when you’re attending class. It’s feature set is built around making the process of **note taking** as seamless and intuitive as possible - the fact that it *also* works as a blank canvas on which to sketch out ideas is sort of a happy accident. It works pretty well for that purpose, but leaves some things to be desired in a proper “whiteboarding” application.

![Goodnotes board](assets/430-2.png)

## Freeform

Freeform is the reason this Column exists. I was happy making GoodNotes work until Apple debuted Freeform, their “official” whiteboarding app. Freeform is baked into every iPhone, iPad, and Mac as of the latest software update. It’s got an infinite canvas that allows you to work in real time with others as simply as sending them a text. It’s got some really nice things about it, but also some annoyances.

![Freeform board](assets/430-3.jpg)

If you’ve got an Apple product, [click here to see a read-only copy of that board](https://www.icloud.com/freeform/098QgxQNpj-R7-QQwpQZnQmSQ#Freeform-Notion_Setup). 

## Excalidraw

Excalidraw is an open source, browser-based whiteboarding app with a hand-drawn look. Excalidraw is *awesome*. It is the one I *want* to use. I **love** the aesthetic it creates and several other tricks it has up its sleeve. You can save Excalidraw boards as standard image files (PNG or SVG), while also baking-in the data necessary to open them back up in Excalidraw and continue working on them. Collaboration is dead simple. I can send you a link to an excalidraw and you and I can be collaborating on it in real time *immediately*, **no sign up or sign in required**.  [It’s this easy](https://excalidraw.com/#json=76n9ryQ4Elr-yrbVyWbLA,js4y-II7lJFNzBLfJT-nsg). Also it’s open source and saves in non-proprietary plaintext formats; which means Excalidraw files will probably remain openable *forever*.

So why isn’t it the automatic winner?

Well… it’s buggy… and its UX on mobile is not fun. You can install it to your device as a Progressive Web App, but you can’t associate that app with the “.excalidraw” filetype on iPad or iPhone. You have to open the app, then open the file from within in the app. More friction compared to the others on this list. Also - in **theory** it enjoys a native integration with Notion - in reality I find that integration is wholly unreliable and unusable.

![Excalidraw board](assets/430-4.jpg)

[Click this link to see an editable copy of that Excalidraw board right in your browser](https://excalidraw.com/#json=Rv-2x5wRotbA3573MuTGW,aBXR9oDPDMGmvnuDe6ewCw). Seriously click it, Excalidraw is awesome.

## FigJam

FigJam is a product I was almost wholly unaware of before writing this Column. It’s from the creators of the design app “Figma”, and its designed to be *very* fun to use FigJam is worth the price I paid for doing this research. For a week after writing about it I was pretty sure FigJam was going to replace GoodNotes as my daily driver. For the purpose of this Column, let's pretend it did[^1]. 

<aside>
👌 FigJam is great.

</aside>

FigJam has the **best** Notion support (by far), the **best** feature set (**also** by far), and the **best** all-around user experience across desktop, iPad, and mobile.

![figma board](assets/430-5.jpg)

FigJam embeds in Notion can work in two ways - a full-blown FigJam embed allows you to scroll around on the whiteboard (but not edit it) and see changes happen in real time. Alternatively, you can choose to “paste as Preview”, which gives you a *snapshot* of whatever you pasted in that cannot be scrolled but CAN be updated to the most recent value by clicking “refresh”. both options provide a one-click access to open FigJam to the correct spot and start editing immediately. This is easily the best workflow.

[Click here to see a read-only version of that FigJam board.](https://www.figma.com/file/Kh3PF7rL2vJhcz7s7yDBSs/FigJam-Eval?node-id=0%3A1&t=n9dyuM7THbvEeopH-1)

## Miro

Miro is a paid app and suffers for it. They want you to subscribe to do all sorts of things - while I’m happy to pay for things, these things are available elsewhere for free. Miro looks to be pretty alright if you are to “buy in” to using their ecosystem… but I’m definitely not doing that.

The UI is too cluttered & distracts from your content. Their intended use cases don’t seem aligned with my own (individual wanting a simple whiteboard to embed into Notion). While they **do** offer native Notion embeds, I got so frustrated trying to make it work and gave up. So there’s no example board to be seen here.

## Other Apps

There are other options that I ruled out more quickly. Here’s an incomplete list:

![table of others](assets/430-6.jpg)

# Decision Matrix

A decision matrix (aka “Pugh Matrix” aka a couple other names) is a tool to used to rank competing options in a rigorous and (supposedly) objective way. The general idea is you come up with criteria you care about, assign each of those criteria a weighting factor, score each of your options against each criteria, then finally multiply the scores received by the weighting factor and sum up the overall score to determine the “optimal” choice. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. There's an example below. 

## Decision Matrix Problems

My experience with decision matrices is that they aren't objective. They are just subjective in a slightly more rigorous way. They have many potential points of failure.

Your decision matrix might suck if:

- You fail to include all criteria you care about, or include unnecessary criteria that dilute what is actually important
- You and your collaborators don't agree on criteria, or criteria weighting
- You don't have an objective scoring system for each criteria & rely on opinions
- An option on the table solves your problem in a way that *just so happens* to not line up with your criteria

## Defending the Decision Matrix

So if a decision matrix is prone to failing in numerous ways, does that mean it’s useless? No. They can be helpful.

First, there are a number of mitigations you could put in place to make the scoring systems less subjective. You could use the wisdom of the crowds, or perhaps your situation lends itself to obvious criteria and objective metrics against which you can score each option without requiring judgment. 

Even if none of that works, just by putting in the work to think about and talk about what's important will *probably* give you the information you need in order to know what you *want* to win. Sometimes that's all you need.

# A Whiteboarding Decision Matrix

![a table of numbers](assets/430-7.png)

Options along the top, criteria along the side. Each criteria holds a weight factor, each option is ranked against each other option. The “best” option in each row gets the 10. The others are ranked relative to it. The score at the bottom of each column is the sum of the numbers in the column after they are multiplied by their corresponding weight factor. So, GoodNotes is a 10 in the “Fun on iPad” criteria, which has a weighting of “8”. So 8 x 10 = 80 points. Continue down each row and you end up with 380 points for GoodNotes. The other columns are scored in the same way.

Notes:
- All of those scores are subjective. Herein lies the myth that decision matrices are “objective”.
- GoodNotes means the app “GoodNotes 5”, which isn’t free… but is a one time expense that I’ve already paid, so continuing to use it for me is effectively free.

# Conclusion

I’m going to use FigJam[^2]. I already made that choice **before** doing the decision matrix, and the decision matrix reinforced that choice.

I am *also* going to keep Excalidraw in mind when I’m looking for something with a particular aesthetic - or if I’m wanting to actually do collaborative whiteboarding with someone remotely. I *adore* their “no sign-in required, no install necessary” operating model, and the results end up looking very pleasing. I’m also probably going to use Excalidraw for any drawings or doodles I’d want to keep for posterity - say as part of my body of Notes. I love that the project is open-source and the files are simple JSON text files. I think a local install of Excalidraw is pretty future-proof. And if Excalidraw fixes a few bugs and get their Notion embed worked out - I might switch to it full time for everything.



# Top 5: Best Notion Companion Apps for Drawing & Diagramming



## 5. Miro

Any number of options could have been #5.



## 4. Excalidraw

Will be higher when/if they fix the Notion workflow.



## 3. GoodNotes 5

Assuming you already bought it… otherwise it’s at #4.



## 2. Freeform

Assuming you have Apple stuff… otherwise it’s not really an option.



## 1. FigJam

The clear winner.

# Motto: 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds

About the motto - I'm watching Donnie Darko. So you might have to take this entire post with a grain of salt.

Maybe a cinder block of salt.

Unlike Inception, I've never seen Donnie Darko before.

For a bit of insight as to how my brain works, I am writing this sentence an hour and a half after the previous sentence.

Donnie Darko was... interesting.

Alright, yea. Column. Okay. 

So I got my EDC bag in the mail today. I like it. I got myself a nice Decepticon patch for it. It's awesome. Visual evidence of awesomeness:

![Sitka](assets/8-1.jpg)

The bag itself is looking like its going to fill its intended purpose perfectly. It's a Maxpedition Gearslinger Sitka. Very high quality. Feels very tough. Fits in all the stuff I'm including later in my Top 5. I'm pretty pumped. 

Probably not as pumped as my cousin is... We went and got him a golden retriever. It was good times hanging with the brothers. Made me look forward to when I get my first dog. They are awesome.

I want to spend more time in Lawrence. I like it there.

This post was light on the entertainment value. My bad.

# Top 5: Items I'll carry in my EDC bag (ideally)
5. Everything I'd normally carry in my pockets if I have none - Cell Phone, Wallet, Keys, Pocket Knife
4. Cell phone charger + Headphones
3. A waterbottle and some drink mixes (I am a big fan of crystal light)
2. Pens, pencils, a pen-sized flashlight, and a pen-sized 4 bit screwdriver
1. My Tablet, it's keyboard, its charger, flash drive, other such items

# Motto: This Column is Handsome, but Not Hot


Human beings are beautiful - this is something the Greeks knew and appreciated long before any of us were ever around. Unfortunately I feel like it has become almost a taboo subject. Like, to talk about human beauty is to make the listener feel uncomfortable or self-conscious about their perceived imperfections.

But you are perfect. You may not be perfect in exactly the way you think you should be thanks to movies, magazines, and models; but you are perfect. You are the human, and the human body is a beautiful and amazing thing.

Now, to completely counteract everything I just said, I'm going to talk about my theory on the **four** facets of human attractiveness.

This will be a bit long, but hopefully entertaining enough to justify it. Just as a FYI right now, I have sources and a disclaimer at the bottom of the post (above the Top 5).

To say someone is "attractive" is a very general statement. How would you describe their attractiveness? Without going into the specific details of how dainty her neck is or how square his jaw is, I think we all naturally tend to ascribe one or more of the same universal sub-categories of attractiveness. I've toyed around with this notion in the past and have come up with the following guide.

# The Taxonomy of Human Attractiveness:

## "Cute" 
"Cuteness" is hard to put into words, but you know it when you see it. "Cute" is the most innocent and non-threatening term and can therefore be dropped casually in polite conversations. It carries a fair amount of weight and meaning. 

Being "cute" may be associated with one or two exaggerated features (such as big eyes or a little nose). This is important because "cuteness" is one of the terms for beauty that is most often applied to individual features - "she has cute dimples", etc. Cuteness could also be associated with innocence or general un-spoiledness (I tried to think of a better word, I really did). It is possible to be cute without any of those things though - because cuteness is not universal. Although there are some traits that are (almost) universally accepted as "cute" (just think of anything Disney and you got it), cuteness is pretty subjective. Great example - some people find messy hair cute & endearing. Some don't.

Cuteness has a way of hooking you in and drawing you closer on a much more personal level than the other categories. It's the most closely tied to behavior. It's the hardest to separate from personality. It strikes a different cord. And for those reasons, it is the hardest to define. 

Examples of cuteness: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel

![](assets/97-1.jpg)

You just want to pinch their cheeks
Example Runner-Ups: John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer

## "Pretty"/"Handsome"
"Pretty" is to female as "Handsome" is to male. For simplicity, I will refer to both of these terms as just "pretty" from now on. "Pretty" is the best word for the most generic level of attractiveness there is. Being called pretty is definitely a good thing, but not necessarily the best thing.

"Prettiness" is probably the easiest term to define. Being pretty implies a basic level of symmetry and proportionality. It's generally hard to point to any one flaw in the features of a pretty person. 

Another interesting note - it turns out that your "average" looking man or woman is actually quite handsome/pretty. Performing the arithmetic mean on the features of a population removes any abnormalities or exaggerations, leaving behind a surprisingly attractive person. So, if someone says you are "average" looking, make sure to ask "mean, median, or mode?"

Examples of handsome and pretty: Ryan Reynolds and Jennifer Garner

![](assets/97-2.jpg)

"They would be more attractive if.... uh... I dunno"
Example Runner-Ups: Sandra Bullock and Heath Ledger

## "Hot"
"Hot" is the least innocent (and most aggressive) term on the list. Hot is the category most influenced by physique and body composition. Hotness is more visceral and less aesthetic.

Although "hot" is different things to different people, it really originates in our animal instinct for survival and desire to give our potential offspring the best competitive traits. My Biology professor often asked "what is the selective advantage?" of any given trait. Broad shoulders and an athletic build in men make them more capable of providing food for and protecting their young, historically. Wide-set hips and a narrow waist in women may suggest fertility.

![](assets/97-3.jpg)

Examples of hotness: Channing Tatum and Megan Fox

Gratuitous skin shown at no extra charge
Example Runner-Ups: Scarlett Johansson and Adam Levine

## "Classically Beautiful"
I think "beautiful" is the top-tier level of attractiveness. Take "pretty" and "handsome" and ramp them up a few notches. "Beautiful" requires that all of the pieces work together to make a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. The term is technically gender neutral, but it usually only used for women. For men the term could be "Exceedingly handsome" or something similar, but it really boils down to good old-fashioned beauty.

Beautiful people are the kind that you could just stare at for hours - and the longer you stared, the more you would come to appreciate just how well everything comes together. I think "beautiful" carries the most weight of any term for attractiveness. What it suggests is nothing short of a biological art - as though God himself meticulously crafted a stunning frame and adorned it with individual features that perfectly compliment not only each other, but the greater whole.

Examples of classic beauty: George Clooney and Olivia Wilde

It's hard to notice this caption thanks
Example Runner-Ups: James Franco and Natalie Portman 

Then, there are those rare people that nail every single category perfectly:

![](assets/97-5.jpg)

"Don't act like you're not impressed"
Thus ends my guide.

**Side note on Cuteness:**
Cuteness seems to make for the most lasting and endearing on-screen couples. My two cuteness runner-ups were suggested independently by 3rd party individuals. These individuals did not know of each other or what the other had suggested. So, getting both actors that play the famous "Jim and Pam" couple from "The Office" was somewhat surprising. 

![](assets/97-6.jpg)

The Office is/was one of my favorite shows of all time
After I realized those two suggestions were so closely related, I wanted to bump Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel in favor of Jim and Pam... until I realized JGL and Zooey are just as related:

![](assets/97-7.jpg)

This is a still from 500 Days of Summer - one of my favorite movies of all time
Side note on the relationship between the terms: 
I wanted to make a Venn diagram to show all possible combinations of attractiveness clearly; but it turns out that making a true Venn diagram with four categories gives you something really confusing-looking. Check this out -

![](assets/97-8.png)

I pulled blank diagram off [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venn%27s_four_ellipse_construction.svg) and added some numbers to make it clearer. Didn't help much.
The Venn diagram thing is obvious when you think about it. If you add a 4th circle to the traditional "3 overlapping circles" Venn we all think of, you can't have attributes from opposite circles without also having one of the other two. You need 2^X distinct zones to represent X number of attributes in a Venn and 4 overlapping circles is two zones shy of that number. That's low-level counting theory - the only level I ever really understood. I pity the Bool (that's a logic pun right there). 

The various types of attractiveness are inherently related. It's obvious and common how someone can be "cute" and "handsome" or "beautiful" and "hot", but it's more interesting to look at what's not common using my system. You don't see many people who meet all the criteria other than "pretty/handsome". The number on the Venn diagram for that would be 13. I can't think of a single example of a 13. 

One last interesting tidbit, how the words for attractive are related in other ways. You can call an animal "cute", "pretty", or "beautiful", but you absolutely cannot call one "hot". Animal descriptors are limited to options 0-3, or 8-11. Similarly, you can describe an action as being "cute", "hot", or "beautiful", but not really "pretty". 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, or 13.

## **Sources for this column:**
1. Crowdsourcing using anywhere from 1 to 12 people (I used 5 people other than myself, I don't know why I wanted that to be nebulous) I gathered the example celebrities. I learned something from crowdsourcing - nobody agrees on anything ever (except Joseph Gordon-Levitt being cute). I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
2. Biology class. Hard to cite, but true.
3. 24.88 years of observation... and about 10 years of careful observation.
4. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness#General_contributing_factors) on Physical Attractiveness

## **Disclaimer:**
I am biased. My collaborators are biased. We are all white midwesterners in our earlyish 20's. 

I just now realized that positively zero of the attractive people that made it onto this list are blonde. Like I said, I'm biased.


# Top 5: Terms that Almost Made it into My Guide
5. "Sexy" was deemed to similar to "Hot".
4. "Gorgeous" was deemed to similar to "Beautiful". 
3. "Attractive" was removed because you aren't supposed to use the word you are defining in its definition.
2. "Exotic" was suggested, and very very good.
1. "Technically Pretty" was my favorite - used to describe people that have all the necessary attributes to be attractive, but still just didn't pull it off for some reason. I removed this as was explicitly meant to be used for when someone wasn't actually attractive - so it shouldn't be on the attractiveness guide.

Another year down, but 2020 isn't just "another year". While every year has its memorable moments, 2020 was a year nobody will forget. Those enough who are fortunate enough to see it come to a close will forever be changed from what transpired this year.

# Looking Back

## COVID-19

COVID-19 is a tragedy at a macroscopic scale unlike anything I've experienced in my 32 years. At the time of this writing, we in the US are experiencing "a 9/11 a day" a few days each week. Beyond the sheer volume of death, there's universal stressors as people weigh relative risks of potentially dying or killing loved ones versus having creature comforts or seeing relatives during the holidays. Never before did I think I'd have to decide between seeing my parents/giving them a chance to see their new grand baby, or not seeing them/keeping them as safe as possible. This is the kind of choice that everyone from everywhere is having to make right now. It's a tough time for humanity.

But.

With every cloud there is a silver lining. There is no such thing as growth without pain. When the status quo is rocked to its core, we are given an opportunity to invent the new future. We can take constraints and turn them into strengths. 

The family Zoom chat may not be as *personal* as getting together around a dinner table and laughing together, but it has shown that the trip isn't 100% necessary. Any night of the week can become a family gathering night, and maybe we can have them more often. Maybe separately, we can laugh together more often than we ever did before. 

We have an untold number of working professionals who were finally given an opportunity to work from home, and a great proportion of those came to realize: this is great! A huge number of companies have already realized that employees working from home is not only *possible*, but actually cheaper and better for the company. Businesses are learning that face-to-face meetings really aren't required as often as they were being held. We will have fewer business trips and more time spent at home with the family. Fewer commuters and faster roads for those who still do. The globe will be better off by those who are no longer commuting.

## Luckiest

I have been the luckiest person alive ever since I was born. 2020 has just further cemented that fact. I'd **like** to say this is an instance of "the harder I work, the luckier I get", because I have worked hard, but in reality it was all just dumb luck. 

My family and my immediate relatives avoided the plague.

The social impacts of COVID just drove behavioral changes in everyone that I would typically default to anyways, given the choice.

## Second-Time Parents

Melissa and I had a baby boy a couple months ago. Our lives have grown forever richer and we'll get the honor of getting to see two little boys grow up to become whatever kind of man they want to be.

## At Home Living

This pandemic hit shortly after we decided to become a single-income family. It hit right when we began to cement in some super great habits. We have a home gym with everything I ever need. We have a fully stocked kitchen with all the accessories I could ever want (+a few more). 

We have a child who is at an age that's at an age where school isn't a concern. We got to spend maximum amounts of time with him in some of what have to be the cutest months. We had another child. Despite a shaky first couple of hours, has always grown into a healthy and huge little dude!

## Working From Home

I do it all the time now. I mean that quite literally. I am one of those few lucky people who work better from my home office than the cube I used to sit in. My job works better from there. Therefore that is where I am working for the foreseeable future. And it's everything I every thought it would be.

## Fewer Cars

I have no commute. I don't really have a need to have two cars. We sold one of our cars. Also, with the rise of shopping subscription services and grocery delivery, there's even *less* need to drive. We are a one car family now. Been that way for months. Regretted it **zero** times.

## New Tech

I switched from Android to the iPhone back in late 2018, but THIS was the year I really went all in on Apple. I got myself an iPad, Apple Pencil, and Apple Watch. I'm stuck well into the Walled Garden at this point. The only thing stopping me from spending Christmas money on a set of AirPods is fear of hypocrisy (being a self-proclaimed "less, but better" minimalist type). The iPad has become my favorite device I own. I'm moving more and more of the duties my computer used to fill over to the iPad. Maybe someday I won't need a separate computer at all. If my desktop did kick the bucket today, I'd replace it with a Mac Mini.

## Systems

Melissa and I both went HAM in developing systems around the house for ourselves and our kids to be more effective and in control of everything we do. We cut the fat. We are living cleaner and more frugally, while also enjoying a better day-to-day living experience than we had before.

Melissa in particular has been Wonder Woman throughout the whole year. She's an inspiration and genuinely leads me to being a better person by example every day.

### Streaks

Special shout out to the iOS App [Streaks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692) for being such a powerful agent of lasting, meaningful personal changes for both Melissa and I.

### Notion

Extra special shout out to the app [Notion](http://www.Notion.so), which has played an ever-increasing role in our lives. Example: this Column draft is being written in Notion on my phone right now.

## Working Out

This year I met my goal to "not go 3 days in a row without a workout" almost completely [^1]. I got leaner than ever before, while also being near the strongest I've ever been. See the Top 5 for more.

## Other Great Things

There are other great things I choose not to write about. Because not everything needs to be shared. K&D. J&K.

# Looking Forward

In 2021 I have relatively modest goals. Mostly I want to continue the good trajectory we have been on. Be a bit more intentional, a lot less multifocused, and less stressed out about things I can't control and things that don't make a difference. I want to take the **good** life changes that COVID forced into everyone and keep those that have suited us well. I want to continue to save and spend lots of time with the family.


# Top 5: Quantified Results of 2020 & Goals for 2021


## 5. Times Eaten Out - 68

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dj5P1U5p6RGiwIVIUUsRLbPN0WmZ43GCBqz0RFKAGbNuI8tImJpeBWLuvPWf9NwXVMTk6FQn6COjSHGAGA7r_DrGIKML45fmdVbWjHFwb6-5D68zlA-zQvEqW04-ksihMnuOvbf6t3vvQBW-YpnQXiLw=w600-h371-no?authuser=0](assets/404-1.png)

We ate out 68 times in 2020. This includes grabbing dinners, lunches, out, or having them delivered - but not leftovers. 

In 2021, I'd like to get that number down even further to a once/week average.

Additional note: 2020 was the year I decided to stop tracking my calories & macros. So those data don't exist for 2020.


## 4. Named Workouts - 128

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3e1HjRitGeYBuUH00-E27ibotAilgWJ6632uaa5Ypuf4z8-lGoqVBXVk9qZJb1t8PK5vvIknlqsGzrHuVRygGItk8mTp0ckiD4Nh2-wzVrYhL42zbYwUxw78m8x6m7LHJaC1Dd-JDTd3gnF19MFA34y1g=w610-h371-no?authuser=0](assets/404-2.png)

I worked out 128 times in 2020. A heavy majority of these workout sessions are from my rotating compound barbell lift program. But also yoga and basketball (from before COVID). This does not include things like mowing, or riding an exercise bike while working. These are **named** workouts. 

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eSGOzfEus6QV0y4AyLgS8NpAyXs-TqipuFFztVz9M6w3mKdJfyZIm1n5Xh3LWnMijeQ7UNj8qFrziDB9wp52aybBoPe8Yhw42da8C77jbJAC5qlClwvbx9AlHpVWOTgBeo0Vk2oH9gOsFSe-g9gMw4GA=w610-h371-no?authuser=0](assets/404-3.png)

In 2021, I'd like to boost this number to 156 workouts (aka "3 per week"), which I've only managed to achieve *once* in the past 8 years. As such, I'm changing my Streaks app goal from "Once every 3 days" to "3 Days/Week"


## 3. Sleep - Many Metrics

In 2020, I spent 7.7 hours in bed on average, but only 6.9 hours asleep. On an "Average" night I slept from 11:08 PM to 6:53 AM. Note how the gap between the lines in the chart expands right after my second child was born. Kids.

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fETtApb3LTiOUfU7tDyXf5C8SjcEpbrDQGX6myXPMxASLOSQZteu73pbT0GAUn5ltNCsGp_oxUNRIO5PRjtCl6oxu7Bi4zMGpof_M1-or6SpTeUA9Dr1QvGIA3bS_ekNsUiF15KU2sSqNc-OFyBjbDEA=w600-h371-no?authuser=0](assets/404-4.png)

Data recorded with an [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/)[^2]

Another important metric here is the standard deviation of those numbers. My bedtime had a standard deviation of 45 minutes. This means, for those of us who weren't in statistics recently, that 68% of my bedtimes fell between 11:08 PM ± 45 minutes (10:23 PM and 11:53 PM), and 95% of my bedtimes fell within 2σ (9:38 PM & 12:38 PM). 

For 2021, I'm going to be realistic and say that my ability to control my sleep will continue to be restricted. At least I'd like to see that "time asleep" metric go above **7 hours/day**.


## 2. Creative Consumption

In 2020... 

- I started 27 books and finished 25 of them.
- I watched 46 movies, only 2 of which were in a theater.
- I recorded 149 videogames sessions, which were (roughly) 25 minutes on average.
- I watched television 94 times, typically only an episode at a time, but some of those times included multiple episode binges.

In 2021, I'd like those numbers to be...

- 26 books finished
- 52 movies, at least 26 of them being new to me
- 52 videogames sessions
- 52 television sessions


## 1. Creative Output

In 2020 I created...

- 18 [Columns](https://aarongilly.com/tags/) on this website
- 14 [Gillespedia articles](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/)
- 36 [Creations of the Week](https://www.notion.so/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b) (missing zero weeks)
- 514 [Unique, Interlinked, Atomic Notes](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea)
- 104 Guitar Practice sessions
- 26 Episodes of my [We Scene a Movie](https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co/) podcast

In 2021, I'd like those numbers to be...

- 18 Columns
- 18 Gillespedia articles
- 52 CotWs
- 150 New Notes
- 250 Guitar Practice Sessions
- 26 More Podcasts

So, basically just 'keep it up'.

# Motto: Labeled, Segregated, Categorized, Classified, Sorted, Filed, Tabulated, and Designated

This column has been a couple of days in the making... it may be on the long side. You can glance down to get a peak of what you're in for and decide for yourself if it's worth it or not.

You know it's worth it.

This first bit bounces around some. I had a lot of small things I wanted to say that don't gel so well.

I went through and retroactively applied labels to ALL the previous columns. To celebrate, I'm going to add everything to this column that I need in order to give it ever label I plan on using. You can click on any of the labels and see all the columns that are tagged with it. Cool? Cool.

As an electrical engineer, I'd like to take this opportunity to celebrate my 100,000th column!

I want to see a game of Scrabble played between two people who make crosswords for a living. That would be **intense**.

Pandora, the internet radio station that everyone has, had an advertisement in its margins that read “He weighs 190, benches 450. Researchers at Cambridge have discovered a revolutionary new muscle builder. Try this one weird trick and build muscle!”

That made me angry. Angry at advertising (the dude looked photoshopped). Angry at advertisers (praying on the ignorant). Angry at the ignorant that buy into this crap. You want to know a “weird trick” that builds muscle? Exercise. Lift weights and eat an appropriate amount of halfway decent food. That is how you build muscle. The “trick” they are talking about is actually just a trick for them to get your money. For the most part, we are just too lazy to do the thing that works. Work works. So work. Here is what a year of passively paying attention to r/fitness and 5 minutes of Google taught me about health, in a nice outline format:
* Eat a controlled amount of calories.
    * There are several different ways to find out the “right amount” for you. Googling “calorie budget calculator” pulls up decent results.
    * If you want to weigh less, eat ~10-20% less calories than your maintenance level. If you want to weigh more, eat ~10-20% more.
    * My daily “maintenance” caloric budget is somewhere around 3000 calories/day based off 3 of those 4 calculators. Just a fun fact there.
* Exercise at least 3 times a week. 5 is better.
    * For most people (including women!) it’s best to do a mix of cardiovascular and weight training.
        * Cardio: Running, Swimming, Playing Sports, etc.
        * Body Weight Training: Pushups, Pullups, Lunges, Burpees, etc.
        * Weight Lifting: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Presses, etc.
* Sleep regularly.
    * Anywhere between 6 and 8 hours is normal. I shoot for 7 ½.
* Drink water.
    * How much water? More than you are currently drinking.
    * I shoot for 3 liters a day, and generally manage to hit that number. That’s 3 Nalgenes/day.
    * Again, Googling "water intake calculator" works great.
* ???
* Profit.

This all coming from the guy who hasn’t gotten up to weightlift ONCE this week. I’m worthless. I did workout Monday and today (Thursday) after work, though. I’m not totally worthless. I have to work off that double salad with a pound of chicken.

I ate healthy-ish today. I had a chicken ceasar salad for lunch. More specifically: A pound of chicken breast and a salad mix that's definitely meant for two...

That's the benefit of being 6'8", I guess.

Two healthy habits that I have that I’m really proud of that I think everyone should adopt:
1. Get two decent, refillable water bottles. Keep them full and in the fridge. If you drink all of one bottle, fill it up, put it in the fridge, and take out the other bottle to drink on. Viola, infinite cold water!
2. Fruit smoothies and Greek yogurt. They are both good for you and they are both taste fantastic and are easy to get (smoothies require the magic bullet blender, but it’s totally worth it).

Google and Motorola are teaming up to release something currently dubbed the “X phone”. This is not, according to rumor, a Nexus device. From what I’ve gathered, though it’s going to focus on durability and battery life. I’ve long been of the opinion that cellphones should stop going for “thinness” and instead go for longevity. I would rather have a phone that is 5/8ths an inch thick that can last 2 full days than one that’s 3/4ths an inch thick that can’t last until night time. I don’t think I’m alone in this.

I got my laptop back. The refurbished one that experienced a hardware failure after less than an hour of me using it? They had to replace the hard drive. I’m happy to report that it hasn’t had any massive hardware failure sense! It still full of a bunch of ASUS Bloatware. Tonight I am dedicating a fair portion of my time to getting this thing up to speed with my old one. That is: Video editor. Microsoft Office (much to my chagrin), Google Drive, and all of my personal files. Estimated time to completion: 3 hours. Estimated error in estimation: an additional 3 hours.

The singularity will be cool. If I didn’t get enough nerd cred from the binary joke from before, this sentence should allow me to use that label without reserve.

Now here are several pictures to warrant the "pictures" label:

# Top 5: Making Things Specifically for this Post to Use the 5 Least Used Labels

## 5. Jokes -
Why didn't the skeleton cross the road?
Because he's dead. 
And dead people don't do much.
HA!
(It's late. I needed to be in bed an hour ago.)

## 4. Meta -
The column doesn't talk much about the column. I guess it does often enough to warrant it's own label. 

## 3. Drawings -
![](assets/64-4.jpg)
Answer: 42
A character I came up with in high school. If it weren't so late I would crop the irrelevant white parts out.


## 2. Video -
(editor's note: this video was lost to time.)

## 1. Poetry -
Roses are red.
Violets are violet.
Why would violet's be blue?
I mean, oranges are orange.
Get it together, violets.

# WWDC 2024

Well, it’s that time of year again. Apple’s worldwide developer conference just happened, so I’m immediately back fighting that part of my brain that says “YOU SHOULD GO ALL-IN”. That purist part of me that doesn’t *actually* exist, but really wants to. Person who actually *uses* their iCloud email address. The person with only homepods and Apple TVs. Who’s seen every show on Apple TV+ and uses a Fitness+ membership to workout while listening to Apple Music. Who uses routines to set scenes in their smart Home full of HomeKit-enabled products[^1]. I genuinely think the only thing saving me from this is marriage to someone who’d have to live through the painful transition of throwing out tons of stuff that’s working great, just cause I have the itch to be a purist.

Anyway, here’s Aaron’s take on some stuff Apple talked about.

## iOS 18

You can put your phone icons anywhere. The last visual difference between iPhone and Android is gone. Now iPhone is just a really nice variant of Android OS. The feature merger is complete and all phones are the same now.

I’m most pumped about the ability to **see reminders from *within* the calendar**. It is beyond me how this most basic feature is (or was) missing from Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple’s apps. It should be possible to see tasks and events in your calendar. It's crazy that this isn't table stakes for any serious productivity suite.

New control center looks handy, although we’ve officially hit the level of customization that navigating somebody else's phone will involve reorienting yourself to a new setup.

## iPad OS 18

Has a calculator!

## Watch OS 11

Watch OS is adding a “Vitals” app which functions seemingly identically to my Oura ring. This further confirms that if my Oura ring were to suddenly stop working [^0] I would invest in a $1 silicone ring and an $800 Apple Watch Ultra.

## MacOS Sequoia

Has finally adopted the standard windows management system that every non-Apple operating system has had since Windows 7 - you can easily arrange windows by dragging them to the edges or corners of the screen.

Continuity gaining the ability to see and interact with your entire iPhone from your Mac’s screen is cool. Goes one step towards never needing a phone again. 

## VisionOS 2

I don’t care about this one yet. Although outside of WWDC I've read rumors that Apple is haulting work on the Vision 2 and instead pushing their team to work on the cheaper alternative that supposedly maintains the *visual* fidelity. Sweet.

## Apple Intelligence

Apple is embracing AI finally. Siri is getting much more robust and powerful. I’m antsy to see how this will be implemented specifically, and moreso to see how it’s embraced. People have been using AI for years and years now, even before OpenAI and the advent of LLMs - but this is potentially a new scale of interaction with AI for hundreds of millions of people.

# Revisiting Subscription Service Coverage

Subscriptions are more popular now than they ever were before. Even in the most fervent heyday of magazine subscripts did the average American have more *subscriptions* than they do now. You can subscribe to **all sorts of things**. Music services, TV & Movie streamers, are just the tip of the iceberg at this point. There are always going to be weird one-off edge cases for things (e.g Oura Ring’s new subscription model), but I’m interested as always in the most efficient application of your subscription budget. This often comes by way of *bundles* of subscribed benefits. 

I wrote about this exact topic and made a very similar table back in 2020 in [Column #399](399).

## Subscription Options Table

This feels like it should already exist. Some Google Sheet, maintained by volunteers. A brief Google searching for this hypothetical resource doesn’t exist.

### Observations

- Everything on this list is more expensive than it was in [2020](399).
- Prime is the clear winner overall, here. I played Fallout: New Vegas for free with Prime Gaming.
- Spotify Audiobooks are surprisingly good, many books I’ve had interest in have been on there.
- YouTube Premium not being separable from YouTube Music is super annoying. I don't *want* your music subscription service, but I also don't want ads. Great.
- My typical approach of having Prime, Disney+, and ONE other rotating video service is more-or-less working well
- Apple One is only a deal if you are actually going to subscribe to **all** of those things independently, otherwise a la carte is probably better

## Subscriptions Suck

Here’s a popular opinion: subscriptions suck! Despite the fact that [owning isn’t valuable, using is](https://gillespedia.com/Owning+isn't+Valuable%2C+Using+Is) - it’s really irritating to pay $16 for Netflix cause your kids wanted to watch Mario, only to forget you have it the next day - later realizing you just paid $16 to effectively rent one movie[^2]. 

This going to get into hippy/hipster territory - you don’t *need* **any** subscriptions.

Really.



# Top 5: Non-Subscription Alternatives



## 5. Ad-sponsored content (aka YouTube & Over-the-Air TV)

As a surprise to nobody, YouTube exists. You don't have to pay to use it. Same goes for the radio waves carrying broadcast television in the air around you *right now*. There is 100% something on YouTube you've never seen that is worth your time. The trouble is just finding it. And if you're the "like to have Netflix on in the background" type, I reckon linear programming (aka regular TV) could do the trick. It did the trick for 70 years before streaming took over as the primary means of watching.



## 4. Get a NAS (and Plex)

If storage is your main concern, you should probably already have a Network Attached Storage device. We’ve got 10TB downstairs that we can access from anywhere. Using Google Drive or iCloud is purely for convenience at this point. Bonus: if you have physical media that you can rip-to-digital, you can save them on your NAS and have Plex function like your own private Streaming service. It's complicated to set up and a bit cumbersome, but still a really cool thing that's subscription-free.



## 3. Have Better Hobbies

This is a cop out, but I wanted it in the list somewhere. If your subscriptions are funding a *hobby*, like scrolling through Netflix or whatever... just *find something better to do*. Take up exercising. Read books. Meet friends. Whatever.



## 2. Pay to Rent Movies

You can just *rent* a movie you want to see. If you're not doing a movie every week, it's *probably* going to be cheaper to just pay for the thing *directly* and remove Netflix from the equation. 



## 1. The Local Library

Libraries are crazy to me. I think libraries rock and they are a **massive** good to the public, but also so different from the typical "American" mindset. If the library wasn't already a thing, can you imagine the sales pitch for standing one up? It's essentialy just a commune for books and movies. You never *have* to buy any media ever again. Some cooler libraries are even functioning as makerspaces, or let you check out tools. Your library is amazing and you should go there way more often. If you're lucky, it also has a robust online presence and something like the Libby App. I have read 100s of books through Libby. It's genuinely incredible. There are *also* video streaming services that some libraries offer, although they are typically more "arthouse" style movies - regardless it's content and its there.

# Motto: Save ALL the things!

Due to my geolocational luck, I have recently had the pleasure of signing up for Google Fiber. Due to my extraordinary luck, the 1 terabyte of Google Drive storage offered with the internet service has already started for me. It has become official, I have more cloud storage than I do local storage (if you don't include my external hard drive and myriad of flash drives). With that, came a new opportunity, which I viewed (almost frustratingly) as a new obligation.

I had to change up my notetaking system. 

A brief history of my notetaking strategies (insert a "and then" between each of these lines):
I used nothing.
I used a physical notebook.
I used Microsoft Word documents.
I used Microsoft OneNote.
I used Evernote. I used Microsoft OneNote.
I used Springpad.
I made a note on all possible systems comparing each, ad nauseam. 
I used Catch.com.
I used Mircosoft Office + Dropbox.
I used Springpad.
I used Evernote.
I wrote about my notetaking frustrations.
I used OneNote & Evernote.
And now:
I use Google Drive + Google Docs & Microsoft Office.
(editor's note from 2020: man this saga kept going)

If you have a terabyte of storage with one service, you use it. To misquote Loki, I am burdened with glorious power. I am fairly certain this will be my last ever iteration of a digital notetaking strategy. I will append this strategy later on, after I get myself a little nerd-organization gift later. I have other things to be spending money on first, though.

When I get my first dog I am naming it Loki, Thor, or Odin. He's going to be small, but not runty. Cute, but not too cute. Something like... I dunno, this. 

As an aside, I just wasted an hour looking at pictures of dogs on the internet. 

I have done redid my Demetri Martin-esque list. I am calling it "The list 2.0" Here's a picture of the list I am carrying around:

![](assets/35-1.jpg)

The list above fits conveniently in a two-by-two square on standard printing paper because I'm awesome. For the record: I did terribly this week, except for Tuesday. Tuesday I did well. Next week I'm going to try to set the high-score.

Soon.

Motto: Details Details Details

  
I sometimes have a tendency to get excited about something, then forget that anything exists beyond that thing. I was excited for my bachelor party on Saturday, then it came and went. I woke up the next day, Sunday, and realized I didn't have to work and I didn't have plans. I had completely forgotten that Sunday was something that existed until I was there. It's weird. I think it's a side effect of my superpowered focus. I can and have on multiple occasions completely zoned in on something for an entire day without stopping to realize I was hungry or I had to pee. Melissa can verify I will forget to eat food if I'm working on a project that really holds my interest. That same situation is applying to the upcoming wedding, I fear. See the Top 5 for the remedy I've put together. We are 11 days out, as of the day I wrote this sentence. I had my bachelor party this weekend. It is one of those things that I thought some about when I was growing up. I wondered what my wife would be like. I wondered what I would look like as an adult. I wondered what my job would be. I wondered what college would be like. I wondered what technology would look like. I wondered what my bachelor party would be like. Today, I can answer most all of those questions: My wife is going to be awesome. Way nicer, smarter, and more beautiful than I ever really anticipated. I knocked it out of the park on this one. I look basically like this:   

[![](assets/168-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H%5Fk6Q8uiT1k/U1h3e4ssbRI/AAAAAAABONE/as0e%5FstgO1c/s1600/IMG%5F20140407%5F201426.jpg)

My job is to manage the administrative and technical aspects of an project related to advertising on TV sent mostly over fiber optic lines. As a kid I would have known what some of those words meant. College was really, really difficult. College was also really, really fun. I was surrounded by people my own age. I had freedom unlike anything I'd ever before known coupled with responsibility unlike anything I'd ever before known. I met a girl. Technology is awesome. I own a mobile internet device, pedometer, flashlight, still camera, video camera, mp3 player, mp4 player, stopwatch, alarm clock, GPS navigation system, portable wifi hotspot, electronic level, scientific calculator, instrument tuner, radio, audio recorder, electronic library, electronic notebook, personal digital assistant, game boy, barometer, USB memory stick, and portable television. I carry all those things with me in one device my right front pocket. It also makes phone calls. My bachelor party was awesome... and kind of maddening. It was awesome in that it was awesome. I got to hang out with several of my best friends for the entire day and do things that we wouldn't normally get to do. It was kind of maddening because there is NO REASON WE COULDN'T NORMALLY BE DOING THOSE THINGS - except for distance. Nothing we did was entirely out of the ordinary. We could do something like that every single week if we lived closer together. The most out of the ordinary thing we did was just spend time together - that shouldn't be out of ordinary. That should be the rule, not the exception. Friends are for seeing, and I need to remember that better. That is the end of my little Q&A section. Fun fact: I strongly considered making "Q&A" where I asked and answered the questions a recurring theme when I started the Column. Post #1 featured a section called "Self-Interview". I ultimately decided against it. I have enough special features for each post. Already. Regarding my bachelor party, I have video of the most out-of-the-ordinary thing we did on that day. Just a fair warning, this is video from a bachelor party, it does get a little graphic, specifically towards the last 5 seconds. If you have children, you may not want to let them watch. 

  
**Top 5: Things I have to Remember Exist Beyond 05/03/2014** 5\. The honeymoon. 4\. Legalities & formalities in paperwork - updating insurances and what-not. 3\. Mid term projects. 2\. Graduate school. 1\. Being successful in marriage and life.

**Thor Odinson Gillespie: 09/01/2013-02/05/2014.**

  
[![](assets/139-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fZgAkyISlwM/UvPbIKpGhqI/AAAAAAABIXo/lHbPZi2H1lg/s1600/P1040153.JPG)

  
Yes, that was his name - and yesterday Melissa and I had to take him to see the vet for last time.

  
October 13th, just 3 months and 24 days ago, Melissa and I walked into a pet rescue/adoption center to look at their kittens. My heart grew three sizes that day. "two or none" I said to Melissa, and she immediately picked out a beautiful, dark kitten from a cage in the corner of the room. We called her "Loki", and I set out to find her a proper brother. I stared into a large cage on the opposite side of the room and watched a half dozen little golden kittens play for 20 minutes. One particular little guy saw me kneeling outside the cage, eye level with him, and got curious. He walked over to the wall of the cage and begged me to play. I opened his cage, picked him up, and gave him a name.  
  
He was 5 weeks old.  

  
[![](assets/139-2.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0%5F0CAxN9RHQ/UvPbIA85p7I/AAAAAAABIXw/k7eiIV3ZREI/s1600/IMG%5F20131013%5F211904.jpg)

  
We took Thor and Loki back to their new home and they took to their roles perfectly. Loki won over the affection of the authorities while Thor was busy exploring and fighting the claw of the weird beast that lay on the other side of the door. I took this as a good sign. I wanted Thor to knock Moose down a peg or two. It was another good sign that Thor was constantly practicing his craft.  
  
[![](assets/139-3.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jtLjFycf9Wc/UvPlCm31E7I/AAAAAAABIYE/hdyAVNHC73c/s1600/IMG%5F20131017%5F164607.jpg)\\

  
The next 3 months were perfect. Thor and Loki played all day when there wasn't anyone there to keep them company. Moose and Thor grew to be friends - much to my chagrin. More importantly, though, Loki and Thor grew to be brother and sister.   
  
[![](assets/139-4.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nTsbnZg3n3o/UvPbIsLCj%5FI/AAAAAAABIX0/z2n2fgeWeAM/s1600/P1040237.JPG)

  
I am not a cat person. I don't love "cats", in general... but I do love a couple of cats - and of the two of them, Thor was always my little guy.  
  
[![](assets/139-5.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UPXN4W7Ltm0/UvPbH9BF9tI/AAAAAAABIXg/eSi80e86GZw/s1600/IMG%5F20131014%5F071714.jpg)

  
Around a month ago, Thor's body began changing dramatically. At first, we thought he was just eating like a champion; but it soon became obvious that something was wrong. Melissa took him in to see the vet over her day off.

  
It's never a good sign to walk into a room to find someone crying.

  
Feline Infectious Peritonitis is a virus that affects 1 in 5000 cats. It's not curable, it's fatal, and it's nobody's fault. It's just a thing that happens.  
  
[![](assets/139-6.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d5gM2KD7mHs/UvPu9Eub0VI/AAAAAAABIaQ/TyCeNHUqTgo/s1600/IMG%5F20140201%5F202903.jpg)

  
The past month was difficult. We knew what was going to happen, but I'm not sure that made it any easier. Thor slowly grew bigger and bigger and became capable of less and less. About a week ago, he quit playing. Two days ago, he quit eating.  
  
Just before we left to see the vet, Loki groomed him. She hadn't done that for a while. I don't think she knew what was going on with him or how to react, but it seemed like she knew it was going to be her last chance. Moose walked near Thor as we were getting ready. Thor, who had been completely immobile and uninterested with the world, reached out and grabbed his tail as he walked by. He pulled Moose's tail under his head and used it as a pillow. The last thing he did in his home was show Moose who's boss.   
  
I love my little guy.  
  
Melissa and I were both there to say goodbye and see Thor off as he made his transition from this life to whatever happens next. He passed away with his paw in my hand, while Melissa scratched his head just like he liked.  
  
[![](assets/139-7.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eoiAl5gI%5FgY/UvPy%5FI0BHhI/AAAAAAABIag/XpJ5-lBq6GU/s1600/IMG%5F20140205%5F113308.jpg)

  
His life was much too short... we will have to take solace knowing we gave him the best one we could while we had him.  
  
We're going to miss you, buddy.

Motto: Dirigibles and Didgeridoos have Nothing in Common Other than They are both Plural Nouns and Long, Funny "D" Words

  
Bitcoin is weird. I assume anyone who's reading this is at least aware of Bitcoin as a thing, so I'm not going to explain what it is. I have no Bitcoin. I never bought in. The whole concept is... it's just insane to me. It's like a stock for a company that never existed, never made anything, that can pay no dividends. I mean, stocks as a whole barely make sense to me - but this is a whole new level of WHAT? 

  
From my admittedly limited understanding, you "mine" Bitcoin by telling your computer to do some crazy math. Your computer does that math and spits out a new Bitcoin. As time goes on the math gets harder to accomplish and thus Bitcoin become harder to produce. 

  
Meanwhile, everyone who has _any_ Bitcoin at all has their name on this ledger that says "Jack has 2 Bitcoin, Jill has 3". If Jack wants to give Jill Bitcoin to help her pay for those medical bills she received as a result of her coming tumbling after, Jack enters into the ledger "hey I want to give 1 Bitcoin to Jill." At that point, Jack's computer sends out that message to everybody else's computer, everybody else's computer agrees "okay now we'll say Jack has 1 Bitcoin and Jill has 4."

  
The only thing is, Jack didn't give Jill anything. I mean, not really. Nothing physical happened, for sure... and relegating our scope of concern to the virtual world - Jack STILL didn't really do anything in a broad sense. He caused a made-up number on a list next to Jill's name to go up by one. This will enable Jill to give somebody else a made-up number increase. That's it.

  
If you decided you didn't care what that number next your name was on all of these copies of this ledger... then this holds no value. Inherently there _is_ zero value in having a big number next to your name. Doing these math calculations (so far as I know) doesn't accomplish anything for anyone. It doesn't better science. It doesn't help us cure cancer. (If I'm wrong about that, then all this is out the window I guess.) The ONLY reason we give it value is because enough people decided they were willing to spend money to have the number next to their name go up.

  
We exist in a world where some websites have decided that, rather than make money by selling space to advertisers to show us visitors things advertisers want us to see... they utilize some of the spare compute cycles of us visitors to mine Bitcoin for them. 

**This is crazy to me.** It's crazy to me how abstract the concept of this all is. A website is utilizing a bunch of computers to accomplish math tasks that does nobody any good, so they can have a number next to their name on this big list go up... a number that only has value because some people decided they'd be willing to pay to have a big number of their own.

  
Cool - time to talk about Android development. 

  
I finished the Udacity course curriculum that would have garnered me an "Android Basics Nanodegree" had I elected to pay them for such a thing. I previously did the same thing with the "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree". Accomplishing these things has certainly made me a better coder. The core concepts that I've pulled out I've been able to implement in my own projects both for funsies and at work.

  
THAT SAID - man Android development is a drag. It's long and slow and tedious to pick up on. The object model is vast and complex and very intimidating. Just accomplishing simple, easy things requires writing a ton of lines of code, invoking all sorts of concepts and models and other garbage that I'd prefer to not have to deal with. The metaphor I used to describe it to Melissa was imagine the problem of having to stand up out of a chair to walk to the bathroom to pee. Okay if you're approaching this problem in Android you have to write methods to stand up out of not just the chair you're in, but any chair in the world... and you can't just _walk_ to the bathroom, you gotta stretch for 10 minutes, put on your best walking shoes, then draw up a map of how to get from your chair to the bathroom. Meanwhile all I can think is "dude I'm just trying to go pee here."

  
I am going to continue to push myself to get accustomed to it with the ultimate goal of producing a shareable, good version of "The Life Tracker", probably under a better name (currently I'm developing under the name "Captain's Log"... but who knows if I'll stick with that). The onset here has been very frustrating - just trying to do something as simple as "make the text not go behind the headerbar" took me 45 minutes of Googling to accomplish. It seems like something I should have been able to just... click and drag a box to do.

  
Anyway, the current mockup is this:

That view isn't perfectly representative of what I'm going for, but it's a start.

  
Okay enough of that. It's Marvel review time.

  
**BLACK PANTHER NONSPOILER REVIEW**

It was good. In terms of story telling, acting, and effects wasn't the absolutely pinnacle Marvel movie that everyone is saying it is - but it was a very solid entry to the franchise. I'm _very_ glad that superheroes don't all have to look like me. I sincerely hope that more people find representation in the heroes that make up our cultural zeitgeist. Kids of all cultures, races, and genders shouldn't have to aspire to be like the white, male protagonists of The Avengers, the X-Men, or 4/5ths of the Justice League. 

  
**BLACK PANTHER SPOILER REVIEW**

Things I liked:

* The villains were both very compelling in terms of acting and story
* The score was awesome, Marvel needs more of this
* The world-building of Wakanda was pretty great, I'd like to see more going on there and it makes me very excited that we're probably getting more in Infinity War
* The water fight scenes were both tense and compelling
* The new "spiritual" side of the MCU was an interesting and good addition to the universe
* The story was self-contained enough to be enjoyed without having to see and know everything that came before it - while still enabling those of us who _have_ to pull out just a little extra juicy goodness
* Much of the enjoyment of this movie didn't revolve around the action spectacle, but instead the writing of the characters and the developments of the story

Things I didn't like:

* The CGI was bad in spots - in particular the wall of people above the water fight & the rhinos in the field
* Both of the villains were killed off - Marvel is always in need of more, better villains and to have TWO in one movie die off is a shame
* There are basically no stakes whenever Black Panther is in his suit - he's invincible and can do basically whatever the plot decides he needs to be able to do (admittedly Iron Man has a similar issue with this)
* The suit fight scenes also made the character look weightless, and the lack of contrast in the suit made some of the action scenes hard to decipher
* Combining the above, the final fight was basically a dark, hard-to-follow mess of CGI where both characters seemed simultaneously weightless and invincible, this climactic scene needed to be better and it alone prevents me from including this movie in my Marvel Top-Tier Movie list

**WHAT I'M READING/WHAT I'M GUNNA READ**

What I'm reading is the new Star Trek movies. They aren't really "new" anymore; but they're new to me. They are pretty entertaining!

  
Also I watched Altered Carbon on Netflix. It was a really great, not-like-anything-I've-ever-seen-before show... up until the story took a turn that made it like everything else I'd ever seen. I wish the second half of the season didn't have the development that it did. It made the whole thing so much less interesting. Flashback episodes literally always suck, and this show had a flashback episode that was the delineation between "this is really interesting!" and "ugh! why is this happening? Did it _have_ to be this, really?"

  
**LETTERS, IT'S TIME FOR LETTERS**

I have received no letters. If you understand why I have this section at all, then I like you.

  
Top 5: Best Coding Projects I've Done

5\. The _Original_ Life Tracker - the first iteration of what I've made was quite a feat at the time, I knew nothing about what I was doing and trying to figure out how to solve problems to build this is what started me on the path that lead to where I'm at today.  
4\. A Sudoku Solver in Excel - the very thing that made me switch from Computer Science to Electrical Engineering at KU. I blame KU's Computer Science professors for relying too heavily on theory, too heavily on "okay modify this text file"-type homework, and not providing enough guidance on troubleshooting techniques. Also their advisers did me zero favors. I could write an entire post about my misgivings with my college education, actually.  
3\. An old work-related project that very efficiently did comparisons between complex objects and created well-formatted reports to tell people what's up.  
2\. My current work-related project that should make everyone's lives much easier - slowly becoming the best thing I've done.  
1\. The Life Tracker - still probably the best thing I've done.

Motto: Hi guys!  
  
I had a week vacation. Although I went into the week with some loosely-defined goals & objectives, when it came time to put the wheels on the pavement my body, brain, and soul told me no. Full stop.  
  
I stopped writing. I stopped tracking life metrics. I stopped basically everything (other than filming a second-a-day, but that hardly counts). I played videogames, watched TV, and even read some. I worked out at a retail gym with a buddy. I helped Melissa with schoolwork from time to time. Mostly though, I just took it easy. That's what I realized I needed. I'm glad I did what I did with that time.   
  
Things are going to be different now that my vacation is over. I'm going to have a lot less time to do the things I do... and I do a lot of "me" things (see the Top 5). I think that I probably won't be able to sustain all of those activities going into the future. I don't know which of them I'll end up nixing, but I'm about 90% confident that at least one of them is going to go shortly.   
  
There is a whole host of things I have wanted to write about in the past three weeks where I haven't written. Here are miniature versions of those things:  
  
**Raspberry Pis** are cool. Evidence:  
* I got the Emulation Station up and running in about an hour. I've played through Super Mario Bros 3 and most all of Super Mario 64 on it. I plan to play some non-Mario games at some point, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Shout out to Krista for helping me beat Super Mario Bros 3 for the first time ever. She's cool.
* I turned my _other_ Raspberry Pi into a web server. I copied one of my Udacity courses homework assignments over to it; was able to see some JavaScript I wrote, running on a Raspberry Pi across my local network using my Chromebook. That took all of 20 minutes.

Marvel's **Jessica Jones** was great. I binged on the whole thing in two sessions, essentially. I really enjoyed how distinct the show felt from the other Marvel properties. It was similarly different, like the other Marvel Netflix show.  
  
I bought **Fallout 4** and it is ridiculous. It's an open-world post-apocalyptic shooter set in Boston, in the future of an alternate timeline. The game is so dense. You cannot run through it. It's impossible. Trying to sprint through the game is like trying to swim in syrup. It takes a lot longer than you'd expect, and is really sweet. It was probably **70%** of the reason my vacation turned into "Vacation: Full Stop".  
  
**Lifting weights** at Gold's Gym was interesting. It was really clean, not at all crowded, and overall really nice. If it were a little cheaper, I'd consider signing up for a membership. The coolest part of the whole thing, though was working out with my friend. Doing his workout was refreshing... and effective. I might still be a little sore from a week ago.  
  
My two **basketball leagues** came to a close last week. We got 3rd in one, 4th in the other. I'm in fairly good spirits about the performance of both our teams. We won pretty much every game we should have won. We got better throughout the season(s). I got better. Overall, pretty solid.  
  
XKCD creator and author **Randal Munroe's [new book](http://www.amazon.com/Thing-Explainer-Complicated-Stuff-Simple/dp/0544668251/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?ie=UTF8&qid=1448670181&sr=8-1&keywords=thing+explainer)** came out. It's a bunch of blueprints for complicated things, explained using only the 1000 most commonly-used words in the English language. [Like this](https://xkcd.com/1133/)! It inspired me to write [this Column](http://www.aarongilly.com/266) a while back. It's very entertaining and worth a read (the book, but hopefully also that Column, too).  
  
The trailer for **Captain America: Civil War** is out. I have actually read the novelization of the Civil War story, so for the first time I'll be able to judge how the adaptation of a storyline is working. Based off the trailer, it looks like it's going to be a very different story - also based off the trailer, it looks INCREDIBLE. I AM SO EXCITED. WATCH THIS:  
  
  
YES.

  
Melissa and I **ran a 5K** around the WW2 memorial in Kansas City. It was cool. We managed to actually _run_ the whole time, too. That wasn't something either of us anticipated. After we finished, we went back down to the start of the race to take some pictures - because it was a beautiful site... and I just happen to have a phone with a decent camera for the first time. I took a picture!

That picture isn't a good representation of the view, or what my camera is capable of... but it will do.  
  
I went to a discussion featuring **The Woz**. That was cool. It wasn't really aimed at me, but still, cool.  
  
The University of Kansas demoed **McCollum Hall** \- where I lived for 3 years, met my wife, worked for 2 years, had engagement photos taken, met some of my very best friends, and generally had a great time. I wasn't able to attend the demolition, which is maybe a good thing. The people in the video cheered - I felt a little more like crying. I guess it being gone doesn't change what it was to me. It was KU. It was home. It was a part of my life.

Motto: Opportunity Missed  
  
Remember how I said I want to write a book, and how I might dump stuff on here that's from the book? This is counting.  
  
---
-------------------- start snippet
---
-------------------- 

## [1.1 Counting](https://www.blogger.com/null)

Counting is the most important thing you'll ever learn in school. Everything in math is goes back to counting. Everything in physics we describe in terms of math, which goes back to counting. Everything in chemistry is attributable to physics, which is described in terms of math, which goes back to counting. Biology is just applied chemistry. Sociology is just applied biology. All of it goes back to counting. Counting is a fundamental element of science. We count using numbers.

| 0    | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4    | 5    | 6   | 7     | 8     | 9    |
| ---- | --- | --- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Zero | One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight | Nine |

Those are our numbers. They go in that order. Numbers often represent quantities of stuff. Here's what numbers and quantities look like, using ducks:

[![](assets/365-1.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XuKsGf4AkiA/XJVlSdJJ8-I/AAAAAAADtTQ/dPDOat61wOYflkZyO-S-bb2b5fllHuvWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Capture.PNG)

Each line of ducks has one more duck then the line before it because each number is one bigger than the number before it. The first number is zero. Zero means you have no ducks. Zero is a strange concept that comes into play when you want to count numbers bigger than nine. 

We decided we didn't want to have more unique symbols to represent numbers than we have fingers on both our hands. Luckily, we figured out a way to count higher than 9 using only the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9\. Once you count up to 9, instead of going higher, you go back to 0, but you put a "1" next to the zero to make "10". 

  
[![](assets/365-2.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7HvcI7Ejx8s/XJVmVgrRhKI/AAAAAAADtTo/GtmloAxZIFgMw3HvN8JXab93k6Z3E9vEwCLcBGAs/s1600/Capt3ure.PNG)

We call that number "ten". So the new spot, to the left of the first digit, we call the "tens" position. We name all the number positions after the first number that makes that position go from 0 to 1\. That means when you first start counting, the first time you count up to 9, you've been counting in the _ones_position. Once you count past that 9, you mark a "1" in the _tens_ position. You count again from 0 to 9 in the ones position, then change the tens position to "2" (twenty) to indicate you've counted the digit in the ones position from 0 to 9 two times. Once the tens position number has gone from 0 to 9, you put a "1" in a position to the left of the tens position, to show that you've gone through it.

  
Another way to think about it (either more or less complicated, you choose) is that those positions were always there… they was just a zero before, so you had no reason to write it. Actually _every_ number position we may ever need is always there and always zero… until we count up to it.

[![](assets/365-3.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AHIvxgdomrU/XJVmWYuDWmI/AAAAAAADtUY/aMvilIliXeYcfog9VJWZQunchyirM11hQCEwYBhgL/s1600/eae.PNG)

There's no reason we _have_ to use the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9\. We can count the exact same way just using 0 and 1\. That's how we count inside computers. We call it "binary".

[![](assets/365-4.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HEBcbwQ-8YA/XJVmWpHuYXI/AAAAAAADtUY/D2OcNjf4Eo8fniwzPeFITfCxs0t9eg%5FmgCEwYBhgL/s1600/fea.PNG)

The number of symbols you use before you create the next-higher position is called the "base". In Base 16 ("hexadecimal") the symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. This is _also_ useful for computer, just in a different way. Humans have 10 fingers, so we like to use base 10.  

We like to illustrate the order of the numbers and the space between them using the number line.

| **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| |     |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

The number line is _also_ helpful for illustrating mathematical operations, as you'll see below.

### 1.1.1 Addition & the number line

[![](assets/365-5.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nx9yx0GdOT4/XJVmVjQfJUI/AAAAAAADtUI/M1FQcMQtJeorYxFgihH01WDIXt2BfwN2gCEwYBhgL/s1600/add.PNG)

Make a number line for each term, line them up beginning to end, then count to see how far they go. Addition is just repeated counting.

### 1.1.2 Subtraction & the number line

[![](assets/365-6.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eUiktUJznUs/XJVmXvXCZRI/AAAAAAADtUU/TRY%5FKyiMTNEkRR5FB4OYuWL9AI4W1PgogCEwYBhgL/s1600/sub.PNG)

Like addition, you make a number line for each term, line up their ends. The number line for each number with a minus sign in front of it goes backwards. Then see where they line up. Subtraction is just repeated counting, where sometimes you count in the other direction.

Addition and subtraction are just counting in disguise… and they're not the only ones.   

### 1.1.3 Multiplication & the number line

[![](assets/365-7.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sHBcEDilalw/XJVmXEEY14I/AAAAAAADtUQ/jOV2glu-QsQIEhBeJOwIW9hf1rB7YYmwQCEwYBhgL/s1600/mult.PNG)

  
Multiplication is just repeated addition. You add one number to itself over and over, counting the number of times you do it, until you count to the other number. Then you see where you end up. 

### 1.1.4 Division & the number line

[![](assets/365-8.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hdu4wiBnrd4/XJVmVvHKBTI/AAAAAAADtUM/JMNsmOU-6zUi3ZzjtZvv33dcgXWcD4gVACEwYBhgL/s1600/div.PNG)

Division is _also_ repeated addition. You start with the first number, then add the second number to itself, counting the number of times you do it, until you get to the first number. For division, the answer is the number of times it took adding the second number to reach the first.

### 1.1.5 Exponentiation & the number line

Even exponentiation is counting. Repeated counting is called addition. Repeated addition is called multiplication. Repeated multiplication is called exponentiation. This is more complicated, and you shouldn't expect to understand this until later on in school. To show how it works, we need to use a more complicated color scheme.

Example: 23 \= 8 

| 23 is the same thing as saying                               | 2 x 2 x 2 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1 x 2 x 3 ← the exponent is the number of bases you multiply |           |

To say out loud "23", you say "two raised to the third power". To calculate 2 raised to the 3rd power, you're counting the number of timesyou count the number of times you count to two.

[![](assets/365-9.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2NF28NpEU%5FM/XJVmWSjA%5FmI/AAAAAAADtUY/p3HjW745yUY4CrDJUVi0afvIWrUT9JQVQCEwYBhgL/s1600/exp.PNG)

There are other mathematical operations (e.g. logarithms). They all boil back down to fancy counting. We aren't going to show any more of them because it gets really hard to show in a single page why that fact is true - and by the time you learn them, you won't need to use the number line.

---
-------------------- end snippet ----------------------\- 

  
That's counting. I do NOT plan on being as thorough on everything as I was on counting, but counting is so fundamental to _everything_ I wanted to make sure I covered it well.   
  
Sorry if this Column is boring. I guess if it is to you, then you didn't read this bit. SO THANKS IF YOU DID!  
  
Now, sorry for potentially repeating myself with these Top 5s. My thoughts continue to evolve.  
  
Top 5: Current Thoughts on Why iOS is Better than Android  
5\. I really like the way apps on iOS look and function. Almost every single app I have on both is better on iOS. LastPass and Strong, in particular, are both much better on iOS.  
4\. The voice-to-text dictation on the iOS keyboard is nice. I don't like Google guessing when I'm finished with my message. It makes me feel rushed, which causes me to make mistakes.  
3\. Face ID is really neat. Nowadays when I pick up Android phone I always just look at it and expect it to open up.  
2\. The iPhone hardware on this XS is better than any Android phone I've seen  
1\. The OS and apps work without hitch or hiccough 99.9% of the time. Stuttering and slowdowns still don't happen.  
  
Top 5: Current Thoughts on Why Android is Better than iOS  
5\. There are a few apps on Android that have no good iOS equivalent that I've found.  
4\. Android's NFC access to developers has made some things in my life better. I can get photos off my DSLR by tapping my phone to the camera. It instantly connects the two.   
3\. The iPhone homescreen is flat out worse. Having to put useless apps at the top of the screen to push the apps I actually want to use down toward my thumbs is so dumb.  
2\. The car experience with Android is so, so much better.  
1\. Android integrates with MY life better. The Life Tracker gets data from Google Fit. It won't work with Apple Health unless I develop my own app, even then it won't be as simple as it is just grabbing the data from the internet.

Motto: Part 3/3 was a 3/10 in my book.

  
The following is a rant about "Part" movies, and a ranting review of "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies". It will contain spoilers for that movie. I hate "part" movies. They are money grabs that rob the movie-goer of their cash and the chance to experience a story as it was meant to be told. Here's a little background to preface this review: 1\. I'm only a casual fan of the whole "J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth" franchise. I've seen all the movies, but read none of the books. My wife is much more dedicated and her opinion deserves to be listened to more than my own... but I'm only going to write about mine. 2\. I have not done any research beyond watching the films - this includes reading about the lingering questions I have about the film and/or reading previews, reviews, or otherwise anyone else's opinions on it.  
First off, having the word "The" three times in your movie's title is weird. Is it about "the hobbit", "the battle", or "the five armies"? ...and don't say "all of that", because I've seen it. It's not really much about ANY of that. It's about the main dwarf leader dude. He's pretty much the only character with any depth. I learned in film school about flat characters. They exist as a supplement to round characters. Round characters are usually the main characters of any story, they undergo some sort of change during the course of the narrative. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies only has one "round" character, and it's not Bilbo Baggins. It's the leader of the dwarves. So calling the movie "The Hobbit" is kind of misleading. It would be like calling Harry Potter movie "Ron Weasley: and the Story About Someone Else". So there's criticisms 1 & 2\. I walked into the movie and had to ask Melissa, "Hey, what's the point of all this again? I know they are on a quest for something, but what was that something?" It's _probably not a good thing_ that I had to ask that. Sure, it falls back on me somewhat as an audience member to come into the story prepared, but I think it speaks to the lack of a consistent and cohesive story in the two movies leading up to the climax. They were muddled with side plots that got tons of screen time, because how else are you going to make a \~300 book into 8 hours of movie. So the movie starts with Smaug tearing up the water town. Then, within the first 10 or 15 minutes of the film, he dies. I have a huge, gigantic, big big problem with this - and it makes me like the second movie in the trilogy less: **WHY WAS SMAUG NOT KILLED IN "THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG"**. The second movie should be called "The Hobbit: The Final Part of the Journey to Smaug and then Meeting Him and Seeing How Scary He Is and Then Nothing", because he's most CERTAINLY NOT Desolated in that movie. He's made up to be a big scary monster. Then he flies off to terrorize water town. Then the screen goes black. Back in the day when I saw The Desolation of Smaug I thought to myself "oh, actually killing him must be a large part of the 3rd movie." But it's not. He's "desolated" **in the first 15 minutes of the 3rd movie**. Why oh **WHY** would they choose to put the break between the two movies right there? It's a HORRIBLE place to end the second movie and it's a horrible start to the 3rd. Here's why: They needed people to watch Part 3... and killing Smaug pretty much seems like it wraps up the whole story, doesn't it? Even in retrospect, it seems like it wraps up the whole story. What happens afterwards has nothing to do with the Hobbit. It really feels more like a sequel that decides to focus on a different character (which, by the way, I'd be _fine_ with).   

[![](assets/225-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yu3hlb01KHw/VKQmaWbbYEI/AAAAAAABjLs/fMJamNr6hSU/s1600/%23225%2B-%2Bthe-hobbit-battle-of-the-five-armies.jpg)

  
That picture is a horribly misleading advert.  
So, after that 15 minutes, the movie shifts tone and pacing. It basically becomes a whole different story. Smaug had a gigantic pile of treasure, some of which was not stolen from the dwarves, but instead the elves, or other people. So who gets that treasure? The head dwarf guy basically decides he deserves it all (because he has "dragon sickness", a thing that apparently makes you corrupt and have a really cool voice). That question sparks the battle of the five armies. The five armies, by the way, include the dwarves, mankind, the elves, the orcs, and... well... the _other orcs_? I guess? So it's 5 armies, 4 factions. That's confusing. I am a large fan of Evangeline Lily. She's beautiful. She's actually pretty funny in real life, She was a major player in LOST, which I very much liked. She's going to have a big role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in about 9 months. I liked her character in this trilogy. BUT her character either "didn't exist" or "was not a big part of" the Hobbit book (according to Melissa). So, that whole thing was made up by Hollywood to accomplish a few things: A) Give the movie ONE female character. B) Kill time, because how else are you going to make a \~300 book into 8 hours of movie. C) Insert a Romeo & Juliet style love plot into a movie that has nothing to do with romantic love. That's annoying. Speaking of stupid side stories and characters with worthless and unnecessary amounts of screen time... the Mayor/King/Whatever of Water Town's assistant. The guy with the unibrow. We get it, he's a terrible person, has zero redeeming qualities, and is all-around the opposite of the "virtuous man" that most the other characters in the movie are. He does NOT need that much screen time. I'm not sure if they were going for comic relief with that or what, but it just came across as irritating. He's the Jar Jar Binks of the movie. That Jar Jar Binks comparison is actually really good, now that I'm thinking about it. There were apparently several other characters from "The Lord of the Rings" whose appearance in "The Hobbit" was done only in the movie. Legolas, for example. I think I heard that the whole scene with Sauron was not from the book, either. So, those are my problems with that movie in particular. Before I wrap this up I just want to point out one thing. The whole "The Hobbit" trilogy (a.k.a. single book) could be made into one, very very enjoyable movie. It could NOT, however, be done by just concatenating all 3 movies into one 8 hour, 31 minute movie. You would have to cut, slice, and dice all of the movies. Take out the cruft, the crap, the garbage plotlines and 2nd and 3rd "establishing shots" for each scene change. Tighten up the super long pauses between actual dialog. Remove the love story almost entirely. Remove Mr. Unibrow entirely. Take out the long soft-open they did in the first Hobbit movie and the soft close they did at the conclusion of the trilogy. It would be a **lot** of work. But I think it's possible. It's too bad that it wasn't MADE THAT WAY. Hollywood was stolen the opportunity to see one, truly good movie from us, the consumers. They stole that from us WHILE they were stealing our money for the second and third tickets we had to buy. "Part" movies are terrible. Money taking presidency over story is sad. I can't wait for The Avengers: Infinity War Part 1.

  
**Top 5: Redeeming Qualities of the Movie** 5\. I like Martin Freeman. His performance was very enjoyable. 4\. The visuals in the movie were quite impressive. 3\. I like Evangeline Lily in everything she's in. 2\. I like that the movie was done in 60 Frames Per Second. I wish all movies were done this way. It makes motion so so much better. 1\. Smaug was cool (for the 15 minutes of the movie he was in).

This Wednesday (8/12/2020) was the series finale of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. If you've never watched the show, which frankly is all of you (except maybe ~2?) just go ahead and skip riiiight down to that Top 5 and quote. They aren't related.

The debut of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC back in 2013 was tied in with probably my highest Marvel Cinematic Universe hype. This was back when I was making spreadsheets to track the in-continuity storyline. This was back when I bugged my fiancé about superhero shows incessantly. Believe it or not, things are actually very different now... but this Column isn't about now, it's about S.H.I.E.L.D., and my relationship to it.

# A Multi-Platform Universe  
The concept that came with this show was one of a television show that closely tied in with a series of movies, in real time. They were to play off each other, storylines weaving back and forth between them. For the first couple of seasons, that was still (essentially) the promise. Sometime around the introduction of the Netflix, it started to dawn on me... "it's all connected" had a huge asterisk.

> It's All Connected*
> 
> *to the movies. Also the platforms will never recognize the existence of the other platforms. The ABC shows will never reference the Netflix shows. The Hulu shows will never reference ABC or Netflix. Netflix will never reference ABC or Hulu. 

It was somewhere around this realization that I sort of "gave up" on caring *too much* about Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., or Daredevil/Jessica Jones/Luke Cage/Iron Fist/The Defenders/The Punisher on Netflix, or The Runaways/Cloak and Dagger on Hulu.

That dotted line between Agent Carter and the Avengers movies is Edwin Jarvis. The actor that was cast to play him in Agent Carter DID show up and have one speaking line in Avengers: Endgame.

I want to see a graphic like that, but more detailed. All 23 movies and all 29 season TV shows, with arrows between them representing direct references. Something more substantial than a throwaway line. Nothing in Doctor Strange cares about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, for example. Maybe I'll work on this in my spare time at some point. I've only seen 25 of those 29 seasons.

It LOOKS like the Disney+ shows are going to be first-class citizens of the MCU. I read somewhere that Kevin Feige outright said that plotlines from the shows will be addressed in later movies. So maybe I'll be on board for those.

# Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Major Story Arcs
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was a dense show. One thing I always appreciated about it was how quickly they moved on. Things other shows would turn into an entire season tended to be 3 to 6 episode arcs. There were so many, I think I've forgotten about most of them.

## Season 1

- **Monster of the week phase**. The show started with a dozen episodes that boiled down to a "monster of the week". It was chore to get through, but worthwhile.
- **Project Centipede**. Hard meh.
- **Who is the clairvoyant?** This bit was alright, it was the first major serial storyline. 
- **How did Coulson come back to life?** It was very interesting (this time) T.A.H.I.T.I. is a magical place.
- **Who is Hydra, who is S.H.I.E.L.D.?** This was awesome.
- **Coulson is drawing mysterious symbols**. Sure.
- **Garett is the new Dethlock**. Meh.

## Season 2  
- **Hunter and Bobbi are a thing**. Ugh I miss them.
- **Fitz has a broken brain**. Bummer to watch. First moments where we learn Iain De Caestecker is the best actor on the show.
- **The Absorbing Man**. He was good - but underutilized.
- **Daniel Whitehall** is looking to steal Inhuman abilities.
- **Can Ward be redeemed?** Interesting. A worthwhile storyline. Ultimately they made the right call.
- **Who are Skye's parents?** Meh. The answer was pretty alright, actually.
- **Skye and Raina get superpowers.** That was super exciting at the time.
- **Afterlife, the inhuman sanctuary.** Sort of a slow down. Some good character stuff with Skye... but also the introduction of Lincoln.
- **Lincoln**. Terrible. Not a good character. Not a direction the series needed to go. Skye crying about boys is not interesting or fun.
- **Jaiying wants to turn the whole world inhuman.** Completely forgot about this.
- **Coulson's robot hand.** Nice.

## Season 3
- **What happened to Simmons when she got sucked into the big alien rock?** This was resolved in a few episodes, which I appreciated. It also had probably the most interesting episode ever, the offworld "let's see what happened to Jemma" episode. Remember when she fell in love with some other dude? That happened!
- **There's Terrigen in Fish Oil pills!** This was very exciting. It sort of got forgotten about quickly, though.
- **Yoyo is bad, then good.** Yoyo was fine. She was never given anything interesting to do, really.
- **May's ex-husband is huge Inhuman-hunting Inhuman monster**. Not bad.
- **What's the Monster on the planet that Simmons was stuck on?** This one had huge implications in the lore, but the whole "Hydra is actually a secret religion for an Inhuman monster that was banished to another planet" thing is definitely never getting brought back up. Hive is a zombie-making monster.
- **Ward is Hive now**. Sure. Glad to see Brett Dalton given more to do.
- **Ward is going to make the whole world Inhuman?** I have zero recollection of this.
- **Who is going to be in the Quinjet when it explodes?"** This was a well-done TV Mystery. And it was great to get rid of Lincoln. Dude sucked.

## Season 4
- **The new S.H.I.E.L.D. directory, Jeffrey Mase, what's his deal? He good?** This was really well done. That character was very well written, the actor did a stellar job. Such a great character, in retrospect.
- **The Watchdogs are racist against Inhumans.** I forgot about this. They aren't overly utilized.
- **Skye/Daisy goes goth for a bit.** Meh.
- **There are ghosts. Literally ghosts.** Such a left turn. Turned out it was more about an evil book, the Darkhold, though.
- **Ghost Rider is a ghost hunter.** Awesome. The introduction of the Spirit of Vengance and what they did with it were both so well done.
- **Daniel Ratcliffe helps S.H.I.E.L.D.** I sort of forgot about this nuance. This is where Aida reads the Darkhold, which is what caused the whole subsequent slide into evil. This season really is the best one.
- **Life Model Decoys are invented by Daniel Radcliffe and Fitz.**. Yes. Get pumped.
- **The Superior. The Russian Watchdogs leader.** He was an alright character. He gets lost in the other parts of the season. I like how he wound up becoming a robot, which he hated so much. That reveal was cool.
- **Slowly, we realize that the team has been replaced with L.M.D.s... who's real?** This was the beginning of the best part of the show. This part has by far and away the best episode of the series, season 4 episode 15, "Self Control".
- **Everyone is put into "The Framework".** This continued the incredibly interesting and well done "who can we trust" storyline with a incredibly interesting and well done "what's the new world like" storyline. Season 4 is easily the best season. this is the best part of the best season. This show will be fondly remembered largely because of the heavy lifting from the back half of Season 4.
- **S.H.I.E.L.D. has been replaced by Hydra.**** Yes. Fitz leads it? Double yes. The whole thing was orchestrated by Aida who has a sort of weird robo-crush of Fitz? Dude.
- **WARD IS BACK... AND SECRETLY S.H.I.E.L.D.** YES. SO HARD YES. THIS WAS THE BEST THING THIS SHOW EVER DID.
- **Mack wants to stay in the Framework.** Again, this is the best writing in the show.
- **Aida is a real girl... but with all the powers. And Ghost Rider is the only person who can stop her.** This I forgot about. There's a tiny lull right before the last episode of the season.
- **Boom. Coulson took on the spirit of vengeance to kill Aida, and sacrificed himself in the process.** This was such an awesome reveal. And a fitting end for Coulson.

## Season 5
- **S.H.I.E.L.D. in Spaaaaace!**"**. I was so high on the show at this point... it's a bummer this wound up sucking so hard.
- **The introduction of Deke.** Weird that one of my favorite characters in the show was introduced at the same time the show started sucking.
- **S.H.I.E.L.D. are actually in the future and possibly Daisy ruined the earth?** Could have been interesting. 
- **Kasius, the new big bad.** This starts a trend of terrible villains that plague the show for the rest of its life. He was probably the worst one. This was uninteresting, unfun, and the beginning of me dropping from "huge fan, no reservations" to a "you just gotta appreciate it for what it is" status.
- **The Introduction of Chronicoms & Enoch.** I like Enoch. I hate the Chronicoms. I forgot they were introduced this early.
- **Can we change the future?** Minorly interesting.
- **Deke is sent back to the past.** Great move. Kept a good character.
- **Ruby is the big bad.** Completely forgot about her. 
- **General Talbot is Graviton.** This was mostly fine. Him really wanting to be an Avenger and fight Thanos was pretty solid.
- **Quake fights Talbot.** She never gets even remotely close to this powerful again.
- **Coulson retires to Tahiti to die**. Sure. Would have been an okay end the show. 

## Season 6 
- **Fitz and Enoch are stuck in space.** This was pretty alright.
- **Coulson is Sarge, the new big bad.** Turns out Clark Gregg makes a great bad guy.
- **Alien bats are taking over the world.** Meh.
- **Aizel is also a big bad, the person who Sarge wants to kill.** Aizel sucks. 
- **Coulson and Aizel aren't really enemies, they are the same species and whatnot. Maybe Coulson is in there?**. Meh.
- **The whole ancient Incan temple and portals to another world.** The end of season 6 is forgettable.

## Season 7
- **Simmons from the future comes to take them back to the past.** This set up a fun, if terribly flawed season.
- **Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. time travel through the ages of the MCU.** This was a really fun bit. Set up a lot of niche one-off episodes that were good.
- **The Chronicoms want to take over earth and Fitz is hiding.** The Chronicoms were so dumb. I really want to learn why the best actor in the show wasn't in the vast majority of its final season. Some brief research reveals no explanation. Surely it wasn't just "the best idea they had". That's garbage. It didn't even make sense in the story of the show.
- **The final reveal, Fitz was in the original timeline**. I haven't figured out how any of this makes sense yet. I don't really care. The season had some fun moments. Ultimately, I'm very glad the show is over. It probably went on for 3 more seasons than it should have.

# Final Thoughts
S.H.I.E.L.D. was such a weird show. A mix of really great twists you genuinely didn't see coming tossed in with the most obvious tropes ever. It would bounce back and forth between being genuinely great, and genuinely embarrassing. It was, on the whole, worth the watch. I don't know if I'll ever revisit all 136 It's a shame the trajectory of the show was so inconsistent. 

## The Graphic this Whole Post Lead To  
This was why I wanted to write this post. So I could draw this:

![ratinggraph](assets/396-2.jpg)

The super high rating for the most recent episodes in that underlying graphic ([which is from this super handy website, by the way](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-ratings-45167/) is more of a reflection of the fact it's so new. They will tamper down over time.

Alright. Done with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. forever now.

Motto: Writing about Chrome, in Chrome

  
A couple of months ago I wrote about my change of heart with my Nexus 7\. When I bought the 7 inch tablet, I was using it to supplement the Nexus 4\. The Nexus 7 was (and still is, frankly) a fantastic device for multimedia consumption. It filled that niche perfectly with it's glorious 1080p screen. Then I got the Nexus 5\. Before long, I realized that I wasn't defaulting to my tablet for mobile internet browsing. I picked up my tablet one evening and realized it was the first time I'd touched it in over a week. So I sold it. With the money I made back from the tablet sale, I decided I would buy a Chromebook someday. When I moved, I lost Google Fiber. When I lost Google Fiber, I lost my Google Drive storage. That was the trigger I was waiting for (Chromebooks come with 2 years of Google Drive storage). I'm writing this on a Chromebook. Specifically, the Toshiba Chromebook. Before I get too far, I must admit, I'm waiting on a second Chromebook to come in the mail on Friday. I'm going to compare them and send back the one that doesn't fit me. The Chromebook I'm writing on is much less powerful than my full-blown laptop. It's got 1/3rd the RAM, a fraction of the processing power... but runs Chrome faster. Faster browser = faster internet. Faster internet = faster 95% of what you do on a computer. I thought I'd get the Chromebook and use it in edge cases. I thought I'd be using it really only when I was going out for the weekend, or going to a coffee shop, or needed to browse the internet from the couch... but now that I've got this thing sitting in front of me, I think the opposite is going to be true. I'm only going to use my full-blown laptop in the edge cases that I need to do something outside of the browser. Video editing... that's really it. I really like this thing.  
  
I'm feeling lazy about the picture for this post. So here's a test of the webcam on this with the closest thing there is to me. It's kinda grainy.

Top 5:**Advantages of my Chromebook over my Windows laptop** 5\. It runs Chrome faster, better, and more fluidly. It makes the whole browsing experience way better. 4\. Startup time is reduced... dramatically. I vastly underestimated how much I'd appreciate this fact. 3\. If I were to leave my Chromebook in a library, drop it in the ocean, run it over with a car, or set it on fire, I'd be able to replace it and pick up exactly where I left off. 2\. 8 hour battery life > 2 hour battery life 1\. Google > Microsoft.

Motto: This post started so positive, then went down in flames  
  
I wrote the majority of this post a week ago, but then lost internet connectivity and had to put it on the back burner. I have other stuff to write about, but don't want to make this longer. So, here's one and I'll turn out another one about my 2 Year Anniversary and Breakout KC and Captain America: Civil War here shortly.  
  
I went to LA for work. It was good for work purposes, but also a great time. Helps when you enjoy being around the people you work with. It also helps when the weather is fantastic.  
  
Before that was a fishing trip with some high school buddies. I don't fish very often, but I'd say I fish often enough. I don't see old friends very often, and I'd say that's not often enough.  
  
When I was a kid, in kindergarten or first grade, our teacher had us fill out this sheet of paper with a list of things we wanted to do when we got older. She told as at the time not to write down "professional baseball player" or "be in the NBA". She said those goals were unrealistic and not the kind of thing that could actually happen. I took it to heart.  
  
It was _terrible_ advice.   
  
I grew up to be 6' 8 1/2" tall. That height plus a potential for at least a moderate amount of athleticism could have very well put me in some sort of "paid to play" situation. I don't know which teacher it was that told me that... but it was a very bad message to send to impressionable kids. "BE REALISTIC BECAUSE LIFE SUCKS AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, YOU SUCK". She probably told her daughter "IF YOU AREN'T BORN A PRINCESS THERE'S VERY LITTLE HOPE FOR YOU TO BECOME ONE, LITTLE GIRL."  
  
While I'm ranting here - as of this writing, my internet is fully down. That's something I could rant about, but I'm going to skip past that and focus on the great automated atrocity that is phone tree "hello, I'm an intelligent automated system, in a few words - how can I help you today?"  
  
10 minutes later, after fighting against a robot and getting stuck in a loop 2 times, after being asked if I am calling about billing issues for the 5th time when I only used the words "router, internet, down, support", I am finally greeted with an automated "let's reset your router!"  
  
I DID THAT. EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO RESET A ROUTER. YOU UNPLUG ALL THE STUFF, WAIT, THEN PLUG IT BACK IN. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT. OBVIOUSLY I WOULD DO THAT BEFORE I GO THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE PROCESS. DIALING YOUR SUPPORT NUMBER FILLS ME WITH MORE DREAD THAN GETTING A SHOT USED TO AS A KID.  
  
Caps lock = rage.  
  
If that wasn't insulting enough to my intelligence - the AT&T automated system has undergone and "upgrade" since the last time I called. This one has the audacity to try to pass itself off as a human on the other end. Between voice prompts, it plays typing sounds to make you think that you're talking to a some dude who's actively working on the other end. It is not some dude. It is a machine. Don't lie to me. I'm not 7 years old.  
  
This is equal parts angering and aggravating. It's the perfect storm of Angervation.  
  
Anyway, I'm not going to end this on such a dour note. Here's some photos that will cheer me up.

# Motto: Moving on Up

I am in the process of swapping out Nexus 7's. For those of you who don't know (e.g. most of you reading this) Google recently released an updated version of their seriously awesome Nexus 7 seven inch Android tablet from last year. As soon as I heard about the new version of the tablet, I went on Amazon.com* to list my old one for sale. Long story short, it sold and I immediately bought the new one. Then the buyer cancelled his purchase. So I temporarily have two.

*I like to sell things using Amazon, as opposed to eBay or Craigslist because Amazon makes me feel less likely to get screwed over or murdered in the selling process.

This puts me in a unique position to do a real product review, like the tech bloggers I read every day.

They always talk about "white balance" and "true white". None of it really meant anything to me until I put the two Nexuseses next to each other and pulled up a white webpage. The 2012 model looked much "oranger" than the 2013 model. 

The other reviews talked about how much better the 2013 screen is than the 2012 screen. I thought "how could the screen be better, this one is great." I wasn't wrong, but the 2013 screen is literally the best screen I've ever seen on anything. It's fantastic. I honestly don't know how you could improve on it. Higher PPI wouldn't do you much good. The bump from 720p to 1080p is noticeable (216 to 323 pixels per inch)... anything beyond that wouldn't be on a screen this size. I'm still not convinced 1080p is necessary on a 5 inch screen. Anything beyond 325 ppi is superfluous in my opinion. 

The missing camera on the back of the original model always made sense. Who takes pictures with their tablet, anyway? While I never wanted to do that, I did wish that I could have used it to scan documents. Now I can do that. So that's cool.

It's a hair thinner and lighter. It's a bit faster. But those things haven't really improved the user experience too much. 

I could write more, and I really should, but I'm more excited to write about my vision for the future of the Column - so I'm going to post these pictures I took and call 'er good.

![](assets/116-1.jpg)

![](assets/116-2.jpg)

Now, about the Column, I've got plans. I want to implement some sort of "section" function. Create a place to put videos. Put pictures. You'd still have the normal Blog where I post normal columns... but I want a section for specific things. A place to file feature posts. A repository for project summaries. A section to put files in. 

Basically. I want more control. I want to expand.

Maybe even a place for information about the wedding.

I'm getting married, by the way. I won't have time for all this stuff soon.

Motto: I Like These Oddly Formatted Columns. Expect More of Them.

  
Impressed  
  
Robert Downey Jr. is rumored to be joining the cast of the upcoming Captain America 3 movie (working title). That same rumor says that his involvement will mark the beginning of the MCU adatpation of Marvel's "Civil War" storyline. Here's 20,000 ft overview of the civil war plot:  
  
The government enacts a "superhero registration" act, Iron Man leads a faction of superheroes that are for it, Captain America leads a faction of superheroes against it, the story follows Spiderman in particular whose kind of in the middle of it all.   
  
The Civil War story is big and long and the type of thing that wouldn't take place JUST in Captain America 3, it would take place over several movies. So we're left with several questions:  
  
1\. Are they really doing the Civil War story?   
2\. How faithfully will it be adapted?  
3\. How will it work in movie form? one movie? A whole phase of movies?  
4\. Does Spiderman actually get to be involved or will they put someone in his place?  
5\. WHY CAN'T THIS HAPPEN NOW!  
  
Impressed  
  
Android Lollipop was "announced" yesterday. It was previewed a few months back at Google I/O, so I guess there wasn't much new other than the name. Lollipop features an even bigger focus on aesthetics with the introduction of Material Design. There are new security features, much improved battery life, faster access to notifications and settings, better performance, much improved camera software, and a lot more. It also introduces Android TV, Android Auto, and Android Wear (2.0).  
  
Not Impressed  
  
The Nexus 6 - the newly announced successor to my phone, the Nexus 5.  
  
Rumor has it, this device will start retailing at $650 (unlocked). This is a full $250-$300 MORE expensive than the $350-$400 Nexus 5 was. It's an intentional step AWAY from the "cheap off-contract yet still high quality phone" and into the "premier brand" territory. This move is severely SEVERELY disappointing from a consumer's perspective.   
  
Okay, so, the price sucks. Is it at least worth the extra $250?   
Compared to the Nexus 5:  
\- You'll get 1 inch more screen real estate  
\- A massive jump in the number of total pixels  
\- \~48 more pixels per inch  
\- AMOLED screen, not a typical LCD  
\- An extra 30% bump in battery size  
\- 5 more megapixels per picture, with an improved sensor (I'm guessing on this one)  
\- A newer, faster CPU  
\- A newer GPU  
\- Double the storage  
  
To me: that's not worth it. At all. Check the Top 5 for more on this.  
  
Having said all that, I WOULD like a bigger battery. I WOULD like an improved camera. I DO like AMOLED displays. But, I'm not going to pay $650 for that and I'm definitely never going back on contract.  
  
I'm all for market diversity. It's awesome that this phone is available as an option.. but where is the smaller, cheaper option?  
  
Not Impressed  
  
The Nexus 9 - the newly announced successor to both the Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10.  
  
I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this one. This tablet is basically the same size and shape as a regular old iPad. The aspect ratio is NOT 19x6, as per most Android Tablets of the past. That's not a bad thing, it's just interesting. The screen resolution is 2048x1536... which is exactly the same resolution as the iPad.  
  
It's $500 - not a price I'd consider as "peripheral computing device" territory.  
  
There's a keyboard case that comes separate that could be interesting... but I'm just not sure. If Google is positioning this as a "this can be your only computer if you want!" then that's cool, but I'm not that type of customer.  
  
It's a fine competitor to the iPad Air and Microsoft's Surface 3... but I doubt I'll get one.  
  
I like the smaller, cheaper tablets of yore.  
  
Impressed  
  
The Nexus Player - the first ever Android TV.  
  
I'm impressed with the idea of Android TV. I like the idea of a lightweight videogame console/TV streaming box that supports "Google Cast" (chromecast) functionality. It's basically just a more fully-fledged Chromecast. I'm nervous about the performance. I've heard the original Android TV developer units had some performance issues.  
  
It's $100\. That's not bad, not great. I'd like to get one, but until I can replace my Playstation 3's blu-ray capabilities I don't think I'll be pulling the trigger... but it might make a cool Christmas gift!  
  
Impressed  

  
Apple announced a new, cheaper Mac Mini. At $500, the specs really aren't all that impressive - but they are better than the old Mac Mini and the product is selling for $100 less than it used to. So that's cool.  
  
Not Impressed  

  
The iPad Mini 3 and iPad Air 2\. They are adding the fingerprint-reading "Touch ID" feature, but those should have been there already considering the iPhone 5S had it. The prices stayed the same. They updated the camera in the iPad, but people who use their iPad as a camera are weird. They made the iPad 18% thinner, but at a certain point it doesn't matter anymore. If you're product is under 10mm, it's pretty much thin enough. I'd rather they kept the same thickness and just increased the battery size by 18% (it wouldn't work exactly like that, but it would be close). Or, heck, double the thickness, and double the battery life. Sweet!  
  
Not impressed  

  
The new iMac. It's got a 27" '5K' display, which is crazy awesome. But it's got a price tag starting at $2500, and that's crazy not awesome. Especially considering that's the base model, which doesn't really have "top of the line specs" (although it's way better than anything I own). Getting better specs increases the price quickly.  
  
Interesting  

  
As of the 2014 generation, Google's flagship Nexus lineup no longer undercuts Apple's flagship lineup... at all. They are matched across the board.

  
iPhone 6 = Nexus 6 = $650 unlocked  
iPad Air 2 = Nexus 9 = $500  
Apple TV = Nexus Player = $100  
  
Is Google positioning the Nexus brand as top-tier hardware?  
  
**Impressed**  
  
HBO has announced they will start selling HBO subscriptions to people without cable providers next year. We are one or two steps away from a mass adoption of the cord cutter culture (of which I am a member). If ESPN does something similar, we'll see some MAJOR changes in the television industry... and unfortunately, probably also the internet industry.  
Impressed  
  
Warner Brothers officially announced their movie lineup for 2016-2020\. There will be two justice league-type movies per year for 5 years. They also announced a "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and "Lego Movie" trilogies coming out over that same 5 year span. They are finally showing some amount of forward thinking. Also, they are willing to put their cards on the table. That puts them firmly ahead of Sony's Spiderman franchise which "Will definitely have like, 4 or 5 Spiderman movies" "okay, no, wait, only 3 Spiderman movies, but then 2 or 3 movies focused on villains" "okay, no, wait, only 2 Spiderman movies, but then a movie focused on the female superheros from the Spiderman universe" "okay, no, wait, we're going to re-reboot" "okay, no, wait..."  
  
I Wish  
  
I spend a lot of time thinking about what would be "ideal". I think that an "ideal" offering of flagship devices would require more options. Something like this:  

  
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YzQiguYmddelaf8hpqdVXVs2bXTXv4VlHThB-s0NaDHyApTvrEz3Z1VwmFpPcXQgRk4S6Y5vnF1tvGoF2zANjAMqEfphpr1pSbAI0ue4d0UdSX3BW3C4bw_de7UGAisUCA)

  
That's a small, medium, and large phone with similar pixel densities (a.k.a. "with resolutions that are scaled with the size of the phone"). Then a 16x9 and 4x3 version of what I'd call a "personal" sized tablet and a "full" sized tablet. You cover all the bases. Of course, then you have to maintain 7 product lines year over year... but hey that's their problem to figure out. I'm the idea guy.

  
Top 5: Reasons I Won't Upgrade My Nexus 5 to the Nexus 6  
5\. The extra storage I don't really care about. I'm not using 20 of the 32 gigabytes I have available on my current phone anyway.  
4\. A QHD screen (2560 x 1440) on a phone is insanity. Phones do NOT need to have screen resolutions beyond 1080p. If your PPI is above 325 - you're fine. Apple sells tons of iPhones with a 326 ppi "Retina" display. Honestly, 720p is fine for most phones. There is absolutely no need to have that many pixels to push. Is this really what the consumers want?  
3\. The Nexus 5 hardly ever stutters. I don't really need a faster CPU and GPU. It would be nice, sure, but that power is probably negated by the (worthless) extra 1.6 MILLION pixels you're pushing. The battery will needlessly suffer also thanks to those.  
2\. You're getting a SIX INCH SCREEN. SIX. That's larger than the Galaxy Note "Phablets" and the iPhone 6 Plus. That's out of "Phablet" territory into "full-blown tablet-that-you-happen-to-use-as-your-phone" territory. That's insane. Even a 6'8+" guy says that's insane. Again, is this really what the consumers want?  
1\. THE SCREEN IS SIX INCHES. It's so ridiculous it's on this list twice.

Motto: El Google  
  
Google I/O happened. I had to work during most of the keynote, but it was still fantastic.

  
Here's the changelog:  
  
Material Design is Google's new design direction. It is supposed to give the users a sense that the user interface is made up of physical objects (materials) that act in a physically intuitive way. UI elements slide around in an intuitive and consistent manner. Bold, simple, colorful, intuitive... I think I'm going to be a fan of this new direction.  
  
  
Android everywhere! Seriously. Android for your phone, tablet, wrist, television, car, and even your Chromebook. Let me detail these things in descending order of things I'm excited about:  
  
  
[![](assets/180-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zO9aGifWDYs/U7MQMau4v6I/AAAAAAABZBM/pBmvdqtDls4/s1600/%23180+-+Moto+360.jpg)

  
Android Wear - Android for your wrist. Google has made the first smartwatch that makes sense. The watch relays notifications from your phone. It is a low-barrier of entry into Google Now and Google Voice Actions. It acts as a Bluetooth key into your phone, Chromebook, or whatever else they decide to do down the road. It gives health stats (pedometer, heart rate monitor, etc). And, most importantly, there is a beautiful smartwatch coming later this summer (probably in August). Yes, I'm going to buy a Moto 360 (as pictured above).  
  
  
[![](assets/180-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2JMgG3NQiqQ/U7MQ1QuBrPI/AAAAAAABZBU/Q0evCOWAZLI/s1600/%23180+-+Android+TV.jpg)

  
Android TV - Android for your television. Google TV has been reborn and dubbed "Android TV". It's a platform, not a product. All Sony TVs coming out in 2015 will run Android TV. If you don't want to buy a Sony TV, you will also be able to use a set-top box for the same functionality. What is that functionality? Well, it has Chromecast functionality AND a user interface! Also - it has Apps. Games will be a large part of Android TV. They won't be on the same level as the PlayStation or Xbox, but I don't think many people will care. There are Super Nintendo emulators on Android. I will soon be able to play Super Mario Bros on my TV through my Android TV. Yes, I'm going to buy one (some kind of one).  

[![](assets/180-3.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o6JMz%5FwRB9w/U7MVGNZ24jI/AAAAAAABZBc/q%5FOkTnEYAz0/s1600/%23180+-+Chrome+Android+App.jpg)

  
Android apps on Chrome OS - this was not explained in detail, but Android apps will soon run Chrome. This could be huge... or it could be a gimmick that doesn't work well. Time will tell. The line between Chrome and Android is continuing to blur. Notifications from your phone will pop up on Chrome. It's unclear if you will be able to use Chrome to respond to SMS, but at the very least you'll be able to see notifications of them. That's a step in the right direction. Consider this a mini version of Apple's "Continuity" push from WWDC that I was so impressed with. Yes, I'm going to use this functionality on my Chromebook.

Android is coming to phones and tablets! No way! They kinda sorta announced the next version of Android. I say "kinda sorta" because they didn't give it a proper name or version number. "The L Release" is coming later this year. It brings some new features to Android, but the biggest change it makes is the visual overhaul it will bring. Android will be the first thing out of the gates with Google's new Material Design. Beyond that, there's a new lockscreen, new quick settings, a new camera API, and more. I'm very excited for it. It's not clear when it will all come out or if a new Nexus device will come out alongside it, but hopefully we'll know the answers to those questions sooner rather than later. Yes, I will be getting the Android update on my Nexus 5\. No, I don't plan on buying a new Nexus device... probably.  
  
[![](assets/180-5.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ADM-kR8t0d4/U7MV1UmuPgI/AAAAAAABZBs/Qdo2X9gAuTk/s1600/%23180+-+Android+Auto.jpg)

  
Android Auto - Android for your car. You will plug your phone into your car's USB port, from there your phone will taken over and control your car's onboard infotament screen. This will be coming to cars as early as next year. I'm not as excited about this because I cars don't impress me. No, I will not buy a new car just to get this functionality. My next car MIGHT have it, but... meh.  
  
That's pretty much it.  
  
Google I/O could pretty well be summed up with Material Design and Android everywhere... and it was great. They did announce other things, though. Developery things.  
  
Yes, developer is an adjective.  
  
Google announced a development environment for Chrome. The Android development program of the future went from "developer preview" to a beta. They released a Material Design tool to build Android, Chrome, and Web apps using Material Design direction. I am going to learn to use all of the above. I was waiting until Google I/O to start Android development in anticipation of them announcing this sort of thing. Now is the time.  
  
**BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME**  
  
I wanted to position my main computer for the work I wanted to do with it in the future. That work includes the following:  
  
* Android development
* Video editing
* Photo editing
* Plex media serving
  
I wanted to do all of those things on Linux. Because now is the time, I attempted to make my Windows-only computer into a dual-boot machine over this weekend. I've done that on three separate occasions in the past, all with great success. This weekend, however, did not go as planned. Luckily I backed up all of my files to the cloud and to local external storage, so I'm not out any files. However, I no longer have a Windows fallback to rely on. I kinda sorta accidentally jumped into Linux with both feet.  
  
Oops.  
  
The problem is that I'm going to have to build out My 25th Year second-a-day video from scratch again... while learning a new video editor.  
  
  
I'm actually very optimistic about everything, though.  
  
Top 5: Things I'm Looking Forward to from Google I/O

5\. Getting my first notification from my phone on my wrist. 4\. Using my watch to control my television. 3\. Asking my watch a question and getting a response. 2\. Possibly playing some emulated Super Nintendo on my TV 1\. Wearing the Moto 360\. Have you seen that thing?

Motto: Make Happy  
  
I write the first half of this Column from a position of privilege. Actually I write _every_ Column from that position, now that I think about it. Regardless, this is all very personal and I can say up front that I know it's not this simple, this is all very easy for me to say, and what good does it do? Part of me thought about just deleting this, but heck I wrote it so here it is.  
  
I don't really understand smart people who aren't happy.  
  
If you're smart, you should be able to identify cause and effect relationships. You should be good at noticing patterns and trends. You should have a good idea about what toolsets are available to you and how to use them to create effective change.   
  
Happiness, to me, seems like a key metric that most people are trying to maximize in their lives... and smart people are supposed to be good at tweaking dials to solve problems. Combining those two strongly-held beliefs, it doesn't seem like smart, unhappy people should be common. Why is it that smartest people are some of the most capable of making stupidest life choices?  
  
I feel like I should throw a caveat in here that, although I'm thinking about a couple people I've met in my life in particular, there's a 0% chance if you're reading this it's you. I haven't seen or spoken to these acquaintances-at-best in many years.  
  
On a related note - I think the notion of a "self-help book" is paradoxical. If you're reading a self-help book, you're getting help from someone else. If you're reading a book because you thought "you know, I enjoy reading books. Reading makes me happy and I'm going to do that." - THEN you're self-helping. You should know yourself best, and what makes people happy is unique to them... or it should be for anything that's not as obvious as "eat right, sleep well, keep everything in balance."  
  
I dunno. Who the hell am I to say any of these things. Like I know better than other people. I'm just a guy who hasn't struggled much addressing these sorts of things in the past. I have been given the space and the time to define who I am and what makes me happy. I've had great mentors to show me the way... and I got lucky with the person I fell in love with in that she helps me to become the best version of me that I want to be. I like to think I somehow earned all that, but really it was just luck combined with a very self-centered approach to everything.  
  
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!  
  
Seriously. Here's a picture of a bottle of mouthwash so you can forget what I was just talking about and go on reading the rest.  
  
[![](assets/351-1.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPu-smS-gGE/W49E9J7yyFI/AAAAAAADR2I/dpRdKicmjRQexyeQTx3ITJeXNzmIqLvSACLcBGAs/s1600/Kids-Mouthwash.jpg)

  
My Nexus 6p is getting a bit [long in the tooth](https://www.google.com/search?q=long+in+the+tooth&oq=long+in+teh+tooth&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.3472j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Its battery isn't lasting like it once was. The lag is real. Ever since I saw the bezel-less iPhone X, I've had a hard time not noticing how gigantic the chin and forehead of my phone. It's three years old at this point - so I've been looking at the rumor mill... and it's not an easy pick.  
  
Let's look at the options:  
  
The iPhone XS (or XS Plus), hasn't technically been announced yet - but based off the leaks this thing looks pretty sleek. This will be king of the crop for another year, but will be priced as such.  
  
The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL also haven't been announced yet, but they've been leaked more than any smartphone in memory. I'll be shocked if there's anything we learn about it next month. The Pixel 3 XL has a stupidly large notch, and still has a chin bezel. I'm sure the rest of the phone will be fine, but man it seems like the worst design-by-committee I've seen from anything Google's made. The smaller Pixel 3 is a possibility, it has bezels on both sides and has a smaller, lower-res screen than my current phone. Despite those facts, it's the biggest contender against me going iPhone.  
  
The iPhone X is going to be a year old and will still _(probably)_ cost an arm and a leg... however this could be the direction we go if they're cheap.  
  
The Pixel 2 (or Pixel 2 XL) is going to be a year old immediately and has a questionable screen with large bezels. The future is bezeless. These are not.  
  
Time will tell.  
  
  
Top 5: Pros of Switching to the iPhone  
5\. From what I've seen, the iPhone offers a smoother experience than any Android phone. Applications themselves are better on average, and the OS itself seems to flow smoother.  
4\. There doesn't seem to be an Android phone that's worth upgrading to. The iPhone is an incredible piece of hardware that has no worthy Android rival from what I can see.  
3\. There are things I don't know about the switch that I'm sure to love.  
2\. Switching to a lightning charger means Melissa and I could swap phones on a single charger.  
1\. Apple's Health app is much closer aligned with the type of tracking than I like doing than Google's Fit app. Google Fit has always been a halfhearted endeavor at bestbb.   
  
Top 5: Cons of Switching to the iPhone  
5\. I don't plan to switch over to Apple services. So I'd have an iPhone and use Google Drive, Google Keep, the Google Assistant, and the Chrome browser.  
4\. I've spent some money on various applications that I'd no longer be using. There are some applications I'd have to re-buy.  
3\. There are things I don't know about the switch that I'm sure to hate.  
2\. Switching to a lightning charger means my phone would no longer use the same charger as my laptop, GoPro, & Nintendo Switch  
1\. The Life Tracker to Google Fit integration would break. I'd have to manually enter sleep, food, and exercise data into the life tracker until I figured out how to get something working through iOS (which would probably require me to develop and install my own apple app).

Motto: **I'm going to call Ratcatcher to trash this Copper**

  
This is likely the last post I will write before Melissa and I go on our vacation to celebrate our 1-year anniversary. I'd say you can expect the next one in a little over a week, and you can expect it to have pictures and maybe some stories.  
  
Everyone has always told me: "Oh, man, college is the best time of your life. You'd better live it up because you'll never get the chance to experience anything like that ever again." In a way, that's true. I'll never experience college again... but there are tons of things I'll never get to experience again. Their actual <message> isn't so much "carpe diem" as it is "middle school is terrible, high school sucks, college is awesome, and everything after that sucks".  
  
I'll tell you what:  
Not in my experience.  
  
Middle school <was> kind of rough... but only really due to internal factors. Everything you thought you knew about yourself changed and there's a stressful deeply-seeded desire to figure out who this new person is.  
  
High school was fine. A little more freedom, a little more responsibility.  
  
College was great - but not like "best thing that could ever be possible" great. College was extremely liberating and fun... but not without equal-yet-opposite costs. My experience in college involved a massive lack of time and money and massive loads of stress and responsibility.  
  
After college - THAT has been great. It's when you have all the freedom you had in college, but you ALSO have money and no homework! How could ANYONE not think this is awesome? I get to do what I want to do SO much MORE often now. My place is like what I want it to be like. I can cook my own food on my own stove. I can use the bathroom without having to put shoes on and walk down the hall.   
  
I've heard the same thing said about being single vs being married: "being single is so much more fun".  
  
Not in my experience.   
  
Being single was fine. You are who you are and that's that. Being married doesn't mean that has to stop. One of my favorite cliches: "getting married isn't about two halves coming together to make a whole, it's about two wholes coming together to be more than that." Maybe I'm atypical. I never much enjoyed "the thrill of the chase". Maybe that's for people who like roller coasters.  
  
I graduated almost exactly three years ago... and I can honestly say that the past 3 years have been, in order, my favorite 3 years of life so far.   
  
I think I'm going to leave it at that.  
  
Here's a totally unrelated photo:

Dominion: Adventures is fun.

  
Top 5: Things **I Could have also Talked About**  
5\. For the first time in forever, I feel like my workouts are producing tangible change in my physique.  
4\. Age of Ultron comes out in 3 (really, 2) days.  
3\. Bike riding is a lot of fun and should be a much larger part of our culture. I wish our infrastructure was designed to be more accommodating of manual transportation. aaaand it's a great way to stay in shape.  
2\. My thoughts on the future direction of the Column and/or the Life Tracker.  
1\. My recent edumacation learnings about GitHub and successfully contributing to an open-source project for the first time.

Motto: THIS IS SPARTA  
  
I've written 300 of these. That's a round number which seems significant. It's not, though. If humans had 12 fingers instead of 10, I'd likely be telling you this is post number "12C".  
  
That's a hexidecimal joke. Base 16, y'all.  
  
It's glorious outside right now. I'm probably going to go on a bike ride soon to take advantage of this wonderful fall weather.  
  
Pokemon Go is dying. I feel like conscious choices made by the developers of the application are to blame for their drop in player numbers. I still play, but likely will quit once show starts falling unless Niantic changes their minds about things.  
  
Today it occurred to me that, while I've taken a TON of data on myself by way of the Life Tracker, I had never really done any correlations between anything other than day of week, month of year, and against a simple list of day tags. Never before had I stopped to think "how does my sleep correlate to my eating?" See the Top 5(s) for some results.  
  
Having a home gym is awesome. I set a squat PR earlier today... in my underwear. It was great.  
  
October marks the start of my annual quest to "eat as much as possible and gain more weight". So far, I've done terribly. Food is not something I resort to out of boredom. Even if it were, I haven't been bored much in October. I haven't been bored much in the past year or two, really. Being married, owning a house, being employed, and having friends all come together to make life pretty darn good.  
  
No complaints.  
  
I'm going to end this Column now. I am deleting a large rant about Pokemon Go and replacing it with a much shorter paragraph (which you've already read - I write these posts in a non-linear fashion) about general disappointment with the game.  
  
Picture to go out on - we like each other.

Top 5: Correlated Data Points in the Life Tracker that Make Sense  
5\. My data is less complete the longer I wait to enter it (entry delay vs completeness: CC = -0.576)  
4\. I spend more money when I eat more overall (expense vs total caloric intake: CC = 0.118)  
3\. I feel better physically when I workout more (exercise frequency vs how I feel physically: CC = 0.298)  
2\. I eat less overall if I eat a higher amount of protein (total caloric intake vs percent protein: CC = -0.206)  
1\. I feel better mentally when I feel better physically (how I feel mentally vs how I feel physically: CC = 0.330)  
  
Top 5: Correlated Data Points in the Life Tracker that make No Sense  
  
5\. I sleep less when I eat more (sleep duration vs total caloric intake: CC = -0.208  
4\. The more I workout the more money I spend (exercise frequency vs expense: CC = 0.196)  
3\. I feel worse mentally when I workout more (exercise frequency vs how I feel mentally: CC = -0.150)  
2\. I feel worse mentally when I eat more fats (how I feel mentally vs percent fat: CC = -0.136  
1\. In general - the almost complete lack of correlation between sleep duration and anything else (other than food).

Motto: Darn the Bad Luck There

  
I got sick. It ruined everything. I haven't worked out since Friday. I had less than HALF my goal calories yesterday. I also missed my Wednesday post time. I didn't get to splice together the video I wanted to make for this Column. I'm angry about it.

  
I will not start another sentence in this post with the word "I".

  
Let's talk for a second about photo backup and storage -

  
First off, if you are storing your photos on your phone and nowhere else that's bad. Don't do that. Either pull them off your phone manually every couple of weeks or, better yet, install an app that backs them up for you.

  
There are several services on Android and iOS that do that. Dropbox, iCloud, Google+, Flickr, and others all offer private, automatic photo upload of some sort. They all work, but I'm going to tell you about the two with which I have experience.  

  
Dropbox is a great service. It is essentially just a folder on your computer that you can also access from any device with an internet connection. Dropbox is particularly good for automatic backup because it will _not only_ back up your photos to the cloud, _but also_ pull them from the cloud onto your home computer. This is just the most effortless way to get photos from your phone to your computer. Take pictures throughout the day and they'll already be on your computer by the time you're home.   
  
The only real drawback with Dropbox is storage space. You only get so much storage for free and each photo eats into that allotted space.   

  
The second option, and the option I'm currently using, is Google+. The Google+ automatic upload _does not_ give you Dropbox's benefit of automatically downloading the new pictures to your computer, but it _does_ offer some benefits over Dropbox. First, there's infinite storage for your pictures at "standard size" (which is \~2 Megapixels). The second and more important thing is the photos you take are automatically enhanced and indexed. They will even create new photos for you. Let me show you what I mean...

  
**Automatic Indexing:**

Google uses their Google Goggles image recognition tech to automatically tag your photos with things that might be in your pictures. Never once have I went through my pictures and said "this picture contains a cat" in any way, shape, or form, but if you search for "cat" in my backed up photo album...

Viola! Pictures of cats.  
  
**Automatic enhancement:**  
Google+ provides an online photo editing platform that is surprisingly robust. Every photo they store is automatically (and subtly) enhanced, like such...

The edit isn't earth shattering. Both pictures kind of suck, but now one sucks a little less hard. Note that reverting the Auto Enhanced picture back to its original state is always one button click away.  
  
**Auto Awesome:**  
Without a doubt, the coolest thing Google has implemented is the "Auto Awesome" feature. Google will take the photos you've uploaded and create entirely _new_ photos from your shots. It can do things like create a group photo where everyone is actually smiling out of several group photos where there's always at least one person yawning (or whatever). It can stitch together several shots of scenery into one panoramic photo. It will create a moving GIF (note "Gif" not "Jif") of similar pictures, like so...

Google made that GIF for me out of the ten GoPro burst photos I posted a few minutes ago. I made that Google+ post specifically to see if I could get Google to make this GIF.  
  
To wrap everything up:  
  
Illness ruins perfect projects (but I'm going to keep going)  
  
Don't be a fool, find a backup tool.  
  
Google is awesome.  
  
**Update on the October Project so far -**  
  
Avg. Calories: 3580 (down 12% from last time)  
Avg. Protein: 178 (down 16%)  
Missed Workouts: 3 (up ∞%)  

Top 5: Reservations I'm Starting to Have about the October Project

5\. My increased protein intake has come along with similarly increased fats and carbs  
4\. I'm eating ice cream in the name of calorie surplus... that can't be good  
3\. No caffeine? Seriously? How are you supposed to stay awake?  
2\. Working out every day is for over achievers  
1\. Once you get used to eating 4000 calories a day, is it hard to stop?

Motto: \#ItsAllConnected

  
If you don't care about Marvel Comics, this post might not be for you. If you intend to, but haven't yet seen everything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), this might not be a smart read. This Column will contain no spoilers for the "Marvel's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.". No worries there. The last time I wrote about the MCU, I said that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was floundering, but I was sticking with it. I was impressed with Thor 2 and was looking forward to Captain America 2\. Since that time, several things have happened: 1\. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. started to get a little better 2\. Captain America: The Winter Soldier came out, was awesome 3\. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was force to turn on its head to deal with the fallout of Cap 2, everything changed for the better and changed for good. 4\. Captain America 3 was officially announced. 5\. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season One came to a close, had huge impacts on the rest of MCU. Here's the official timeline of MCU entries (2008-2016):   
  
  
[![](assets/173-1.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1qDA6LYXgb8/U5Dqt2inl2I/AAAAAAABXIg/UM%5FpQirNHow/s1600/%23173+-+MCU+Spreadsheet.PNG)

So, that's where we stand. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was awesome. I'm saddened by the fact that I've only seen it once. It is in my top 3 favorite entries into the MCU thus far. It was a great story, with perfectly done action sequences, and with (thanks to the disestablishment of S.H.I.E.L.D.) a huge impact on all subsequent entries into the MCU. No place else was that impact more heavily felt and readily apparent than the TV show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.". Despite it's name, the show wasn't blindsided or hurt by the events of Captain America. In fact, much the opposite is true. They knew it was coming all along. The haphazard start to the show had was a necessary evil to setup the awesomeness of the second half of the season. Everything changes. It retroactively makes the first half of the season much better. It even kinda/sorta/maybe sets up the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy. I will drop back in with my thoughts on that movie (and my 26th birthday, and my 2nd Second-A-Day video) in early August.

  
Top 5: Current/Future Superhero Universes in Cinema

5\. Fox is planning to reboot the Fantastic Four in 2015\. Who knows if they will try to shoehorn in some sort of "extended universe" play. I'm going to guess they will do whatever they can to make money.  
4\. Sony's currently active "Amazing Spiderman" series starring whatshisface from The Social Network. Andrew Garfield. They have some longevity built in, with storylines plotted all the way out to 2018\. They want to build out parts of the Spiderman Universe that don't directly involve Peter Parker (such as a movie dedicated to Venom or the Sinister Six). That's a good thing because Andrew Garfield has already expressed some desire to leave the character behind. I didn't bother watching "The Amazing Spiderman 2" in theaters (which is saying something, cause I watched everything else out at that time).  
3\. DC and Warner Bros are desperately trying to make the Justice League the "Pepsi" to the "Coke" Marvel provides with the Avengers. This technically started with Henry Cavill in "Man of Steel", but will _really_ start with the currently filming "Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice". I've read they will be exploring a single story arc that takes place across 6 movies. Frankly, I don't think the Justice League plays out nearly as well as Marvel's Avengers. Too many capes, maybe.  
2\. Fox's X-Men series. Really, this might deserve to take the top spot on this list. 2000's "X-Men" is the superhero movie that is widely pointed at as starting the superhero craze that we've been in for the past 14 years. They've managed to keep the same cast and keep the same storyline for 14 years. Even with the noteworthy low-points, that an impressive accomplishment. They have between 2 and 4 more movies planned in the X-Men universe. "Days of Future Past" kind of hits the reset button on their story arc, though. So, we'll see how they go about rebuilding things.  
1\. Marvel and Disney's "The Avengers" series, a.k.a. the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They started it all off with Iron Man in 2008\. The plan was to build out franchises of superheroes that were aware of and could meet one another... all culminating in "The Avengers". That was immensely successful, so they began thinking more long-term. They have movies planned out "as far as 2028". If they keep putting movies out at their current pace, that means they've got about 18-19 more movies planned out. Frankly, I'm nervous they will start to sour after "The Avengers 3". How do you keep going after something that huge?

Motto: I Hate Getting My Hair Cut.

  
Yesterday was the worst day I've had since Thor died. Let me tell you the story. Let me tell you the story of my haircut. I hate getting my hair cut. I always have. This is for several reasons:  
* I have to slouch really low in the chair and it hurts my back.
* I have to small talk for 15 minutes with someone whose usual barrage of smalltalk questions never apply to me (sports this and cars that, seriously).
* I never know what to tell the barber.
* I have to hear a sales pitch for how I should do my hair differently, usually involving expensive hair goo that they would be glad to sell me.
* And, to top it all off, I have to pay for all of my troubles.
Usually I bring along a partner to dull some of the displeasures. Melissa can tell them what I want and can talk to them while I sit there in slightly less uncomfortable silence. Yesterday I tried to get a preliminary haircut to set the stage for a real, professional one that I'd get one week before the wedding. That's when this happened: 

[![](assets/163-1.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ePx9CpSc7hw/U0GWiA-z4OI/AAAAAAABLTE/AQFDg225ZCE/s1600/2014-04-06)

How did this happen? I was out running errands by myself. I had laundry in the wash and wanted to get back in time to move it over to the drier. I had 20ish minutes, which seemed like a good amount of time for a quick hair cut. When I got to Sports Clips (the only place that's open on a Sunday) I slouched way down in the chair and told the lady what I wanted. I think she could sense that I was in a bit of a hurry. I based what I wanted was off my previous haircut, which I actually very much liked. I made a point to ask my previous barber what she did so I could tell all future barbers to do the same. I confirmed my recollection of what she said with Melissa before I started my errands. After I told the barber what I wanted, she said "oh, so you want to go a lot shorter?". I've heard that before, you know. I don't like haircuts, so I always go somewhat short and let it grow way out so as to maximize the time between cuts. Barbers usually tell me it's going to be a lot shorter. It's always a lot shorter. That's what a haircut is. So I just said "yup". She said alright and started her work with the buzzer thing. She started on the back and sides of my head. I was turned 45 degrees from the mirror - it was in front of me and to my left. When she started in on the top of my head, she started just behind my right ear. In other words, completely on the backside of my head from what I could see in the mirror. She was working fast - really fast. After her second pass over my right ear I knew something felt wrong. I turned my head to see what was going on. That's when my heart sank right down through my stomach, into the chair, then into the floor. She was shaving my head. Shorter than a crew cut. Shorter even than what I'd typically think of when I think of a buzz cut. She'd already taken off 1/3rd of the hair from the top of my head. I could see my scalp... clearly. I gasped, and apparently looked pretty upset. She asked what was wrong. I asked her if what she was using was what I told her to use. She said yes, and it turned out she was right. What I had told her was way wrong. Either way, it was too late to turn back, so we finished the job. My hair is the shortest it's ever been. At least it's the shortest it's been since I was a little bald baby. I look like a recovering cancer patient... and I am getting MARRIED in LESS than a MONTH. How did this happen? Afterwards, I moved the laundry from the wash to the drier and called Melissa. I started the conversation off with "I'm so sorry". Conversations that start with an apology are never good. When I asked the barber on my previous haircut what I should say to people to have them to cut it like that from now on. I could have swore she said "have them do a 2 on the sides, 3 on top". At the time, that sounded like a perfectly reasonable description of my hair. It was shortish on the sides, a little longer on top. I asked Melissa before I started my errands if 2 & 3 sounded right. She said "sure". I don't know what my previous barber had said, but it couldn't have been 2 & 3\. Turns out that "2" and "3" refer to "1/4 inch" and "3/8 inch". If I knew that, I'd have known it was obviously not what I was looking for. I might look okay by the time of the wedding - but I will NOT look like Aaron Gillespie. On the day when you meet the extended friends and family of your bride, the day when you are supposed to represent the best possible version of yourself, I won't look like me. On the day that arguably the most important pictures of your life are taken, I won't look like me. On the day that inarguably the greatest number of pictures of you are taken, I won't look like me. It's the worst possible thing that could have happened at that barber shop. I was just getting a preliminary cut. There was going to be a professional cut done about a week out from the wedding. It didn't matter what my hair looked like, so long as it was fixable in a few weeks. It was supposed to be quick and insignificant, and it turned into the most important and worst haircut I've ever gotten. How did this happen? How many things had to go wrong exactly like they did for this to have gotten so badly messed up? I feel like a teenager who took the car out for a joyride in a mostly empty parking lot... who then hit the only vehicle parked in it. If ANYTHING other than what happened happened, we'd be fine. How did this happen? I had to break the news to Melissa. That was hard. She's still sad about it, but she knows how terrible I feel. She's put so much work into planning this wedding and I went and irrevocably screwed the pooch in 3 minutes. Thousands of dollars on photography, ruined (or, at the very least, sullied) by a $20 haircut. Now, for the next month, every single person who knows me will look at me and, in an instant, say "WHAT HAPPENED?! Aren't you getting married in a month? Is Melissa pissed? How did that happen!? Why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you make sure it wasn't going to look like that." Then they'll call me an idiot. And I'll deserve it. How did this happen? So: To Melissa: I'm sorry. To everyone else reading this: Please don't ask.

  
Top 5: Candy and Nuts that could have Prevented This

20\. If I hadn't been in a hurry - but I was. 19\. If I had shown her a picture of what I was looking for - but I didn't. 18\. If I had said "around an inch on the top" - but I didn't. 17\. If I had mentioned anything about "bangs", or "off the ears", or anything else to tip her off that I was picturing something way different from what I told her to do - but I didn't. 16\. If I had said "I've got a wedding in a month, I want to set it up for another haircut in a few weeks" - but I didn't. 15\. If I had waited to get it cut in a few weeks, when it would have been my last cut before the wedding - but I didn't. 14\. If I had gotten this cut a month ago so it could grow out some more - but I didn't. 13\. If I had looked up what "3" was on the internet, or asked somebody, just to be sure - but I didn't. 12\. If my recollection of what my previous barber had said was off in the OTHER direction - but it wasn't. 11\. If I had insisted on facing directly towards the mirror so I could keep a better eye on what she was doing - but I didn't. 10\. If she had faced me directly towards the mirror in the first place - but she didn't. 9\. If she had phrased the "you want to go a lot shorter" differently... "you want a buzzcut", "you want to take it all off", "you don't want to have to comb it anymore", or said anything other than specifically what she said - but she didn't. 8\. If she'd confirmed with me in any other fashion before making the first cuts - but she didn't. 7\. If she hadn't been going so fast - but she was. 6\. If she had stopped and asked me how it was looking at any point before she made the irreversible cuts to the top of my head - but she didn't. 5\. If she had started on the side of my head that wasn't on the complete opposite side of the mirror - but she didn't. 4\. If Melissa had said "I'm not sure 2 & 3 are right" - but she didn't. 3\. If Melissa, or anybody else had been there - but nobody was. 2\. If it hadn't been a new hair place - but it was. 1\. If the barber shop WE WENT TO THE DAY BEFORE wasn't CLOSED AT 2PM - but it was.  
  
If ANY ONE of those 20 things HADN'T been the case, I'm sure that this wouldn't have happened. But they all happened... and now I look like an evil henchman from an action movie.

Motto: Have a holly, jolly Christmas, a happy, slappy Hanukkah, a hippy, trippy Kwanzaa, and/or a pleasant end of the year, non-religious vacation.

  
Way back when I was _first_ starting the October project (a.k.a. "The Hugening") I wrote to you about a Google Engineer by the name of Matt Cutts who has been doing self-imposed 30 day challenges for the past few years. In October, I tried my hand at a 30(ish) day challenge, and found out I really enjoyed it! Melissa and I have resolved to do 12 challenges in 2014\. One challenge per month, to be decided upon on the 1st of the month and reviewed at the end of the month.  
  
We are starting January off with a challenging challenge: the Paleo Diet.  
  
The Too Long; Didn't Read of the Paleo Diet is that humans now are essentially the same creatures as we were in the Paleolithic era. The "food" we eat today is not at all what our bodies are expecting - and it causes significant health problems. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and many more noninfectious diseases can be avoided through proper diet... of which Paleo is one of the most stringent.  
  
So, for the next 30(ish) days: Melissa and I will slowly forget what "sweet" tastes like.  

  
The holidays have come and gone. I spent a lot of time with everyone I care about most and I couldn't be more grateful for it all. 

  
I'd like to talk for a moment about Dominion.  
  
Dominion is the non-collectable, collectable card game. It's a nerdy game, but I don't mind the stigma. It's fun. It's easy to pick up on, as complex or simple as you want to make it, and infinitely replayable. I've been playing it a few times a week since I was introduced to it by my great friend Danielle a couple of months back. I bought the original "Dominion" base game the same day she showed me how to play it. Within two months, my dominion of Dominion cards looked like this:  
  
[![](assets/132-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n0R7q5qV%5Fyc/UsUCq9fkV-I/AAAAAAABGD4/7xG2VFjYg-4/s1600/IMG%5F20131225%5F122109%5B1%5D.jpg)

  
There are 8 expansions to the original Dominion game. I now have 5 of them. You can see (some of) the boxes stacked up on the counter in the background of the photo above. The box that Dominion comes in is huge and mostly full of air. Add on another 5 expansions, and the possibility of portability becomes prohibitively preposterous.

  
So I decided to fix the problem.

  
[![](assets/132-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HbXYyhiwUaE/UsT%5FwJ2aMpI/AAAAAAABGDs/wpzn0UVFSEc/s1600/IMG%5F20131230%5F171624.jpg)

  
I made that box. This is what it looks like on the inside.

  
[![](assets/132-3.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RozW2h69r78/Ur%5FDQmlBvWI/AAAAAAABFrk/TZq-BagfnWM/s1600/Dominion+Box+-+1)

  
I'm not going to bore you with the organizational details, but I will say it's suits my needs perfectly. The empty row is intentional, and will be used some day, when I get around to picking up the last three expansions to the game (if, for no other reason, a sense of completeness). 

  
I have many cameras.

  
GoPro, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, Canon Vixia, and those are just _mine_. I also have access to another few if you include Melissa's cameras. One of these days I want to do some sort of a project that involves 7 or 8 camera angles. That would be sweet.

  
Top 5: Goals for the Break

5\. Think of 12 Solid Life Changes for the Plan (7/12)  
4\. Update the Second-a-Day Video (0/1)  
3\. Make a Box to Store Dominion In (DONE)  
2\. Read a Book (0/1)  
1\. Finish this Post (DONE IN THE NICK OF TIME)

Motto: IRON FIIIST  
  
I changed the layout to the Column. This is how it looks now. I guess that's all there is to say about that.  
  
In 18 days the Life Tracker will turn 4 years old. My earliest data are dated 04/22/2013\. That doesn't mean I'll have 4x365+1forleapyears = 1461 day's worth of data, unfortunately. It used to be that if I missed a single day, I had to nuke the entire week's data. That happened something like 35 times during those 4 years, so my extensive journal only has just shy of 1200 days in it. Regardless - it's pretty INSERTWORDHERE\* that I'm still doing this after so long.  
  
\*INSERTWORDHERE - pick any of the following: cool, sad, impressive, boring.  
  
I imagine I'll write more about the Life Tracker after it's 4-year-iversary, but now it's time to talk about Marvel stuff.  
  
Iron Fist was pretty bad. I didn't want to write this because I just talked about MCU lows a few Columns ago, but because I'm such a fan/Marvel apologist I feel obligated to share my review...   
  
It kinda sucked.  
  
1\. The main character is a moron. At first it's a bit endearing & you understand it. He was basically abandoned as a kid and grew up on his own far away in a land where life is very very different... but you'd think they'd teach him basic logic, self-restraint, and discipline. It becomes clear after episode 5 or 6 that he's not changing. He's just going to act like a dumb kid for the entire series (spoilers: he does).  
  
2\. Much of the dialog didn't feel like stuff people would actually say in real life.  
  
3\. The action scenes were not all that great. They would have been good maybe 5 to 10 years ago, but there's been a resurgence of fight scenes where you can actually tell what's happening lately (see: John Wick, or even Marvel/Netflix's own Daredevil). This really fell short. Not saying it was all bad - it just failed to deliver a showcase of who was supposed to be one of THE best fighters in all of Marvel lore.  
  
4\. The show sets up a very interesting backstory. It sets you up to think they'll pay it off... then it ends with two red lights. If you watch it you'll know what I mean.  
  
5\. The trailer for the show committed TWO of my Top 5 Deadly Sins for movie trailers... it showed the best effect in the whole show & the action scene at the finale of the series, which set you up to believe the whole thing will be like that.  
  
6\. Integration with the MCU as a whole felt simultaneously forced and sparing. The references that get made & characters that show up feel like they don't belong... while OTHER characters who seem like they would make more sense never show up to begin with. Luke Cage was bad with this, too.  
  
7\. The setup for next season came out of left field - and not in the good way. Suddenly someone does something that's completely out of character with who they were all season, and the reason the story gave them was so weak I already forgot what it was. The ending was almost as bad as Agent Carter, season 2 - whose cliffhanger will never be resolved.  
  
All that said, I still have high hopes for The Defenders, where Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Iron Fist come together to fight Sigourney Weaver.  
  
Reddit did a really cool thing, and in doing so restored a little of my faith in the people of the site, the people of the internet, and to some extent people in general.   
  
On April Fool's Day a few days back, http://www.reddit.com/r/place became a thing. /r/place started off as a blank, white, 1000 pixel by 1000 pixel canvas. Anyone whose Reddit account existed on 3/31/2017 was allowed to change the color of ONE of those 1 million pixels one time every five minutes to any of 16 possible colors. Pixels previously written could be overwritten with a new color. Trying to make anything happen 1 pixel at a time is maddening. Made worse by the fact that the pixels you made red would be turned green by some other Redditor you don't know in some far away land.   
  
The whole thing was an experiment. Just to see what would happen. Would it be pure chaos? Or would some order come to exist? Well, as you've probably already seen - it wound up being a bit of both:  
  
[![](assets/310-1.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AV%5FIbZhhecI/WORMRTUwBTI/AAAAAAACo0E/8xYyXGXKhoEpZ9jGyKfgMAqMhyic6bnbACLcB/s1600/place.png)

  
That image looks like craziness... but if you start looking at the hundreds individual details, they tell hundreds of little stories. Battles between ideas. Compromises. It's a lot easier to appreciate what this became if you had a hand in making it. I contributed about a dozen red pixels. The majority of which were overwritten by other people, trying to destroy that which the group I came from had created. So seeing the sorts of things people were able to do with this simply amazes me.  
  
People are pretty incredible.  
  
If you've got some time, you should watch a least a minute of this video:  
  
  
Top 5: Deadly Trailer Sins

4\. Showing basically ANYTHING from the 3rd act - I like trailers that are restricted almost wholly to the movie's 1st act  
3\. **BWHAAAAAMMM**  
2\. Revealing some piece of information the movie treats like a twist   
1\. Trailers that make you feel like you just saw the whole movie

Motto: Diagnostics, on a Personal Level

  
Because I anticipate this is a boring subject for many/most of you - I've included a **TL;DR** just above the Top 5 to which you can skip.  
  
In [Column #242](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2015/05/242-feature-life-tracker.html) I wrote about the Life Tracker pretty extensively. While Melissa was out of town last week at Starvy Creek Bluegrass Festival I did something [I wasn't able to do](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2015/06/247-im-annoying.html) when she went to Los Angeles: Utilize my time productively.  
  
The Life Tracker has been revision bumped from 2.0 to 3.0\. It was a complete, bottom-up rewrite of what I spent weeks coding a couple years back; and I accomplished it in less than two days. In Column #242 I outlined some goals. Here's a report card for how I did:  
  
**Goal: Less Reliance on Google**  
The Life Tracker 3.0 is still hosted on Google Scripts & Google Spreadsheets. It utilizes a Google Form for input. Given all these facts, though, I was still surprisingly successful. My old code read like "take this thing from this exact spot on the form and and put it on this exact spot on the spreadsheet". My new code is broken down into many functional blocks - only the first and last of which have _anything_ to do with Google Forms or Google Spreadsheets. Everything in between is self-contained. I could easily port the middle (vast majority of the program) to another platform.  
  
**Goal: Automatic Data Entry**  
This has been a massive success. I used to pull up 5 apps to do my data input. Now I'm using two apps. Soon I'll be down to one. My scripts automatically pull my heart rate, weight, pedometer, estimated caloric burn, and any exercise information from their respective apps on my phone. From a different source, I am automatically pulling in the weather. My code will soon be capable of pulling Nutrition information as well.   
  
Cool side note: I found a bug in Google's APIs, brought it to their attention, and was told "yup that's a bug, we'll fix it". **Aaron Gillespie had an admittedly small but measurable affect on Google's code.** \#Legit \#TooCool \#Hashtag  
  
**Goal: Not Just Me**  
This one I've been less successful with. As of right now, the code is flexible enough to handle the addition or subtraction of tracking points with little hassle, but it certainly needs to be touched if someone else were to want to use my system. It's much better than it _was_, certainly.   
  
I have given this one a ton of thought and have some ideas that I'll work on next time Melissa is out of town. Also, to really develop a generalized "Life Tracker" system, I'd need to find a volunteer assistant who'd be willing to work with me to define their goals, wants, and give me feedback on bugs & whatnot.  
  
**Goal: Support for Incomplete Datasets**  
This was another _massive_ success. So much so, that I've retroactively went in and added (mostly blank) rows for every week that I missed in the past two years. My code handles missing data without fail (yet), and the analytics takes into account holes in the data. Each day now has an (automatically calculated) level of "Completeness" that I can use to see how diligent I've been in my tracking. Over the 4th of July I didn't track food, but I still have most of my health data, journal entries, and other data points. Overall, it's 90% there. It used to be that missing that one thing would have killed not only that day, but that entire week. I'm very glad to have fixed this issue.  
  
**Goal: Refined Tracking Points**  
This is complete. I'll cover more on this in the Top 5.  
  
Refactoring the Life Tracker is this month's 30 Day Challenge. This is a transition line.  
  
So. What's it like to actually _USE_?  
  
I use several apps for their respective purpose:  
* [LifeSum](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sillens.shapeupclub) for food
* [Google Fit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness) for exercise & heart rate
* [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) for Sleep
* [Withings Health Mate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2) \+ smart scale for weight & heart rate
  
Each night I fill out this form:  
  
  
[![](assets/250-1.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QzJsVdivKKg/VaK5K3c6pdI/AAAAAAAB334/XXdEOD2cN5g/s1600/%2523250%2B-%2Bform%2Bbegin.png)

  
[This whole paragraph is a link to a duplicate of the form I fill out. It's not the live form, so you can go nuts checking it out or filling it out with whatever data you want. No skin off my back.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lbdYQCTdlx9wJtLWyR-aErBPRFt-MKvZ3iQNrr1jGCA/viewform)  
  
At the end of the day, I get a new row in a spreadsheet that looks like this (but all one one line):  
  
  
[![](assets/250-2.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XrxuDvreG0Q/VaK4Y4nI7nI/AAAAAAAB33w/324liHbpugM/s1600/%2523250%2B-%2BTracker%2BRow.png)

  
That's it.  
  
For the picture(s) to go out on, I'll leave you with some charts that were not possible on pre-3.0 versions:

None of the new metrics have been around long enough to show meaningful correlations, but I expect there will be some.  
  
**TL;DR** \- The Life Tracker 3.0 is a (mostly complete) total rewrite of my project. It's successful on multiple levels. It already accomplishes most of what I set out to do, and will continue to improve with time.

  
Top 5: **Additions to My Tracking Points**  
5\. **Money!** I successfully built money into the Life Tracker for the first time. It's not kept up-to-date on a daily basis, but I've made it as easy as 3.14159265358979323846264338 to import from Mint. This data won't be so useful on a day-to-day basis (I anticipate an inaccuracy of \~72 hours invoked by standard commercial behavior), but it's still valid on a month-by-month basis.  
4\. **Weather!** The weather happens every day, regardless of my behavior... but perhaps the weather influences my behavior. The weather is automatically imported for each day, based on the location information I input when I fill out the form each night.  
3\. **Tags!** A tag-based system for daily-effecting events and for exercise. Day Tags are such things like "napped" or "day off work" wherein I can specify certain attributes or events a day might have. Exercise tags enable me to specify what I accomplished on a more granular level than before. I used to have a list of 5 different genres of exercise. Now I can say I tag "circuit, lower, cardio, and twoaday" to denote doing a circuit-based workout for my legs and, separately, some form of cardiovascular exercise.   
2\. **Completeness!** A "completeness" metadatum is now included. This automatically added figure is a measure of how "sloppy" I've been with recording things. This feature is actually much larger value-add than I anticipated. It tells me that I tracked 45% of 2013, 61% of 2015, and 59% of 2015 so far. I expect those completeness figures to go up now that missing a single day's worth of any one point doesn't kill all points for the entire week.  
1\. I'm newly tracking **location, wake up times, exercise start & stop times, exercise duration, water intake, average heart rate, estimated caloric burn, lag time between data entry & data dates, Tracker version number, an optional daily "reference" (for things I know I'll need to remember later), and official spots for my 30 Day Challenges** and their results. These are cut & dried additions, but in aggregate they are huge. More importantly, I managed to add all of things while **reducing** the amount of work I have to put in on a day-to-day basis to keep track of it all.

Motto: GET READY FOR FINANCE, BABY

  
Taxes are needlessly confusing. At least that's how I always found them to be. Some relatively simple jargon like "deductible" kept me from understanding what's really a pretty basic concept. Here's what almost 30 year old Aaron wishes he could send back in time 10 years to almost 20 year old Aaron.

Motto: It's My Party and I'll Cry to [Make a Throwback Joke](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/08/22-its-my-party-and-ill-cry-to-get.html)

  
Yesterday was my 26th birthday. I'm 26 years old. I've lived long enough to see 5 presidents go through the White House... 3 of which I actually remember. Since I was born, all of the Sodium-22 in the world has seen radioactive decay on half its atoms 10 times over. I'm nearly 1 Saturn-year old. I'm almost to my 10,000th day on this planet (December 18th of next year there will be a party). When I'm twice as old as I am now, it will be the year 2040\. If all goes according to plan, I'll be making tons of money. I'll have kids. There's a good chance I'll even have grandkids. I met Melissa 4 years, 299 days ago. That has nothing to do with my age, but it's also true.

  
**"Life goes by so fast"** \- that's what they say.   
  
But who know who the "they" is in that situation? I think it's people who _let_ their lives "go by" that fast. Life shouldn't _go by_ you at all. You should actively engage in it every day. One of the key things I took away from my brief stent between University and full-blown jobdom was the following self-advice monolog I wrote:  
  
_First you have to know, not fear, **know** that someday you're gunna die. Every day wasted and every night squandered you don't get back. Seize the day. Seize the moment. Seize opportunities - in whatever form they might come. Say **“yes”** more. When you say “no” to life you're not living. Everything is gained through experience and experience is gained by doing. So go do things. Go meet people. **Do not tiptoe through life to arrive safely at death.** Actively and intentionally seek out adventure. Have new experiences. Make new memories. You'll miss out on a lot of good times if you try to avoid a few bad ones. Bad times and awkward moments are part of a full life. They are unavoidable. They are also temporary; and **they, too, shall pass.** And when they do they will leave behind them a wiser and better person. You have to be lost for a while before you can know where you are._   
  
So, please, don't reach my age and say "life goes by so fast"; because I'm not going to.   
  
That's my little motivational speech. For those of you who came here for some videos, that's what's up next. There are two videos attached to this Column. The second Second-a-Day Video is below the first one.

  
For the past two years, as all of you probably already know, I've been filming a second of my life every day. Last year at this time I completed the following - My 24th Year:
  
  
Just yesterday, I finished my second straight year. It was a crazy year. I got married. I moved. I switched jobs. Melissa and I got some pets. We lost one of those pets. We got a sequel. We went on a honeymoon. We planned everything. Melissa started and completed her first year as a school teacher. My sisters both had babies. I found out about the boardgame Dominion. I worked out. I rode a rollercoaster for some reason. Why am I telling you when I can just show you?  
  
Here's what I did last year:  
  
  
Coming eventually - a 18 minute supercut of both of those stitched together (or you could just watch them back to back really fast).  
  
Yes, I will be making "My 26th Year".  
  
The picture to go out on: My wife is an excellent gift-giver.

The notes say "to begin your collection :-)" and "...and to complete your collection". They _also_ say "nerd" and "I <3 nerds" off-screen. My wife is great. My _life_ is great.

Motto: "What running features should each Column have?"

  
Five months ago I wrote a feature post titled "Minimalist Thought Experiment". In that post I gave a definition of the phrase "thought experiment", ripped straight from Wikipedia. What I didn't say was how they are related to my life. I do thought experiments all the time. I love them. It's so fun to take something you know, throw all of your preconceived notions out the window and take a fresh look at it. You start with a very fundamental question. After the question is well defined, you start thinking of a broad outline of stuff. You take big strokes to cover all the facets of the problem. After you're fairly certain the 20,000 ft view looks about right, you start getting down to specifics. If it sounds like no fun, then you just haven't asked the right question. **Thought Experiments I've Done:** \*Note these first 3 or 4 are very similar in spirit. 

[![](assets/201-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FQ4-qy-Uiak/VA4uqN-jPUI/AAAAAAABcxQ/IMTzmzQloPU/s1600/IMG%5F20140212%5F191058.jpg)

**EDC**What minimal set of items would best equip me to handle the widest array of situations I might come across in every day life, and how could I equip them? I'm going to go into a bit of detail on this one to give you a feel for how I approach these things. The inciting question begets several new questions: What things do I absolutely have to have? What can I fit in my pockets? What _can't_ I fit in my pockets? Knowing I'll probably need some sort of bag, what should that be like? What things would I _like_ to have, given the space? Which of these things do I already own? How much money am I willing to spend to get the rest? At that point, I had a list of things to put in my hypothetical bag. I had an idea of what _type_ of bag I wanted, but no official pick. I knew I wanted something to hold a tablet and a waterbottle and I knew I didn't want it to sit on both my shoulders. I started Googling things, narrowing down my menu of options. Eventually I settled on a bag that I used and loved for over a year. The fact that it subsequently changed doesn't matter. I'm still much better off than I would have been had I never gone through that exercise to begin with.

**Trunk Monkey**What minimal set of items would best equip me to handle the widest array of situations I might come across on the road?" Now I have a toolbox in my trunk that's saved my bacon on more than two occasions. 

[![](assets/201-3.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rcS3puIMORw/VA4wo0qP9-I/AAAAAAABcxg/-XX1LTiGpXo/s1600/IMG%5F20140905%5F123818%3Anopm%3A.jpg)

**Camping Box/Action Packer**What minimal set of items would best equip me to handle X situation? Now I have a box full of stuff to go camping that's going to come in handy real soon. 

[![](assets/201-4.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P%5Fx0gY9RV-I/VA41kgHVx1I/AAAAAAABcxo/mpKmw-lNevk/s1600/%23201%2B-%2BMinimalist%2BHouse.PNG)

**Minimalist Living/The 100 Thing Challenge**If I were to live on my own, what is the smallest amount of space and minimal set of items I'd require to live a happy, semi-comfortable life? This thought experiment never jumped into real life in any way. If it did, that would mean that something had gone terribly wrong in my life... so I hope to never put this one into practice. Even still it was a useful exercise. After I started thinking about this problem I discovered a thing called the ["100 Thing Challenge"](http://www.amazon.com/The-100-Thing-Challenge-Everything/dp/0061787744#). Beyond the "minimal set of items"-type experiments, I've done several others.

**Technological Setup**What platforms, Operating Systems, and programs would work best for any given set of needs? This has translated over into the real world insofaras I've made one to fit MY given set of needs. 

[![](assets/201-6.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WI6mF8rJmgQ/VA46aqhYqpI/AAAAAAABcyw/F1S5KuuemO8/s1600/IMG%5F20140908%5F181637.jpg)

  
**Superpower**If you could have any superpower, what would it be? I've gone through several iterations of this. I don't want invulnerability because you'd eventually be the only living thing in the universe. I don't want flight because I think that flying would require an incredible amount of physical exertion (nobody ever asks that question, is flying more difficult than running?). I settled on super intelligence... kind of like the movie Limitless. Maybe even something as simple as "The ability to know the answer to every question I can come up with." Then I'd know the best answer to all of the questions I'm writing about in this post (as well as everyone's dirtiest secrets, the winning lottery numbers, the keys to eternal youth, how to bring about world peace, etc).   
This is the only photo I took specifically for this post. Melissa is supportive (minus the "you should put a shirt on" comment).

**Best way to die/the worst way to die**What would be the best/worst way to die? My friends and I came up with tons of examples of awesome ways to die. There was the ever-popular "quietly in my sleep at the age of 112", but that's boring. My favorite scenario was one I proposed: You just so happen to look like the President of the United States, which is awesome because he's your favorite President ever. He visits your hometown and you two just so happen to meet each other in a convenience store. You tell him you really respect him and what he's done with the country. He thanks you and shakes your hand. Completely overwhelmed with excitement, you exit the store. Your head is blown off by a sniper from 600 meters out who mistook you for the President. Because he thinks he shot the President, he flees the area without hitting the actual President. 1\. You don't see it coming. 2\. You die instantly. 3\. You just met your hero, fulfilling some sort of lifelong dream. 4\. You've saved your hero's life. 5\. You go out as a National Hero (sorta). That's how I want to go. Regarding the _worst_ way to die, we came up with tons. I'm not going to enumerate them, but they can all be summarized as "slowly and painfully". **Thought Experiments I've Partially Done** 

[![](assets/201-8.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rKp9ztS-kLY/VA5G2VKei%5FI/AAAAAAABczU/tiM4hwYu9Ao/s1600/IMG%5F1735.JPG)

**Perfectly Healthy**What would a day/week/month in a perfectly healthy lifestyle look like? This one I've done... sorta. I never officially finished it. 

[![](assets/201-9.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-%5FmXGiy8ePmQ/VA5JSbOkcCI/AAAAAAABczo/xPoUoP5UnUM/s1600/Screenshot%5F2014-09-08-19-25-54.png)

**Ideal Note taking system**What platform can I use to take and keep notes on everything that I need to keep track of in life? This question dogged me for years. I decided that I needed: Ubiquity - access on every platform Security - password protection and encryption on individual notes Speed & Search - take and find notes in under 1 minute Formatting - support for photos, videos, audio, hyperlinks, hyperlinks between notes, tagging, and basic text formatting Usage Limitations - none. Or at least no practicle ones. Bonus feature: Calendar integration I tried to make something work well over a dozen times throughout the past five years, Melissa can attest to how annoying it was. I spent a lot of time on the [Wikipedia Comparison of Notetaking Software page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Fnotetaking%5Fsoftware). I tried to build systems for years. I finally have settled on a sorta 4-pronged approach using Google Drive, Calendar, and Keep along with Keepass for my secure data. It's definitely not ideal, but the problem is there IS NO IDEAL NOTETAKING SOLUTION to fit my needs - and that fact makes ZERO sense. I'm frustrated to this day with this fact. This one is sort of a work in progress. 

[![](assets/201-10.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jlu1Vg0TM0U/VA5MjgEBCAI/AAAAAAABcz8/99IQG5wWIo4/s1600/IMG%5F20140908%5F193954.jpg)

**Zombie Apocalypse Survival Strategies** You just heard on the news that there's a zombie infestation that's spreading across America - you've got 1 hour before it hits you. What do you do?  

This is everyone's favorite thought experiment. Has not yet translated over into the real world, but that's just a matter of time. Technically this is still only partially done. We never wrote down an officially accepted gameplan. 

[![](assets/201-11.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--VFCS2hTIGc/VA5NhdnSKbI/AAAAAAABc0M/SKb6-9pOtR8/s1600/%23201%2B-%2Bmancave%5F650.jpg)

**Man Cave**If my future house has a "Man Cave" of some sort, what would I want in it? This one is fairly new. I haven't done much in the way of this yet. I know I want a home gym, workshop, and probably some sort of bar-type thing. Also I'd want it to be close enough in proximity to friends that we could use it as our main gym. This one is still only partially done. **Thought Experiments I _Want_ To Do** **Aaron's education standards**   

If I rewrote education standards, what things would I ensure we are teaching to tomorrow's adults. **Aaron's Worldwide Society** 

If I were able to magically change history and the infrastructure of the current world and its population, how would I architect it to make for the greatest amount of happiness, healthiness, and general "goodness" for the whole of society and the world. **$1500** 

What's the most fun you can have with a given amount of money, in this case $1500\. I'd probably also do $1, $100, $10,000, $10,000, and $1,000,000.

  
Top 5: Thought Experiments I WON'T Be Doing

5\. How long could I feasibly sit in this chair before I died?  
4\. How you could raise a child to believe he/she was living in the center of some sort of "The Truman Show" type of world?  
3\. What is the fastest possible method to go to jail (without collecting $200)?  
2\. How'd you best survive a fall out of an airplane without a parachute?  
1\. Where is the Holy Grail? Who really killed Kennedy? What's at Area 51?

# Motto: The Regularity

Life gets boring if you let it. You can preclude boringness in millions of ways, some healthier than others. I like to make changes to things. Change systems. Change setups. Change routines. Change sometimes for the sake of change. 

A change I wanted to try out, at least for a while, was making the Column a regular thing. As I mentioned in my post two days ago, I am going to change the update frequency on the Column from "whenever I feel like it" to every Thursday and Sunday.

Seems like a good change. I'm going to try this for a month or so, just to see how it feels.

And now, for something entirely different.

A good friend of mine has an birthday fast approaching. She took some time to reflect on her previous year and decided she wanted to make what she called a "bucket list" for the upcoming year of her life. I decided I like the idea, so I decided to do what I do best: **blatantly and unashamedly copy the idea I like.** 

Here's a sampling of my Bucket List for my 25th Year:
Watch a KU home basketball game
Watch a KU away game
Go to St. Louis for a weekend
Enter in a pool tournament
Enter in a race of some sort
Write an Android application
I want to do all that.

(and, you know, buy a car and get married and stuff)

Just a warning, what follows this line is nerdy and has an admittedly small intended audience.

If you aren't using Google+ already, you should be. That is my standard preface for any Google+ related news. The news is that the Google+ App is getting an update that I'm reasonably excited for. The biggest changes include the removal of the vestigial "Messenger" app and the new optional integration with photos and videos stored in Google Drive. Considering I have a terabyte of Drive space and hate app baggage on my phone, I'm pretty happy.

I just deleted 3.1 paragraphs about other Google+ stuff. This post is wordy. Here's a screenshot of my Google Drive picture folder "2013" in Google+:

Your Google Drive pictures are private until you choose to share them.
I recently watched a video of XKCD author (and one of my personal heroes) Randall Munroe giving a talk at Google (another personal hero, albeit a corporate one). During this talk someone asked him about the name, "'XKCD', what does it mean?" He gave the answer that I already knew, it is meaningless. It's just the name he's always used. We went on to talk about why it is what it is. He said his goal was to find a "unique point in the space of four-character strings". When he was looking for a name, he wanted something that met the following criteria:
No letters could be mistaken for other letters or number in either case
No obvious acronym decoding
Not pronounceable
When you Google it, you only find things that are related to (me)
**I love this idea. So, I decided to blatantly and unashamedly copy the idea I like**.

Here were my base criteria:
* 4 characters, letters only
* No obvious acronyms
* Not pronounceable
* When you Google it, you find less than 10 results
After Googling for a bit I found out there are probably **zero** sets of 4 characters that meet the last criteria alone. Note that I didn't try all 457 thousand possible inputs.

So I relaxed a bit on the first criteria.
* 4 characters, ~~letters only~~ **including numbers**
After Googling things for 20 minutes, I found very few potential strings that returned less than 1 million results. Yes, things like "X2VL" still return 8.6 million results.

So I relaxed a bit more on the first criteria.
* ~~4~~ **5** characters, letters only
After Googling things for 20 minutes, I found out most strings still returned at least 2500 results. Yes, things like "QJKPL" return 3360 results.

So I relaxed even more on the first criteria.
* ~~4~~ **5** characters, ~~letters only~~ **including numbers**
That's gotta do it, right?

The lowest return for a set of 5 letters and numbers I could find was 149 results for the string "J7RX5".

That's still 15 times more results than I wanted, but it's the best to this point.

I'm going to skip a step and say that, according to my experimentation, **to return less than 10 results on a Google search, you need to have at least 6 letters and numbers**. 

If you find out I'm wrong, tell me what string you used. I want it.

Note that all the strings I'm listing anywhere in this post will eventually up the number of results they yield.


# Top 5: Best Strings I Could Feasibly Use

5. **J7RX5** - Returns 149 results
4. **V9Z23** - Returns 107 results (a new low score using 5 characters!)
3. **VZXMWL** - Returns 42 results
2. **K1P3VS** - Returns 3 results, but looks like "Kip, 3, Versus"
1. **AAROGIL** - Returns 5 Google results, but is 7 characters long and isn't meaningless

Motto: Mr. Handy Man Can  
  
My grandpa was a carpenter. My dad builds stuff. It turns out I build some stuff too.  
  
_Am I great?_   
No.  
_Am I capable?_  
Arguably.  
  
My whole life dad took me out to the barn to fix things, build things, and perform various types of maintenance. I don't think he thought I really learned all that much. I did, though. Possibly from his training - or, possibly just through exposure & osmosis. I learned some things you should do, some things you shouldn't do, and how to appreciate what you've done when you're done.  
  
I used some of those things I learned to turn this desk I'm sitting at from a thing that was absolutely perfect for the circumstances which I used to have into something that is absolutely perfect for the circumstances I have now.  
  
This is the desk I'm writing at right now:  

[![](assets/297-1.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--VhY4fj-ldk/V9TINsX9-sI/AAAAAAACbiA/u5F8iiC7C%5FY3j19w2uZ4kQFAzhwhyBRswCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160910%5F201354.jpg)

  
This is that same desk four years ago:  

[![](assets/297-2.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ieqpE8MkxLo/V9TNwMaZeCI/AAAAAAACbj4/vN2o2PKczLYPxivxUxn923H9lI7dULNSACLcB/s1600/%2523297%2B-%2BDesk%2BPre.jpg)

  
It was perfect for me. Huge. Spartan. No annoying drawers to bump my knees on. This desk was my desk, table, entertainment center, and buffet. Times change, though. Now, instead of walls on both sides, I've got a Melissa to my left. She's literally sitting there right now. It felt weird having my desk form an penetrable barrier between us. So I cut a hole in the wall, made us a shelf we can both access:  

[![](assets/297-3.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j8rMazTMeBs/V9TINp6csOI/AAAAAAACbiA/MKhJ28bmQncCVFqvkFH%5FyAUX3Hl8TbllgCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160910%5F201423.jpg)

  
Pretty cool - but I wasn't satisfied yet. The filing cabinet doesn't really fit well in the same spot it used to. It's off in the closet. But I used to use the top drawer of it for desk-related storage. I missed having that drawer. So I decided I wanted to add a drawer to the other side of the "L":  

[![](assets/297-4.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pt7Xj0TWeTI/V9TINlwdswI/AAAAAAACbiA/-y0adepdtU4PKYTUqQND3KxOXh7O-wX3ACKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160910%5F201534.jpg)

  
When that drawer shuts, it nests underneath the corner of the desk, recessed about an inch. It's subtle, yet fits the "BIG, SPARTAN" aesthetic this desk has always had going for it. It's not perfect, but I like it the way it is.  
  
I keep the desktop stored under the desk and plug stuff into it all the time. This gets annoying really quickly. So I added one last small feature:  

[![](assets/297-5.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RW4pyWm76gU/V9TSxjAfFTI/AAAAAAACbkQ/Qm6sTfyYBG4wD%5Fkbmc88lvVaTM%5FfFYBjgCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160910%5F223923.jpg)

  
Those USB cables are permanently plugged into the back of my computer. They sit in holders nested in that hole, ready for me to pull them out when I need them. The cable you see running off the bottom right is attached to my phone, which took the photo. This feature has been incredibly handy. One of the three cables I have sticking up, always ready is a USB extender... even flash drives I can plug in without having to get down under the desk. Sweet.  
  
I really enjoy this stuff. I've enjoyed this stuff for years. Before I ever even bought this desk. Before I got a job at all - back when I lived with mom and dad, I decided to install a desk into a wall in their basement:  

[![](assets/297-6.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KJ1ocSB%5Fb34/V9TULTAW-mI/AAAAAAACbkc/Y2bpjXk148wTSoPdWBYAy0MZesttRCcmwCLcB/s1600/%2523297%2B-%2BOriginal%2BWork.jpg)

  
There used to be a Foosball table sitting there. The desk was much more useful.  
  
Making stuff makes up for some of man points I lost by not being interested in cars, football\*, and/or barbecue\*. It makes me feel like this:  

[![](assets/297-7.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LTKEoeuhnMk/V9TINn1veNI/AAAAAAACbiA/Xef4Kczlt-sxOhX75YFXylumJ-Y7J-sHgCKgB/s1600/download%5F20160910%5F171039.jpg)

  
 \*until recently  
  
Oh and I hung that fan from the first photo. So that's cool.  
  
Top 5: Things I'll be Working On Soonish  
5\. Hanging lights up over my workbench in the garage.  
4\. Hanging a pullup bar in the room that will eventually be a home gym.  
3\. Building dumbbell stands for my adjustable dumbbells.  
2\. Building some organization systems into my workbench.  
1\. Raising my workbench 4-6 inches.

Motto: En Route, En Queue, In English

  
As Danielle pointed out to me this morning:  
  
"No posts for three days?"  
_\- Danielle -_

  
She was right (which tends to happen). You might want to cry foul that I wasn't writing every day as per my 30 day challenge, but I retort to your imaginary argument with "I've written a few _half_ posts that don't add together to any one whole post". Specifically, I've got several Top 5's en queue. I have another post en route. The will all be written in English.  
  
I went to a completely empty gym with my completely empty-headed friend Nick. We made this video:  
  
  
One thing I'd like to note - making that video was the first computer thing I've done on my _actual_ computer since I got this Chromebook. It's been weeks since I needed a computer function that isn't readily doable in the cloud.  
  
It's been too long since I've made a Fight Club reference in a Column. So the picture to go out on will be this:  
  
If I had a Volkswagen Beetle, I'd name it "_Marla_".

Top 5: Projects I'm Waiting to Start

5\. Moving the Life Tracker over to the "new" Google Sheets. This will introduce better performance, but also some compatibility issues I'll have to fix. 4\. Using Duolingo to start learning Spanish with Melissa. 3\. Installing a Linux distro on my laptop and Chromebook. 2\. Learning Android development on said Linux distro. I'm still not sure what I want to make first, but I have a few ideas. 1\. Husbandry.

title: '#386 - Data Journal Pivot'

January's 30 Day Challenge was to refactor the old "Life Tracker" into the "Data Journal" component of my new overall system. I wasn't sure how much effort this endeavor was going to take. It wasn't clear from the outset, but ultimately it was a burn-it-all-down undertaking. 

## In Short:

![[386-1.png]]

## Background

Since the Life Tracker started in April, 2013, it was structured as a standard spreadsheet. Rows and columns. Each row was defined by a given period of time (day/week/month/year, depending on the sheet) and each column was associated with exactly one tracked data type, given by the column Header. 

![[386-2.png]]

This structure offers many advantages. First it's how spreadsheets are *supposed* to be structured. Formulas, pivot tables, and charts all work very nicely. It is familiar and easy to understand for humans and machines. You can use filters and sorting to look for trends. It has been a great, consistent piece of the concept since its inception. 

There's one limitation that a standard spreadsheet applications fails to handle well... a limitation I decided I no longer wanted to live with: multiplicity.

The intersection of a row and a column is one cell. One cell contains one value. One. You can try working around this limitation by using in-cell delimiters (e.g. commas), but you're always fighting an uphill battle. Here's a pretty simple scenario that played out last year - I wanted to know how many books I read. There are formulas for counting things, there are formulas for counting things based on conditions, there are methods of counting "unique" things... but none of those built-in methods can possibly recognize that the sequence of days below only contains two books:

- 1/1: "The Odyssey"  
- 1/2: "The Odyssey, The Iliad"  
- 1/3: "The Iliad"  

This annoyance played out in a multitude of spots. How many books/TV shows/Movies/videogames did I consume? How many of each exercise routine did I do? How many days did I have tagged as "DayOff" and "Friends"?

## The Pivot

In January I changed everything. All I did was change the data structure from a the standard intersection-of-row-and-column format to something more akin to a key:value pair... although in my case it's more of a "couple keys:value" triple.

![[386-3.png]]

The new structure is a big step toward the de-spreadsheet-ification of the whole thing. I chose this methodology over creating a bunch of independent tables for each data type, then joining those into a master table (a SQL-like approach) because cloud service providers (read: Google, Amazon) seem to push new developers toward NoSQL over SQL for cloud-based applications... and the application would work in either format. Because I intend to wind up using their services to host my data, the approach was set for me.

The new approach made things easier, but also more difficult.

### Simplifications:

- Multiple data points may exist for any given period
- All data exist in a common format
- Lookup routines need not worry about which column contains the data
- I can append new data to the Data Journal using a wide variety of applications and triggers, utilizing a common pattern

### Complications:

- Standard spreadsheet formulas don't work well (or at all, in most cases) in a key:value world
- Standard spreadsheet formatting is tedious, conditional formatting is a workaround at best
- Lookup routines now need to worry about which rows contain the data
- It's much less obvious and intuitive to find missing data

It's rare that things can be made better without an associated cost. These costs are ones I'm willing to live with, given the opportunities it affords me for automating inputs and the simplification (from a machine perspective) for grabbing a certain type of data from a certain period.

I end January having achieved pretty much all of the ultimate mission of the whole Data Journal concept: *I want to build a permanently ongoing ledger of notes, measures, metrics, tasks, events, and other data which I can append throughout the day utilizing a number of automated and manual means.*

# Top 5: Enhanced Features, Post Re-write

1. I'm now using a completely custom WebApp interface instead of Google Forms. I can make it look like whatever I want, and pull in data to show in my nightly review.
2. The Data Manifest brought clarity to what I'm tracking & why.
3. I can track multiple little notes throughout the day, and do it as simply as saying "Okay Google, Journal ______" to any Assistant-capable device.
4. Thanks to integration with Siri Shortcuts and automations, I can automatically track anything that can trigger automations on my phone. And I made a homescreen's worth of shortcuts for tracking various types of data.
5. Thanks to the integration with IFTTT, I can automatically track ANYTHING that connects to IFTTT... the impact of this cannot be overstated. I have automatic logging enabled for anytime I leave (or enter) my house, any task I check off in Todoist, any Instagram post I post, and any Column I post. Adding new automations (such as my RescueTime daily screen time summaries) can be done in a matter of seconds.

Motto: Right about now, the funk's your brother.

  
Several years ago I was asked the question "What would you do if you were given a year to do anything you wanted and you didn't have to worry about money?" Before I go on, I want to comment that doing that a _wonderful_ thought exercise and I highly suggest you answer that question for yourself. MY answer was something along the lines of "split that year up into six 2-month sections, spend each of those 2 months operating in an entirely different mode. Live in different parts of the country/world, work different jobs, take up different hobbies. I was and still am satisfied with this answer. I bring up this thought experiment I did because it just occurred to me that my 30 Day Challenges are like miniature versions of that same idea. Every month I'm intentionally exploring new habits and, to a lesser extent, new places. Making that connection was a bit of "aha!" moment. I thought that was cool. Speaking of new places... Melissa and I moved. We elected to continue _renting_ for the duration of Melissa's stent in grad school. We aren't 100% sure where we want to be after she graduates, and I've always heard it's cheaper to something for a few years than it is to buy and sell. There were more factors that went into our decision, but that was the biggest. Another large factor was how much we liked the place we found:

  
[![](assets/235-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F9vh4WUXiXs/VQ2ypwXBGBI/AAAAAAABqPI/1negYppmorM/s1600/IMG%5F20150321%5F122111.jpg)

  
Our new place is awesome. We are treating it more like a permanent residence and less like a place we're crashing at for a year. It's our intention to be here for a while. We love the area. Love the amenities. Love the place. Really I couldn't be happier about the whole thing. Every single detail of this place is by far and away better than our old one... and we've really made it our own. I could write more, and I am tempted to gush, but I'm going to leave it at that. Just for now.

  
Completely counter to that - I have spent the last 2 or 3 weeks in a constant state of fatigue. It didn't really hit me until two days ago when I realized "man, I haven't felt _awake_ in weeks".   
  
Unrelated thought:  

  
I once wrote about "the taxonomy of human attractiveness" - where I compared and contrasted "cute", "hot", "pretty", and "beautiful". It occurs to me that there are other classifications of human traits that could be similarly explored. The most immediate example I can think of is "the taxonomy of human intellect". What is "smart"? How is it different than "educated"? What about "intuitive"? I'm not going to explore this here, but it's something I've thought about lately. Largely because I've realized some people I thought were "smart" were really just "educated", and other people that don't seem all that "educated" are actually really pretty "smart". There are other things that could be formally explored... Funny = clever, quick, and/or goofy... Physical Fitness = strong, athletic, flexible, and/or cardiovascularly sound. Maybe some day I'll build out Venn diagrams like I did in [Column #97](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/06/97-feature-taxonomy-of-human.html).

  
Top 5: Benefits of the New Place

5\. It feels safe... like truly safe. Like, walk around at night and enjoy the weather safe. Like "bye honey, I'm going to ride my bike to the store"-type safe.   
4\. We live within 5 minutes of a ridiculous number of fun things to do:  
  
* A park
* A theater
* Every date restaurant ever
* 3 different grocery stories
* Basically every other kind of store (and their main competitor right across the street)
* Danielle's parents' place (really, the only one on this list that matters)
3\. We live closer to our friends & family.  
2\. The gym is open 24/7, has a workable amount of equipment and space, and usually isn't over crowded. Also the pool table (that's actually good), and the tons of other cool stuff that's offered by our apartment complex fo' free.  
1\. The actual apartment is just much, much nicer. Everything is just a little bigger. There is a place for things, instead of us cramming things where they don't really belong. Plus we have curtains, which is a really big deal.

Motto: This Turned Out to be a Monster

  
I'd like to thank my local library and the various apps ([one](https://www.google.com/search?q=axis+360&rlz=1CAPVCB%5FenUS823&oq=axis+360&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2779j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), [two](https://meet.libbyapp.com/), [three](https://www.rbdigital.com/service/rbdigital) that connect with it for increasing my reading throughput by roughly 95%. [Gillespedia](http://www.gillespedia.com/) has 9 book reports now... sooner or later I'll figure out a way to make them _look_ good. Right now Gillespedia is basically a link to the public-facing portion of my Notion notes.

This Column has been dogging me for weeks. I'm sure it will feel good when it's finished.

  
_Mindfulness._ 

_Being present._

_Intentionality._ 

_Buzzwords._

What do they actually _mean_? The concept of "mindfulness" [has been getting more and more popular](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=mindfulness). I've seen tons [books aimed at mindfulness](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mindfulness), telling you it's the solution to all of life's biggest problems - depression, anxiety, dissatisfaction. The use of the term in marketing drove a Buddhist teacher to coin the term "McMindfulness", describing the commercialization of the philosophy. I'm not going to sit here and try to define any of these terms or say that I know anything about them; but I do think the concepts I'm about to cover are at least _tangentially_ related to what the essence of mindfulness, presence, and intentionality are all about.

## Manageable Stress

It feels bad to be stressed out. It feels _worse_ to be stressed out about something you can't do anything about. It feels **worst** when you're stressed out by a litany of things all unfairly converging on you at the same time, bringing you down in concert with one another like they were a squad of highly trained Navy SEALs here to wreck your day. 

* Your homework is due.
* At the same time you run out of groceries.
* At the same time your car's check engine light comes on.
* At the same time your phone is dying.
* At the same time you realize this light cough you've had is turning into a full-blown head cold.

Wouldn't it be great if it all just, _went away?_ 

No stress forever. _Can you imagine?_

  
You know what? No stress can be just as bad as too much stress. No stress is good for a while, but after a certain point - you'll start to go crazy. You'll start to develop symptoms of depression. You'll start to find little stressors that never used to bother you.

  
> Without rest, a man cannot work; without work, the rest does not give you any benefit. - proverb

  
I think the best thing you can hope for is to have the right _amount_ of stress. A life with no problems is not possible. If you have no problems for long enough, you're going to find you have one really big problem and it's developing between your ears in the spot of your human brain that says "hey, go solve a problem". Humans were not designed to be content with nothing changing long-term. We see problems. We solve them. We feel good about having solved them, then move onto the next problems. **There's almost nothing as universally satisfying as solving a problem.** If you're lucky, or if you've managed your life well, you can have the _right kind_ of problems. The ones that are fun to solve. The ones that can really make a difference.  

### Life = Time x Energy

It's a cliche these days to say _"life isn't measured in seconds"_. While that's almost certainly true, I think it's up to the individual to define life. For me, it feels like life is roughly equal to the things I spend the most time and energy doing. Stuff I don't do regularly and stuff I don't care about sort of just fall by the wayside. At the end of the day, I don't think about the number of seconds I spent bored or whatever amusing thing I saw on TV... I choose to define life by those things that ignite my passion, or at least capture my full attention. Those are the things that make up Aaron.

  
Note that "energy" could probably be substituted with "focus". Focus is just the energy of the domain of the mind. Also note that, while money isn't part of the equation, it does expand the realm of opportunities from which you can choose to spend your time & energy.

### Getting Things Done

Solving problems is inherently a good, satisfying feeling. Doing that thing you have to get done feels good. It's not only the _having it done afterward_ that feels good, it is often _the actual act of doing the thing_ that feels good. Even if that thing is renewing your driver's license. If you're doing it for a _reason_, you can find some level of satisfaction in the task. 

  
To that end, it's good to truly understand the things you have to do. What tasks do you have? Why do you have them? What are the accomplishing? How do they relate to one another? The best way to know these things is to manage and keep track of your tasks by putting them in a list. 

* Lists allow you to make logical connections between tasks.
* Lists can help make clear the meaning behind the task.
* Lists ensure nothing important falls off the table or through the cracks.

Organization is about having a place for everything, and everything in it's place. Organization of _information_ essentially boils down to "make a list" and eventually "make a list of your lists". 

  
To have an organized personal task-killing system, you should have a primary **Inbox**. A temporary holding place where tasks can land until you've managed them. You managed them by _doing_ them, _scheduling_ them, and/or organizing them in the context of a set of related tasks (i.e. - adding them to a project's task list).

  
There one more benefit to be reaped by a person with an Inbox... **an Inbox can free your mind**. If you remember you have to get your engine light checked out while you're looking for cold & flu medicine, it will be a distraction. Distractions are stressful. Worse, it can be a distraction that won't go away - because you'll have the nagging feeling of unresolved tasks, loose ends to one string in a mess of strings all knotted up between the different areas of your life. Now you're distraction that won't go away is a stressor that won't go away. If you have an inbox that you trust and you write down "search for repair shops", and "make appointment to get engine light checked", suddenly you'll find your mind is free to move on to other things.

#### The Weekly Review

In order to _truly trust_ that your Inbox and task management list system will do its job, you need to review it regularly. The Inbox can be managed on an hour-by-hour basis, but at least once a week it is good to sit down and intentionally and systematically look at everything on every list you have. Do you need to do something about it right now? Do you need to schedule it? Is it still relevant?

  
Honestly I can, could, and _should_ write an entire post on the concept of a "Weekly Review". Maybe I'll add this idea to my _"Column Topics"_ list. In the meantime, you can read [a fellow (much better than I) blogger's takes on the Weekly Review](http://www.markwk.com/2016/01/power-of-weekly-review.html). 

### Monotasking

It is _incredibly difficult_ to do more than one thing at a time. Some people have said it's outright _impossible_ and that true multitasking is a myth. I'm not sure I fully believe that, but I do fully believe that doing one thing at a time is almost always going to be more rewarding and produce better work.

If you were stuck for an evening in a blank white room with a pencil and a piece of paper with the heading "In the next 5 years...", I believe you'd produce a pretty good 5 year plan. If you were stuck in the same room with a pencil, a piece of paper with the heading "in the next 5 years...", _and_ a social media-connected computer and a television, I believe you'd sort of half think about what you want to do in the future for a bit, then half pay attention to your computer and half watch whatever was on the TV. 

### Distraction & Minimalism

There's a problem with the sentence above this section heading. I said you'd sort of do one thing while half doing another and half doing a 3rd. Those numbers don't add up. I think more accurate figure would look something like this:

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| While making this graphic, "Wondering why you're anxious" and "Wondering why your anxiety is mounting" somehow became "Wondering you're anxiety is mounting". Now fixing it would take too much energy.                                                                          |

  
The thing you're supposed to be doing is barely there, but the things you _think_ you're doing instead don't actually make up the rest of the pie... you're not half doing two things. You're 30% doing two things, and the other 40% of your mind and attention are aimlessly wandering around. There's a time and a place for aimlessly wandering attention... but when you've got something that you're actively trying to get done - that's _not_ the time.

  
I said earlier it feels good to get things done. It feels _great_ to get things done when you're using your entire brain, through consistently maintained _focus_. If you're truly focused on a task, everything else in the world sort of melts away. Other problems don't exist. Time doesn't pass. You're in the zone. You're in what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls "_flow"_. Doing what Cal Newport calls "Deep Work". That's a great feeling - and it's a feeling I know and crave decently often.

### Distraction & Boredom

You can't sustain flow if you are distracted out of it. If you're solving a math problem or _way_ deep into the code and your phone goes off saying an old friend liked your most recent Instagram, suddenly you find yourself wondering "why did he like that picture? was he just wanting to make contact or was it something about the photo itself? What was the photo again?" This whole train of thought probably would only take a few seconds... but it would pull you out of a spot that takes several _minutes_ to get back into. 

  
Worse yet, we are **constantly distracted**. We are constantly receiving stimulation from various screens and alarms that we carry in our pockets or on our wrists. _(You can see for yourself just how bad it is with the digital well-being feature on your smartphone... or install RescueTime on your phone & computer to get a more complete view.)_ We, as a culture, have been working to eradicate _boredom_ from our lives... and that's **_not_** a good thing. Boredom is unpleasant. I'm reminded of [a psychological study in which study participants were left in a boring room with a button that shocked them](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28130690). They weren't to "entertain themselves with their own thoughts" and that pressing the button would give them a mild, but still painful shock. Eventually, nearly _half_ of those in the study pushed the button. One guy pushed it 190 times, apparently.

  
And yet, boredom is one of the base states that our brains have evolved around. It activates a portion of the brain called the "neutral" circuit, which may be a key portion of the brain when it comes to laterally thinking about you and your position in the world. Some of my best revelations have come to me only after long periods of relatively _low_ stimulation. 

  
You won't go anywhere if your mind isn't free to wander from time to time.

### Minimalism

Minimalism is often misunderstood. Minimalism isn't about getting rid of everything. It's not about not appreciating things. It's about really knowing what things you _do_ appreciate, and not letting other things that don't cultivate that same sense of appreciation (or "Spark Joy" in Mari Kondo's words) rob you of your time and energy. It may not seem like having too many pairs of shoes would rob you of time and energy, but _stuff_ has a way of doing that.

  
It's a bit embarrassing as a 31 year old to quote Fight Club in a serious context, but I am reminded of the line from (I _think_ only) the movie:

>  
>> _The things you own end up owning you. - Tyler Durden_

Maintenance is not fun. It's necessary to sustain an object's utility, but it is often times just a chore to do. If you have a _lot_ of objects, especially a lot of _similar_ objects achieving _similar_ purposes, each one is diluted by the existence of the others. The problem is that, unfortunately, the law of diminishing returns only applies to the _benefits_ of the thing you have a lot of... it doesn't necessarily similarly apply to the maintenance costs (time/energy/money) of those things. Minimalists don't under-appreciate stuff. The appreciate stuff more than regular people, and respect the role of that stuff in their lives. 

  
Minimalism extends to more than just physical possessions. Digital minimalism is all about being intentional with the apps and services you regularly maintain. I am not a Facebook user. Not because I'm holier-than-thou, but because the kind of expression I like to produce doesn't go well on a _Facebook_... it goes here. The fewer platforms you're on, the fewer chances you'll have of being pulled away from some high-value activity to manage some low-value notification on your phone. 

  
This month's 30 Day Challenge is all about being more intentional with my phone and computer. I haven't been on Reddit in over a week... and look at me getting around to actually writing this beast of a Column.

  
### The Hedonic Treadmill

If you've never heard of the Hedonic Treadmill, here's a quick definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic%5Ftreadmill):

  
The **hedonic treadmill**, also known as **hedonic adaptation**, is the observed tendency of [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") to quickly return to a relatively stable level of [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness "Happiness") despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

  
The reason I've think about the Hedonic Treadmill is that I've had enough life experiences now to say that I can appreciate it. I've gone to college. Got a job. Got married. Had a kid. Bought a house. And through it all... pretty much I've felt like the same old Aaron. My baseline for comfort and joy has _absolutely_ changed... but my relative day-to-day levels of happiness are probably on par with what they've always been. Luckily, I'm pre-disposed to being generally pretty happy.

  
Alternatively you could say "of course you're happy you moron. Did you even read [this](http://www.aarongilly.com/154)? Look at the list of things you just said. Shut up." That's fair. I bring up the Hedonic Treadmill _mostly_ because it will come into play later.

### Stoicism

Stoicism is all about knowing the natural human experience and accepting it for what it is. A stoic does not concern himself with troubles he has no power to resolve. A stoic is not overly worried about coming pain, nor do they expend great efforts in the pursuit of pleasure. I think of stoics as incredibly pragmatic naturalists, whose believe heavily in maintaining a healthy balance in all things. They seek understanding, and believe that true happiness and contentment come from seeing their place in the bigger picture. A stoic wouldn't be upset by the knowledge that he is on the Hedonic Treadmill. I think I'm naturally fairly stoic, and aspire to be moreso. 

### Utopia

Stoicism is all well and good - it's nice not to have to worried with constantly being pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain... but man wouldn't it be good if we just lived in a world where pleasure was abound and pain was all-but-eradicated?

  
No such world can possibly exist. 

Not one filled with humans, at least. 

  
Humans, as we know them today, come from a long evolutionary line of animals that saw problems in and with their environment, and worked to resolve those. The ones who did this most effectively were given a selective advantage and passed on their genes more frequently. As generations progress and progress, it becomes more of an in-grained tendency pre-built in all of us. 

  
**As I've already talked about, if take away all the known problems, we humans will invent new ones. That's what we do. If you are given constant joy and stimulation and back rubs or _whatever_... you'll stop appreciating any of it. The Hedonic Treadmill will put you right back to that baseline - and worse yet, how do you go _up_ from there?** 

  
So if Utopia is impossible, and every solved problem just leads to new problems, should we all just give up?

  
### The Merger of Biotech and Infotech

I think there's hope for a (nearly) universally perfect society in our future... way out in the horizon. Or _maybe_ that's mass catastrophe on a scale we've never seen. 

Who knows. 

  
This is largely in response to a couple of currently on-going revolutions in biological technology and information technology. 

  
Biotech is creating more and more advanced treatments for disease. [The average life expectancy is going up, and we expect that trend to continue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/LifeExpectancy.png). Also - we are developing sensors that are getting closer and closer to achieving direct, real-time measurements of the human brain. [Seriously](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-implants-mind-reading-artificial-intelligence). Along with those enhanced sensors, we are more and more better at understanding the levers that drive human emotions and behavior.

  
At the same time, Infotech has seen an absolute _explosion_ in recent years in machine learning and computer intelligence. We went from a [human vs machine rivalry in chess that lasted nearly 30 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer%5Fchess%5Fmatches) before humans were truly left in the dust to a computer that taught itself how to play Go in about a year. Moreover, the machines that are currently the top-ranked "Go" players in the world learned how to play 100% by themselves. Meanwhile, big data has become more and more pervasive in its use. Exponentially more data is generated every decade. Decades aren't even the right timeframe for this, each _day_ [we are producing 2.5 quintillion bytes of data.](https://web-assets.domo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17%5Fdomo%5Fdata-never-sleeps-5-01.png) That's 2.5EB. You've never seen "EB" before because it's Exabytes... a level of data that's incredibly massive. [Wolfram|Alpha estimates](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.5+quintillion+bytes) that figure to be roughly twice the amount of information carried in every word ever spoken by anyone. 

  
Now think about the combination of biotech and infotech. Right now artificial intelligence is tagging cats in our pictures for us... but soon it may very well be actively implementing optimizations in the drug cocktails or environmental stimuli that it sees best fit to soothe an ailing brain. We could quite literally maximize the human experience. We could figure out a way _off_ the Hedonic Treadmill and make actual consistent and forward progress that builds upon itself with time... and we'll have time, because we'll have figured out how to stop unnecessary deaths from disease. Or possibly we will have figured out how to cure death altogether, either through some miracle biological means or through the passing of human consciousness from our biological "wetware" to silicon hardware. If what makes you _you_ is uploaded into a chip, and that chip is capable of running off energy directly from the electrical grid (or, say, the _sun_ or any other renewable energy source), you could be stored in RAM, put on a spaceship, and sent throughout the galaxy with a fleet of robot shells that you could be distilled into when you reach your destination on planet whatever. It doesn't matter if it takes 100s of thousands of years to get there, to you it might be the blink of an eye... and suddenly humanity has the entire universe as its playground. Our immortal souls are distributed throughout the universe, making use of all available energy and matter in the universe, making the whole of humanity effectively God. 

  
Or, more likely, we'll figure out a way to use these technologies to wipe ourselves out of existence. Who knows.

  
Sleep well. I'm glad this one is done.

  
Top 5: Productivity Books I've Read & What They Say

**5\. The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carol**

Surprisingly a lot of philosophical stuff. The Bullet Journal Method _does_ teach the actual Bullet Journal Method (a particular approach to life management via dot-grid journals), but also dedicates probably \~1/2 the book to topics such as "happiness", "meaning", and "imperfection".  
**4\. Bored and Brilliant by Manoush Zomorodi**  
We have nearly eradicated boredom from our lives with the invention of the smart phone & other technologies. Boredom is a necessary part of a happy human. It allows us to think deeply and creatively. You can and should cultivate more boredom in your life through a set of 7 challenges, "don't use your phone while in motion" for example.  
**3\. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**

Habits are important. The are comprised of a cue, a routine, and a reward. Pay attention to your habits. It is usually possible to replace bad habits with good ones by finding a different routine to apply after a cue to achieve a similar reward.  
**2\. Deep Work by Cal Newport**

Deep Work, a.k.a. "Flow" is working with an intense focus on a well-defined discrete goal, away from distraction. Deep Work is only getting more valuable and more rare. Deep Work also brings a great amount of satisfaction into your life. The book suggests several methods to improve the quantity and quality of your deep work. Bonus - I also read Cal Newport's "Digital Minimalism", which is a very-related book that expands on "intentionality" and suggests more ways to ensure you have time to do deep work. It's very similar in message to Manoush Zomorodi's "Bored and Brilliant".  
**1\. Getting Things Done by David Allen**

Specify tasks in terms of discrete actions, put them in a list, look at the list frequently enough to trust it. Don't use your head to remember stuff. Cultivate an "external brain", which basically consists of lists & logs. Goes very well with Ryder Carol's "The Bullet Journal Method". David Allen actually wrote a forward in "The Bullet Journal Method" talking about how good it is.

Motto: Knowledge = Voltage × Current! 

  
This column is going to be fun, but first you've got to earn that fun through some learning. I'm going to start this post off with a lesson about one of the most useful-in-the-real-world mathematical concepts I ever learned. Today, we're going to look at **dimensional analysis**.   
  
The word "dimension" has several different definitions. When it comes to math and science, I tend to think of "dimensions" as all the independent variables of a problem. In other words, all of the things you can change without changing anything else.   
  
**Easy example:** Longitude, Latitude, Altitude   
You if you're on an elevator, you're changing your altitude without changing your longitude and altitude. Altitude is a different dimension than the other two. Similarly, you could walk directly towards the North Pole and change your latitude without changing your longitude. These are _dimensions_.   
  
Dimensions are measured in _units_. Engineering (or, perhaps, science in general) is math + units. When you introduce units into math, you transcend the abstract. 3 bananas + 2 bananas = 5 bananas. I like that better than 3 + 2 = 5\. Often times, in real world problems, you can utilize units to direct your math.   
  
**You travel 100 miles 5 hours. What was your average speed?**  
  
Speed is length divided by time (meters/seconds or miles/hours).   
So, to figure out speed, we see that we have to divide miles by hours. 100 {miles} / 5 {hours} = 20 {miles/hour}.   
  
But what if the question was this:   
**You travel 528000 feet in 300 minutes. What was your average speed?**  
  
Well, it's technically a correct answer to say 528000 {feet} / 300 {minutes} = 1760 {feet/minute}... but that's not really useful. We want to get our answer in units we can _understand_.   
  
We can get around this by utilizing a trivial mathematical concept, applied in a clever way.   
  
**These two things are true, regardless of what "A" is:**  
A × 1 = A   
and   
A / A = 1   
  
You can multiply _anything_ by 1, and still have that thing. You can divide _anything_ by itself and get 1\.   
  
Here's the tricky part:   
60 {minutes} = 1 {hour}   
and   
5280 {feet} = 1 {mile}   
  
Thus:   
(60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) = 1   
and   
(1 {mile} / 5280 {feet}) = 1   
  
So, you can multiply _anything_ by (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) and still get that thing (just expressed in terms of new units). You can do the same thing with (1 {mile} / 5280 {feet}).   
  
Applying this A × 1 = A concept, utilizing the fact that (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) = (5280 {feet} / 1 {mile}) = 1, we can can solve our problem:   
  
(1760 {feet/minute}) × 1 × 1   
\= (1760 {feet/minute}) × (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) × (1 {mile} / 5280 {feet})   
\= (1760 × 60 {feet × minutes × miles}) / (5280 {minutes × hours × feet})   
\= (105600 {~~feet~~ × ~~minutes~~ × miles}) / (5280 {~~minutes~~ × hours × ~~feet~~})   
**\= 20 {miles/hour}**  
  
Dimensional analysis is basically just the process of making the units work out (or, checking if your process ends with the correct units). You convert units by cleverly mulitplying by 1 many times in many ways. You can extend this concept into much more difficult problems.   
  
If the first question was so simple you just said "well this isn't useful, I could just do that in my head". Then this harder is for you:   
  
**If a person drinks X liters of water per day, and you have Y people stranded on an island, for how many weeks (Z) can the people stay hydrated on the island (in terms of X & Y)?**  
  
We have X, measured in {liters/(days × persons)} and Y, measured in {persons}. We need Z, measured in {weeks}. We know 1 week = 7 days, so we can do unit conversion easily.   
  
**Z {weeks} = 1/7XY {liters/(day\*persons)} 7 {days/week} × Y {persons} = 7XYZ {liters}**  
  
In school and in real life I have done tons of things like this. You'll see some fake/fun examples in a second.   
  
**\*\*\*LEARNING COMPLETE\*\*\*LEARNING COMPLETE\*\*\*LEARNING COMPLETE\*\*\***  
  
Here is some fun with dimensional analysis:   
  
**House of Cards:**

  
* I estimate that 1 out of every 8 houses in the United States has a deck.
* There are 52 cards in a standard deck.
   * 1 {deck} / 8 {houses} × 52 {cards} / 1 {deck} = 6.5 {cards/house}
* Thus - **a house of cards must be made from an average of 6.5 cards.**
  
This is hard. I'm going to do one more and get over it. I've tried SEVERAL (see the Top 5) that haven't worked out so well.

  
This one is a little more strict - this equality does actually work mathematically - even if it's meaningless:

* [Dietary calories in a Taco Bell bean burrito](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=21264): 386 calories
* [Speed limit on the Kansan interstates](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article1067157.html): 75 miles per hour
* [Average human height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo%5Fsapiens): 66 inches
* [Fastest "healthy" weight loss](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752): 1.5 pounds per week
   * [386 dietary calories / (75 miles per hour \* 66 inches \* 1.5 lbs/week) = 2.55×10^10](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=386+dietary+calories+%2F+%2875+miles+per+hour+%2A+66+inches+%2A+1.5+lbs%2Fweek%29)
* Calories in a Taco Bell bean burrito / (speed limit on the Kansan interstates × average human height × fastest 'healthy' weight loss) \~= [1/4 the total population of all humans who've ever lived](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.55%C3%9710%5E10&lk=1&a=ClashPrefs%5F%2AMath-%27).

For this post I took great inspiration from the author of XKCD, who [has basically done a more accurate version of this exact same thing before](https://xkcd.com/687/):

# Motto: Hasta La Vista, homework

Apparently my tablet's Blogger app doesn't support colored text. I guess it will be pretty obvious which columns I write on my computer and which I write on some Android device. Speaking of Blogger and mobile devices - blogger natively supports a "built for mobile" version of your blog. Looking at this on my phone is actually very pleasant. I like that.

Another off-topic thing before I get to my main point for this column: I was playing around on Google Earth with my girlfriend last night. She was showing me places in Thailand she went to on her tablet. We were flying through the air looking at the lay of the land, 3-dimensional buildings, and many of the millions of photos available of pretty much every landmark you could think of. In doing this I realized, Google has given every single person with access to it superpowers. It might be a stretch to call them superpowers, but if you were to tell me when I was a kid that I'd be able to see anyplace in the world in a matter of minutes, I would have told you I must have become super-human. Later I would have been super disappointed.

Okay, onto the main event:

I just finished the LAST HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT I AM EVER GOING TO GET (assuming I don't go to grad school eventually... which I may). Fittingly, it took me 4 hours and 5 sheets of paper to do it. I'm pretty sure I did every question correctly, so that's good. I wondered for years what it would feel like after I finished my last assignment. Would I set it down, stand up, and raise my fist triumphantly in the air? Would a tear of sadness fall onto the page? Would I dance the dance of passage? Or, would I go out for celebration?

I did none of those things. I smiled. Filed it away to be turned in. Walked to my bed with my tablet. Wrote this.

I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

I guess it could also be due to the research papers I have yet to finish that are due this coming week. I have a really good start on them, but most of them aren't finished. Maybe after I finish those I'll raise my fist in the air triumphantly.

# Motto: Float On

Before I get started recapping my recent adventures, here's something to think about:

**How are you?**

Really, how are you doing right now? You okay? Not angry, at least. Not doing terrible by any means. Right?

Now stop and remember all those times in your life that somebody did something that just really made you mad. Think about all those days were you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Your day was bad and you just couldn't get over it. Think about every time you've been so cold you never thought you'd warm up, or so hot you thought you were on fire and couldn't ever cool off. All those times you've been so sick that you forgot what it was like to feel healthy. 

Now, realize that all of that stuff is in the past. They don't matter any more. They are not important. They came and they went and you are just fine. 

Next time you are upset at something or someone, ask yourself if it is really worth it. 

This weekend I went fishing with a bunch of guys I don't see nearly often enough. I don't fish very often. I'm not a good fisherman. I'm an okay photographer and a decent videographer, so I spent probably half the time doing that instead. I came back with 40.7 gigabytes in photos and videos. That's 426 photos (mostly at 13MP) and over 5 hours of video (all at 1080p).

I caught a fish, which I've done before. I also cleaned the fish, which I had never done before. I was much more capable of handling it than I had anticipated. The hardest part was keeping the thing from sliding around. I almost lost down to the gorey hole (what we called the hole where you deposit the heads and guts) on multiple occasions.

The fish is in my freezer. I'm going to try my hand at cooking him tonight. What I'm more excited about, though, are the photos and videos I have from the trip. Melissa said she liked how I embedded the photosphere a 2 columns ago, so here's my favorite photosphere from the trip:

[Editor's note: This Video Lost to Time]

If you look closely at the tree that stands by itself, you will see my GoPro hanging upside down from one of its lower limbs. That will come into play in a bit.

And here is the fishing highlight video I cut together last night:

Motto: Darn.

  
Google I/O 2015 happened yesterday. I wrote in my last Column about my hopes to walk away from it without disappointment. Unfortunately, it didn't even take the whole keynote for me to realize that's exactly what I'd be doing. Maybe I built up the hype too much... or maybe Google just failed to deliver like they used to. The Top 5 speaks to my disappointment with the keynote.  
  
Temporarily focusing on the positives - there were _some_ good things announced:  
* Google Photos unlimited storage for any photo up to 16MP & video up to 1080p.
* Android Pay is coming (eventually). It looks like a clone of Apple Pay; and that's not a bad thing.
* Google Maps offline will eventually get business information & turn-by-turn navigation. This is _huge_ boon for anyone travelling abroad.
* Lots of goodies for people in developing countries. Not so great for _me_, but still a positive.
* USB Type C will become the standard for all Android phones in the future.
* Udacity is now offering an Android Developer Nanodegree. This is awesome news.
* Google's Polymer and Android Studio development platforms have coming updates.

That's the highlights from my notes.   
  
**May's 30 Day Challenge** was to "not be on your phone when spending time with your wife". According to Melissa, I showed a diminishing level of success throughout the month. Intentionally putting down my phone when she was talking didn't cause the world to explode (which was a risk I was taking).  
  
**June's 30 Day Challenge:**  
Eat out ONLY IF with friends.  
Subsidary goal:  
  
Try out "meal prepping", which is apparently a whole subculture of its own.  
  
I'm going to leave it at that.

Top 5: Disappointments from Google I/O

5\. About one-third of the content "announced" at Google I/O was old news. The "new" Google Photos app is basically just the _old_ Google+ Photos app, without the "+" and with a slightly updated interface. The "new" Android Wear 5.1 demo just showed off what most Android watches already do (not _mine_ yet, but most others already have the update). They talked about Android Auto and Android TV, but didn't say a single _new_ thing about it. There was 10 to 15 minutes dedicated to the history of Google Now before they got to its one new feature. Android M brings almost zero "sexy" new features.   
4\. No new hardware. I know this is a **software** developer's conference, but most people expected _something_ new for developers to write software _for_. Chromecast 2\. Nexus 5 (2015). Android Player 2.0\. A "Nexus" head unit for Android Auto. Any of those would have been great.  
3\. No updates to Hangouts. Not even a _mention_ of Hangouts. It is missing some fairly obvious features and is widely lamented by the Google fanboy community. We all hoped for an overhaul. I would have settled for a mention.  
2\. They tried to sell some pretty blatant lies. Google Photos is "an entirely new product"? The Nest smoke detector was "very successful"? Android TV has been a "great success"? If you tried to make those arguments in a group of nerds, you'd probably be the only one on your side.  
1\. Mostly, the lack of things that make an immediate difference in my life. Google Photos aside, everything announced at I/O won't be available for several months to come. I'll wait.

Motto: New Year, Same General Idea  
  
There's not much time to write this. My laptop is dying. It's already fairly late.  
  
Last year my resolution was to run 12 "challenges" concurrently. Eventually 30 Day Challenges sounded much better than the same 12 things I was trying (and mostly failing) to do. This year I'll be going back to the 30 Day Challenge thing. Otherwise, I don't have any specific resolutions. The ones I've been thinking of generally fall under the following 4 C's:  
  
Control.  
Comfort.  
Competency.  
Captain.  
  
Control - I want to assert better control over everything in life. Money. Time. Energy.  
Comfort - I want less of it. Cause that's how you grow.  
Competency - in everything I want to be good at. Intentionally.  
Captain - be more like Captain America.  
  
That's really the only one that matters.

Top 5: My Favorite Movie Scenes (off the top of my head)  
5\. Any scene with Tom Cruise in "Tropic Thunder".  
4\. The last fight between Tyler Durden & the narrator.  
3\. The Avengers coming together for the first time to wreck the Chitauri.  
2\. The scene from Rouge One. If you've watched the movie, you know which one. It was phenomenal.  
1\. The airport scene from Civil War.

Motto: This Column is about Nothing

  
This is the first of a one-two punch. I wrote too much for one post, so I broke it up. There will be another post tomorrow... that was written today. 

  
Every person has their own writing style. Ever Ye Purse sin haste air roan rye tin sty ell. I seriously considered writing a whole Column like that one time. When I realized how terribly annoying it was to decipher, I abandoned my plan. My writing style is apparently pretty obvious in the Column. I write with a distinct "voice". It's a quality that I've never fully understood, but have been accused of for my entire writing career. Yes. I have a writing career. I'm allowed to use those words in that fashion. I'm allowed to because I have a writing career. Circular logic works because circular logic works. This is a part of my writing style: Rad Lad's bad dad's sad CAD pad fad had Lad a tad mad. As is this: (nothing goes here, I was just pointing out that "as is this:" is very much something Aaron would say) There are other pieces of text that should tip you off that I wrote them. Things like this: Something something Thor something Android something Google GoPro something math something science something Apple something phone phone phone something Avengers something something the word "I" the word "I" something colon something Nalgene something something EDC bag something Timbuk2 something big word every once in a while something typo something. Ooo! Aaron must have written that!

  
**Every post has to have a picture. Here's a picture of all the weapons I own, arranged in ascending order of power:**

Top 5: Words I've Never Used on the Column (until now)

Motto: Whoever said "You can never go back" clearly didn't put in the effort

  
Melissa and I are in Lawrence in preparation for her brother's marching band competition. We decided to come a bit early and hang out in the place we met. Things are different. All the sudden nothing is the same and I'm old and that's scary. All these young kids with their compact disc players and their radio cellular telephones. They have no respect for themselves or the society I once knew.

  
We are in the _new_ public library. They tore the old one down about a year after we left. Then they built this beautiful, modern, public workspace in its place. I hate to admit I'm not much of a reader. I consider that fact one of the flaws of my character. But I adore libraries. Or, should I say, I adore the _idea_ of libraries. Publicly available information, knowledge, and entertainment, all for free. The library is the internet before the internet existed. Unfortunately, most public libraries I've seen are looked at more as a warm spot to sit by its patrons. This library manages to subvert that trope, at least in part.

  
Alright, enough about where I am and all that. Today is the first day of a new month - that means I finished a 30 Day Challenge and began a new one!

  
**The October Project:**   
  
The Incredible Bulk  
  
**Average Daily Intakes**  
**Calories**  
October: 3024   
Normally: 2680  
% Change: +12.8%

  
**Fats**  
October: 104.6   
Normally: 99.3  
% Change: +5.3%  
  
**Carbs**  
October: 328.5   
Normally: 302.3  
% Change: 8.6%  
  
**Protein**  
October: 166.3   
Normally: 136.3  
% Change: +21.9%  
  
\- also -  
  
**Number of Workouts Per Month**  
October: 12   
Normally: 5.9  
% Change: +103%  
**Weight**  
October (end): 232 lbs  
September (end): 225 lbs   
\# Change: +7 lbs  
Overall, it seems like a pretty resounding success. The extra weight seems to have gone to mostly the right places, which is cool. I'm really happy with the increased workout frequency. I started a new training routine called "German Volume Training", which is basically just "do tons of reps with light weight". This is vastly different than the "do a few reps with heavy weight" that I've done for the past \~3 years. I'm still sore from Tuesday's 100 Squats, 100 Roman Deadlifts, and 100 Calf Raises. That was 5 days ago.  
  
I will probably continue the bulk for a while. I'm hoping to get to 240\. 240 then maintain.  
  
**The November Project:**  
  
Budgeting   
  
I don't suck at money management by any means. I've never been in debt. I don't make purchases I can't actually swing. But Melissa is going back to school soon and we're going to try living on my salary - with two cars and hopefully a house payment to make. I don't put as much away in savings as I would like. This month, I'm going to fix that.  
  
Also, probably not going to get into too much detail about my budgets and what not on the Column. It's impolite to discuss finances. Plus I think most people reading this make more money than me.  
  
One last thing.  
  
Yesterday was Halloween. Two weeks ago I was all set and ready to dress up as BoJack Horseman from the Netflix series BoJack Horseman.  
  
[![](assets/215-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--iRz8wW7NjU/VFVSiQJyhtI/AAAAAAABgMQ/FrrANwGRqEg/s1600/%23215%2B-%2Bbojack.jpg)

  
That's BoJack. Here is my amazing awesome totally-not-just-from-a-thrift-shop costume:  
  
[![](assets/215-2.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FB%5FgbpREz-s/VFVTCabx6kI/AAAAAAABgMc/H7aFHM9e5ck/s1600/IMG%5F20141013%5F173732.jpg)

  
Nailed it.  
  
But.  
  
Melissa and I went out shopping for her costume a week later. We stumbled across a "cat woman" suit. But, with Melissa's new redish-blackish-awesome hair color, she looked more like the Black Widow. Naturally, I jumped on the idea of my wife dressing up like one of the Avengers. My BoJack Horseman costume no longer made sense, though. Why was Mrs. Gillespie dressed up as an Avenger, but Mr. Gillespie not? I had to call a audible. After some frantic searching, I found the raw material to make a costume. A few days and several hours' worth of work later: we were ready for Halloween.

I think we were the Belle of the ball.  

Top 5: Other Things We Could Have Dressed Up As

5\. Bonnie and Clyde (Bonnie Swanson and Clyde Drexler)  
4\. Mr. & Mrs. Smith from the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
3\. A monkey wrench and a banana spider  
2\. Bella & Edward, but not vampires, just normal people  
1\. A pinball wizard and a ditch witch

Motto: I Voted  
  
I hated economics in school. It was a boring subject. The study of supply and demand was too demanding. Interest rates didn't interest me. The law of diminishing returns got less and less cool the more I learned about it.  
  
Then a dozen years went by. Things changed.  
  
Now I like economics, but it's it's not because I suddenly find supply and demand fascinating. Interest rates still don't interest me. The parts of economics I like aren't those communicated in the simple example problems teaching the fundamental truths of economics. I like to think about marginal cost and reward, the concepts of value and utility, and how economics applies to me as an individual, not a business.  
  
I just got a phone. It's expensive, but it's also the single device I use more than any other. If your phone costs $1000 and you use it 2 hours a day for 2 years, that's $0.68/hour. It also replaces any number of other devices you would otherwise need to spend money on. Moreover, it has more utility than a lot of those devices, because it's always on you.  
  
My natural instinct is to use this same train of thought to reiterate how I think automobiles are stupid and because you pay $10,000+ for thing your only use for \~1 hour a day, but the utility of vehicles isn't the time you spend in them, it's the capability a vehicles gives you. If you live in a place with good public transit or Uber or whatever, you may consider if having a car of your own is worth it.  
  
I digress.  
  
I'm starting a podcast with a couple of friends of mine. We talk about movies and stuff. We've recorded 3 episodes, two of which will be available at some point in the not-too-distant future on podcast apps near you. When that becomes a reality, I'll tell you more about it and how to get it.  
  
This segues into both of my remaining topics for this Column.  
  
Avengers 4 has no trailer yet. That's a bummer. For hot takes like that, tune in to my upcoming podcasts.   
  
That was topic 1 of 2\. Here's me picking back up the segue.  
  
I spent a couple weeks researching how to best record multi-threaded audio simultaneously. There are a ton of options - you can go super cheap and just use apps on a phone, spend a lot of money on a portable XLR recorder, utilize a mixer to combine several microphones to a single USB port, or just connect several USB microphones to several ports. Ultimately, we were just the right amount of particular, cheap, & stupid to decide that phones sounded too crappy, portable recorders are to expensive, mixers are too confusing, and several USB mics + GaragevBand fit juuuust right.  
  
So that's what I've been using. Apple's free Garage Band software on my wife's Mac computer. It was eye-opening. It was probably the final straw that pushed me over the edge to do something I've been thinking about forever (and written about [4 years ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/174)...  
  
I got an iPhone.  
  
Actually that should probably just be a Column of its own.

Top 5: Ways to Maximize Value  
5\. Buy in bulk  
4\. "Measure twice, cut once", but in terms of thinking about buying a thing  
3\. Don't buy a thing that's only got one use  
2\. Don't buy a crappy thing twice, buy a good thing once  
1\. Learn how to do everything you possibly can with what you have

Motto: 13-Across, a 7 letter word for "Mrs. Gillespie"

  
Enough of this "Writing _abou_t something". I started this blog with the intention to write about _nothing..._ where did I get so focused on _accomplishing things_ with my writing? This blog is supposed to be full of things like the following:

  
"I imagine if you were a giraffe and you had a sore throat, that would suck."

\- Mitch Hedberg -

  
I have an itch on my knee.

  
Matt Willig, the really tall guy from "We're the Millers", a few other movies, and the TV "Dexter" is my height - but looks like this:

  
[![](assets/177-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McyT0HpEoAA/U522PmS-%5FhI/AAAAAAABYN8/tE43AEzkkDI/s1600/%23177+-+Matt+Willig.jpg)

  
I thought "dang, he's my height, but still manages to look more 'big' than 'tall', I wonder how much he weighs... maybe there's hope for me yet!" He weighs 316 lbs. He weighs 94 lbs more than me... Plus he can grow that sweet beard. Life isn't always fair.  
  
That's the kind of stuff the Column is supposed to be about - you know, useless junk.

  
Back on that Matt Willig thing, he has to eat \~700 more calories than me per day to maintain his weight. I eat 2635 calories/day on average. I'm just not capable of eating more than 3000 over any extended period of time. I'm going to go make a protein smoothie.  
  
And now for something completely unrelated.  
  
Two posts ago I wrote about my medium-term goals, including my intention to create a home media server utilizing Plex and Linux. I'm proud to say that's already fully operational. I pulled my old (Linux) laptop out of the closet, installed Plex on it, and had a movie streaming to my television within a couple of hours. The combined library will be resident on that laptop for now; but it will very quickly kill the 300GB storage limit of that piece of hardware. I'm going to have to put some money towards this project at some point.  
  
So, that's cool.  
  
Here's a picture to balance out the huge scary shirtless guy from above:

THOR: THE DARK WORLD and his mighty hammer MJÖLNIR!  
  
I don't think I've mentioned this on the Column yet, but Melissa and I got a new brother for Loki (as seen in the picture above). You can't have a Loki without a Thor.  
  
Idea for a halloween costume: Dress as yourself, then say you are mystique from the X-men disguised as you.  
  
That'll do, pig. That'll do.  
  
Top 5: Things I'm Planning on Doing Tomorrow

5\. Making hamburgers. I never eat hamburgers anymore, so this is a big deal  
4\. Going to work for 9 hours! Yeah!  
3\. Taking some really sweet GoPro footage  
2\. Giving Melissa her birthday present a few days early  
1\. Taking Melissa paintballing for her first time (Josh is coming too, we are going to rock it)

Motto: I wish they played basketball in the NBA

  
I've kind of decided the whole "Wednesday Sunday" update thing will be more like a guideline than a rule. I'll try to do two a week. Because this is Wednesdays post - I guess that means I have to write one tomorrow too?

  
Wednesday I couldn't write because I went to Wichita to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder play the Chicago Bulls. I've never watched an NBA game in person, so I made sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Generally, I don't like the NBA. You don't see the passion and you don't see the teamwork that I'm used to watching in college ball. I hoped that it would be different if I watched it in person - maybe it was just the magic of television making the players look like they didn't care. It wasn't. They don't look like they care about basketball. The only time I really saw anyone show any real semblance of passion was when they had a chance to make themselves look good.   
  
That's my problem with the NBA. Unchecked egos ruin the game. It's never "The Thunder vs. the Bulls", it's "Kevin Durant and the Thunder vs. Derrick Rose and the Bulls". Basketball is supposed to be a team sport. You ruined it.

Apple announced new hardware. The next Macbook, Mac Pro, iPad, and iPad mini were all put out and I don't have much to say about any of them, but I _DO_ have one thing to say about something else from their announcement... They are now officially giving away all of their non-pro software for free. Upgrades to their OS are free. Their office/productivity suite "iWork" is free. Their multimedia suite "iLife" is free. Apple is now giving away their software to draw people into buying their hardware. I _love_ this move. This is a direction I'm very glad to see Apple going in and I'm interested to see how this changes the landscape of the technological ecosystem.  
  
I want to clear up a common misconception about me - I'm _not_ anti-Apple. I'm Pro-Google, Apple-curious, and anti-Microsoft.   
  
Oh - One thing I guess I DO have to say about the new iPad Mini. It is a massive upgrade over the original iPad Mini. It is no longer put to shame by Google's Nexus 7 devices. They are very equally matched in this generation. The iPad Mini is almost double the price, but hey. You should expect that at this point.

Motto: OH BOO HOO  
  
You ever fall out of your groove? It's funny how doing one little thing can start a domino effect.   
  
I didn't feel like cooking, so we ate out for dinner.  
Because we ate out, I don't have leftovers.  
Because I don't have leftovers, I have to buy my lunch.  
Because I have to buy my lunch, I don't get home as early as I would like to.  
Because I don't get home as early as I would like to, I don't have time to make dinner.  
Because I didn't make dinner, I don't have leftovers...  
  
...or another real-world loop...  
  
Because I haven't worked out, I've gotten lethargic.  
Because I've gotten lethargic, I haven't wanted to clean.  
Because I haven't wanted to clean, the place is dirty.  
Because the place is dirty, I misplaced my keys.  
Because I misplaced my keys, I waste 20 minutes looking for them.  
Because I wasted 20 minutes, I leave during the morning rush.  
Because I leave during the morning rush, my commute takes an extra 10 minutes.  
Because I wasted 20 minutes and took an extra 10 going in, I have to stay at work later, but I also didn't bring my lunch and really I probably should stop for breakfast... so suddenly time at home where I'm not doing chores becomes nonexistent, so I don't have time to work out...  
  
It seems like you have to just really be diligent about nipping disturbances in the bud. Or else give up... but that's not really an option.  
  
I know I'm not the only person in the world to have this sort of problem or think about this sort of thing. This is why I'm such an advocate for routine. Routine, to me, isn't "just pick a thing and do that every day for forever", it's "try out a bunch of stuff, pick what works best. Then do that stuff over and over again while you try out other new stuff." If you've got a good morning routine, you can try mixing up your nighttime one. If you've got a good nighttime one, you can try a new morning one.  
  
If you've got a kid, you can basically just hold on tightly as the mechanical bull whips you around.  
  
All that's been the case. Plus we, as a family, have all been sick! This gif comes to mind:

I don't want to claim a premature victory, but I think I may have actually been successful with my \~51st attempt (estimated) to stop picking my cuticles. January's 30 day challenge was to finally leave them alone, and I'm shocked to say I've been very successful. I think Melissa is much to thank for this. She forced me to use cuticle cream and it changed everything.  
  
Top 5: Aaron's Favorite Videogames of ALL TIIIIIME  
5\. Super Smash Bros Ultimate - this is somewhat of a stand-in for every other Super Smash game, which fine cause this is the best one.  
4\. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - this is somewhat of a stand-in for every other Legend of Zelda Game, which is fine cause it's the best one.  
3\. Battlefield 3 - I struggled between this and BF4\. I think I put more raw hours into BF3 back in the day. There was a whole week after I graduated college and before I got my first job that I sank into Battlefield 3, exercise, and learning the basics of cooking.  
2\. Super Mario World - A classic that I never thought anything would ever surpass  
1\. Hollow Knight - I don't know why but this game speaks to me on every level.

Motto: \#hashtag

  
I write these posts according to my own (previously) unwritten rulebook. Today I am going to define those rules in the Top 5\. I bring the rules up because I just wrote the majority of a post that broke several of them. What you see below is what remains of that post (seriously, between here and the Top 5 is what remains after I hit "backspace" a whole bunch).   
  
In the past 20 days, I've written only 2 Columns. That's below par, but not in a good way. I'm not going to apologize for not writing more. I just wanted to say that it's ridiculously clear to me now that how things are going at work & in my personal life directly affect the Column.  
  
I've had a difficult few weeks. I haven't had the "me" time that I need to write these things. It's late and I should be in bed.

  
Top 5: Previously Unwritten Rules of The Column

5\. Be entertaining. If it's not worth reading it's not worth posting. Note this doesn't mean "be funny 24/7".  
4\. Your audience is potentially anyone. When you are writing something, try to imagine the _worst person in the world_ that could possibly read it. If nobody comes to mind, then you're probably okay posting it. If you can think of _anyone_ for _any reason_, even if they aren't likely to ever see it, you're better off without it.  
3\. Keep private things private. This includes writing about your relationship. Relationships are private. The internet is not.  
2\. Include a Motto, Top 5, Quote, and a picture of some sort. That's bread and butter.  
1\. Complaining should be rare. Compliments should be frequent. Commentary is... well... it just is. I just wanted three long "C" words to finish out this rule set. Three sounded better than two.  
  
Regarding #2 from above:

I took that pano earlier today - so I can't complain too much.

Motto: 2017 is 99% complete & I'm 100% ready for 2018 to start.  
  
Christmas has come and gone. Gifts were given. I gave Melissa a back & neck massage thing from Costco that we nicknamed Jerry. I do recommend getting yourself a Jerry. It was a hit. Melissa got me ARMS for the Nintendo Switch, which is surprisingly fun!  
  
Melissa and I are the best gift-givers.   
  
Also the best gift-receivers. Go ahead and test us. Buy us stuff!  
  
Anyway - my dad continued his new tradition of having the kids do a scavenger hunt to find their presents. The grandkids had to follow a trail of drawings on sticky notes. Each one stuck to the thing that the previous one was a drawing of.

The big kids had to solve a Breakout-Room-like set of puzzles to tell them where their next clues were. We got through all the hard stuff in relatively short order, then got stuck looking for something bigger than a baseball, but smaller than a football, within 6 feet of the base of the Christmas tree. Turned out it was through the floor, through a wall, in a coffee can labeled "Used bulbs".   
  
A container labeled "Used bulbs" made total sense to me. I just thought dad was really good at [5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S%5F%28methodology%29). My dad is the best.

...which, naturally, contained escape room tickets.  
  
**Brief aside about this sentence I'm writing right now!**  
  
My favorite form of segue is the kind where you just yell the name of the next thing you're going to talk about.  
  
**2017 Resolutions!**  
  
In 2017, my New Year's Resolutions fell under three categories:  
  
1\. Control  
2\. Comfort  
3\. Captain America  
  
Under those categories I broke down 9 individual goals. These were written on a sticky note that's been on my vehicles dashboard ever since then.  
  
For the most part, I kinda sucked.  
  
Control - intentionally more of it  
Control faltered in and out just as much as it normally does. The goal was present, but the effort was not. Those times where I DID feel "in control", I felt fantastic. I guess I should give myself some credit that for me "out of control" just means "didn't consciously use my time for productive means" - and _not_ something like "got blackout drunk and stole something". My life has never been that far out of my control.  
  
Comfort - intentionally less of it  
Comfort won out over Control. Because I failed to control my use of energy and time, I didn't get out of my comfort zone all that much. I DID try going to some new places. I DID learn how to cook all sorts of new things. I DID make meager progress on the Android development courses I have been taking. I DID NOT do anything that out of the ordinary. I did NOT be much of a Yes Man (although I did re-read that book).  
  
Captain America - be more like him  
This goal was in there mostly as a joke to myself. It was just a reminder to try to do the right things. There were some instances in traffic where people did stupid things, and I found myself reacting with the usual minor flare up of road rage - but saw my note about being more like Steve Rogers and I calmed down. So I guess that's a "win".  
  
**2018 Resolutions!**  
1440x2560\. HA! ORIGINAL JOKE NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER THOUGHT OF!  
  
Rent seeking behavior, a concept I wasn't even aware of until recently, perfectly describes the philosophy I wanted to write about with this Column. I define "rent seeking" as a type of behavior in which the only desire is to maintain status quo. It's associated with a complete lack of drive to be more or do more. It's you wanting someone to pay your rent, so you can just veg out in your apartment and watch Netflix on your parent's account without being hassled to do anything else.  
  
In business - an example of rent seeking behavior is when companies to tear down your opponent's market share through legal means. Thanks to the repeal of Net Neutrality, cable & telecommunications companies are wide open to engage in rent seeking behavior. Rather than create a video streaming service with a compelling library of content, delightful user experience, and competitive price, they can just strangle Netflix's bandwidth.  
  
So I want my 2018 Resolution to fit somewhere in the theme of no rent seeking behavior... but that doesn't really a good SMART goal make. It's MRT at best.   
  
Maybe the resolution should be "[no zero days](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948)". As of right now, that's what I'm going to go with. I'm going to create a list of goals & dreams, and ensure that I'm taking at least one measurable step each day towards at least one of the things on that list, every day... and I'll write down what it was. In a spreadsheet. Cause I'm Aaron and that's what Aaron does.  
  
Top 5: Immediate Additions to the List of Goals and Dreams for My "No Zero Days" Resolution  
5\. Get more in shape. Reach my "fitness" metric goals. This goes without saying, but I've gone and said it.  
4\. Get a Master's degree _(so I can say I'm more educated than my sister and Nick)._  
3\. Make my garage into a workshop.  
2\. Writing a "Life Tracker"-style Android App to replace the Google Sheets one.  
1\. Further develop this list... probably offline. Then make a new sticky note for my car.

Motto: GET ON MY LEVEL  
  
The initial reviews for the Nexus 6P are coming back. I'm buying into the **#HYPE**. [Initial](http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/10/featured-review-google-nexus-6p-2015.html). [Reviews](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review-this-is-the-android-device-that-youve-been-waiting-for/#.c3ufe2:6X7g). [Are](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p-review-the-true-flagships-of-the-android-ecosystem/). [All](http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review/). [Positive](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review-preview-so-far-its-everything-id-hoped/). [Seriously](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review). I am excited for this phone in a way I haven't been since the Galaxy Nexus four years ago... it looks to be a phenomenal showing for Android - a true flagship to stand opposite the iPhone. My Nexus 6P and my wife's iPhone 6S Plus are a perfectly matched duo - I like that. It's a nice symmetry for the life of our tech.  
  
Speaking of **#HYPE**:  
  
  
I'm not the world's biggest Star Wars fan. Not that I'm not a fan - I actually quite like Star Wars... it's just that I've only ever seen the original trilogy once for certain - and that was about a month ago. I'd seen parts and pieces of it in the past, but I hadn't "officially" watched them all the way through, in order. Thus I cannot properly say that I have the same level of **#HYPE** as other, better fans... but I'm still quite excited.   
  
I CAN say that I am ~~probably~~ the biggest Marvel Cinematic Universe fan that I know. When Age of Ultron came out on bluray I started a massive re-watch of the series. Thank you to my wife, who's put up with me watching Marvel movies every other night for the past couple weeks. I'll complete the re-watch probably by week's end. Then I'll pick up Ant-Man for the holidays, re-watch it by itself... then bunker up and wait for Captain America: Civil War in May. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the **#HYPE**.  
  
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. tonight. **#HYPE**.  
  
I'm excited about work things, but I make it a policy not to talk about work things online. It's partially why I am not active on LinkedIn. Another reason I'm not active on LinkedIn is because their service spammed my email with dozens of emails a week until I got around to unsubscribing from the feeds they thought should be defaults for some reason. Regardless, **#HYPE**.  
  
Fantasy Football is a wonderful way to socialize. Also, it's a wonderful way to learn about football if you otherwise wouldn't care about the sport... or so I'm told by a friend that applies to who is definitely not me. No hype here. Just a footnote.  
  
Here's the picture to go out on - my father-in-law flying in to see us:

Top 5: Things I'm Less \#HYPEd about  
5\. It's election season... sorta. All I'll hear about for the next however many months is politics.  
4\. If not politics - I'll hear holiday-related music. I look forward to some parts of the holidays, but the constant renditions of "Oh Silent Night" grow tiresome.  
3\. Winter is coming. It's gunna be cold out again.  
2\. It's flu season.  
1\. I'm writing this at the DMV. I took a day of vacation to come sit in a chair at the DMV. At least they have table for my Chromebook.

# Motto: CANDY SOVEREIGN TERRITORY

Two days ago the words "KitKat" and "Dominion" conjured up no real response in my brain. In the past 48 hours, KitKat and Dominion have SKYROCKETED in importance in my life. 

Android has been named in alphabetical order after deserts since the debut of 3rd generation of Android, which was named"Cupcake". This is what followed:

1. Cupcake (1.5)
2. Donut (1.6)
3. Eclair (2.0-2.1, my first Android phone ran this, I've used every OS since)
4. Froyo (2.2
5. Gingerbread (2.3)
6. Honeycomb (3.0-3.2)
7. Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0, the moment Android quality surpassed iOS)
8. Jelly Bean (4.1-4.3)

Out of the blue Google announced Android 4.4 was going to be named "**KitKat**". Nobody was predicting an announcement and nobody predicted the name was going to be "KitKat" - the rumors pointed to "Key Lime Pie" (which sucks).

KitKat and Google worked this deal out last year. No money was exchanged either way in the deal - and that's awesome. The people at KitKat had enough warning to create this great video:

{% include video id="OKOrkLxOBoY" provider="youtube" %}

In other news, I recently learned to play the board game "**Dominion**" thanks to my good friend Danielle. It quickly superseded all other board games to become my favorite. I liked it so much that I downloaded an Android app that let you play against computers. I played so much in such a short amount of time, I knew I had to delete the app or I would start to hate the game for sucking up so much of my life.

So I just bought a physical copy of the game. Who wants to play?

Motto: BACK ON TRACK  
  
The majority of this Column is going to consist of me doing something I rarely do - criticizing a portion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The following will contain spoilers for the season (/likely _series_)finale of Marvel's Agent Carter. If you don't want to be spoiled, skip down until after the picture of Agent Carter.  
  
I love Agent Carter as a character. I really enjoy Hayley Atwell's performance in the role. I love Jarvis and, in particular, the acting job of James D'Arcy who plays him. I like the period. I like that the protagonist is female (as are many of the antagonists). I really like the idea that Marvel would tell the tell of Agent Carter and Howard Stark in their formulation of S.H.I.E.L.D.  
  
There's just one problem with that last bit, though. It doesn't.  
  
When I first heard about Agent Carter, I got super excited by the premise of the show. There is a great Marvel One-Shot about Agent Carter that tells a story about her being a one-woman wrecking ball, kicking butt, saving the day, and her role as a co-founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark. I was looking forward to a great, self-contained mini-series that expanded on that story. In the middle of the first season, though, I realized that the show wasn't leading into the One-Shot. Near the end of the first season I realized that there wasn't going to be a tie-in to S.H.I.E.L.D. at _all_. I was sad, but happy to forgive the writers because the show was genuinely pretty good.   
  
When the series got picked up for a second season, I thought that _maybe_ this time around my hopes would come to fruition; and this seemed pretty likely in the first episode when the antagonist is revealed to belong to a secret group with a familiar-looking symbol. However, as the season progressed it became painfully clear that not only was I going to have my hopes let down _again_, but also I was going to witness the character of Peggy Carter be pretty well wrecked by terrible writing.   
  
Peggy Carter very quickly finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. Much like with Black Widow in Age of Ultron, Marvel took an awesome female character and turned her into the object of affection whose story revolves around her relationship with men. Can we not have a female character who doesn't eventually become a cute little girl with a crush? Even worse - the two men she makes out with throughout the season are BOTH not the guy she eventually winds up marrying. We know this because of the following quote from Captain America: the Winter Soldier:  
  
"Steve, Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over 1,000 men, **including the man who would become my husband**, as it turns out."  
\- Peggy Carter-   
  
So, obviously she doesn't end up with Sousa or Wilkes. This kills any real dramatic tension for those of use who paid enough attention to know that already. I was **hoping** she wouldn't end up with them because one or both of them would meet a tragic demise this season. However, despite several situations in which one or the other of them clearly _should_ have died, some Deus Ex Machina saved their lives, they walked out of the season alive and well, and Agent Carter never had to deal with any real consequences. This season ends with Peggy on the lap of a man she most certainly does **not** end up with.  
  
Aside from the problems I have with what the writers did to Peggy Carter - let's look at some of the details of the second season:  
  
* The mystery that is brought up in the first episode is never resolved.
* The Zero Matter literally explodes Wilkes, which somehow not only leaves him unharmed but also magically cures him.
* Carter is impaled in the middle of season, but fighting people two episodes later.
* The fate of Dottie Underwood (whose character I do like) was left open-ended.
* The big bad of the season is defeated by her absent-mindedly walking in front of a humongous cannon.
* Nobody of real importance died until the very last minute of the last episode, and even then it was a side character whose death was an obvious attempt at a setup for season 3 (which isn't likely to happen).
* The entire story, while not necessarily _actively disagreeing_ with the established MCU canon, certainly does not want to line up with it.
  
In summary, the television show that is "Agent Carter" failed to deliver on the premise off which it should obviously have been based, fell into the "girl with a crush" trope, and generally sucked in season two.

That was a lot longer than I expected it to be.  
  
The other thing I wanted to talk about in this post is a somewhat new found appreciation I have for history (or, at least, specific parts of history). I went to Wikipedia the other day and started reading about WWII. Within ten minutes my browser had over a dozen Wikipedia tabs open for me to read when I was finished. I wanted to know more about what exactly happened and _why_. All in all, I probably read for 2+ hours about WWII and, to a lesser extent, the Cold War.  
  
What I did _not_ read about was World War I. I don't know much about it, but it seems like it couldn't possibly be as interesting. World War II had Hitler, the Holocaust, the Russians and the United States teamed up, the Manhattan Project, and two nuclear explosions.   
  
I should probably read about WWI before I go out on a limb and declare WWII the "more interesting" one - but I was surprised at how much I appreciated learning about history. That has literally never happened before.

# Site News

I've been doing a lot of under-the-hood work on this website lately. Learning how to push the buttons and twist the knobs just right. I finally feel some actual *control* over how to make things go. For more on that - see the Top 5.

# Consumer Technology Products & Use Case Matrix

Picking up on a concept I [wrote about several years back](https://aarongilly.com/199), I wanted to come up with a list of all the things I'd consider doing on a computer or computer-like device, and map those back to how well they are handled by the various devices available today.

![[392-1.jpg]]

Looking at that, what sticks out to me is that the traditional computer is **still** the best option for the **most** things. But, if you're looking for one device that does literally everything, the iPad has become a very solid contendor. 

Really, the "ultimate device" is probably *technically* a Surface. You get access to desktop software, the portability, and you cover the drawing use case. I suspect, though, that the user experience with a Surface is just... lacking. I've never owned one, though. People who do own them seem to like them. I'm sure I'm wrong. But it feels like desktop crammed into the form factor of a tablet - and the UI and general Operating System were only lightly tweaked with that experience in mind. 

## What's Changed in 6 Years

In 2014, in post #199 (referenced & linked above), I included a few other categories: ultrabooks, "phablets", MP3 Players, E-Readers, small tablets, wearables, game consoles, and streaming boxes. 

It's funny how some of these things have completely gone the way of the Dodo (MP3 Players and the entire concept of the "Phablet" as being distinct from the phone), and some of these things have changed almost none (the Chromecast is the exact same, the top-of-the-line gaming consoles then are still currently the top-of-the-line consoles).

# Other News

Both family cats have now decided they want to be lap cats. This has caused much drama between them. The bigger one didn't used to be interested. Now he is. It's frustrating because he sucks at being a lap cat. I wrote this as he pushed his head against the keyboard.

Motto: I just now learned Timbuktu is a _real_ place

  
August 1st, 2014: I turn 25, my second second-a-day video will be complete, and, even more importantly, the Guardians of the Galaxy are coming.

  
_Is_ coming?

  
_That question just lead me to a solid 15 minute Wikipedia session on clauses - even though the question I posed wasn't really a matter of clauses... I don't think._

  
Back on track -

  
_Guardians of the Galaxy_ is the next chapter in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It falls between _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ (April 4th) and _The Avengers: Age of Ultron_ (May 1st, 2015). _Guardians_ has the distinction of being the only movie from Phase 2 _not_ to be based around a franchise hero established previously during Phase 1\. Some might consider that a risky move by Marvel; but it's a very necessary move if they want to keep making movies much into the future. There can only be so man Iron Man movies.

  
As if it weren't risky enough to be making a movie _not_ based around an already well-established superhero, Marvel chose to move forward with a team of heroes that almost nobody had ever heard of: The Guardians of the Galaxy. A team that features a genetically modified raccoon, a tree-like humanoid, a green lady assassin, a guy who looks like Kratos from God of War, and a guy named "Star Lord".   
  
Cast looks fantastic, track record for these movies is stellar, and this is its trailer:
  
  
This is what I felt like watching that trailer:

Top 5: Steps to Rid My Life of Microsoft Windows

1\. Purchase first new Chromebook that doesn't require some major compromise  
2\. Install Ubuntu 14.04 on said Chromebook (using Crouton) and my main computer  
3\. Find a Linux-based video editing solution  
4\. August's 30 Day Challenge: Don't use Microsoft products  
5\. Eventually realize that you're using Linux not because you have to, not because a covenant tells you to, but because you know in your heart that you want to

Motto: It's What You Make of It

  
Melissa is in Wichita this week. That means I am going to have a manly week. I'm going to fill my manly week with manly things: Weightlifting Eating chicken Watching basketball Eating beef Working hard at work Drinking water Sleeping like a log Eating vegetables Playing basketball Drinking milk Seeing bros Watching dumb videos on YouTube That's the summary of my week to come. I went to the store and had a repeat of the most satisfying grocery run I've ever had: 45% meats, eggs, and milk. 45% fruits and vegetables, 10% other garbage. That garbage was a can of Mt. Dew Kickstart, the new Limeade one. Also, I got some beef Jerky... but that's not bad. It's delicious.

  
I'm going to take advantage of a man week.

  
I started by playing some manly basketball... and by manly basketball, I mean manly volleyball.  
  
MAN STUFF.  
  
Man stuff includes low-brow humor. I'm going to watch South Park and leave this Column off with an example of other such humor:

It's December by the time I'm publishing this.  The title is no longer accurate. Word #1 of this page was a lie. How does that feel for a good start?

A **lot** has changed for me in the past 6 months. I don't even mean the obvious things like "my kid can walk" and "I switched roles at work", although both of those things *(and many others)* are true. The things I'm thinking about are more goal & systems-focused. I've made a lot of changes to what things I do, and the way I do them.

There is another implication of this - I fixed the difficulties I was facing in writing posts. So, more frequent, less gargantuan posts are incoming.

## Morning Me Time
For the past 3 weeks I've been waking up at 5am and walking down to my home gym. That's all I'm committed to doing. The alarm goes off at 5. I go downstairs. I touch my phone to an NFC tag in the gym. It gives me a little pop-up asking if I'm going to exercise, work on a project, or go back to sleep. Whichever answer I choose will be logged to my Life Tracker and texted to my wife. I'm not *anti* getting back in bed... in fact most mornings as I"m walking down the stairs I have every intention to press the "going back to sleep" button... but by the time I make the choice, I'm usually awake enough to make the right one.

This routine change has been **stellar**. I have exercised up to my goal quota for the week. I have made actual *progress* in my drive to learn computer sciencey-crap. I've written more (including this). I drive to work with a sense of clarity that I was desperately missing.

I should thank [James Clear](http://www.jamesclear.com) and his book *Atomic Habits*, which I reviewed [in my previous Column](https://aarongilly.com/381). To make this wake-up-early routine work, I'm employing roughly 6 or 7 different habit-building techniques all at once.   
1. Committing to a 2 minute habit I can keep instead of a longer one I'll fail to maintain
2. Tailoring the environment to remove bad cues (get me away from my bed) and surface good ones (go near my squat rack)
3. Habit stacking: alarm means go to the gym
4. Habit tracking with the Life Tracker integration
5. Social reinforcement with the text message
6. Automation of the two things above
7. Bonus automation for the decision to set the repeating alarm

## Workout Routine
I've spent the past 4 or 5 years exercising by almost exclusively lifting weights and playing the odd sport every now and again. I almost never did yoga. I never did steady state cardio. I never did HIIT outside of basketball season. In September I realized the imbalance in my fitness regiment. I developed [(and wrote about)](https://aarongilly.com/379) a generalized fitness test. I put a recurring task in my Todoist to do a new workout routine every 8 weeks. The past 8 weeks I've been doing P90X3. I am going to continue this new focus on a more well-rounded routine going forward.

## Aaron Information Management
The section header here is a throwback to [this post I wrote in May](https://aarongilly.com/370), it's not the common phrase I think about. BUT! Yeah most things I put in that Column were obsoleted by Notion and Todoist. I'm using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/aarongilly_wgfwvu) for my Getting Things Done system. The best part is, Melissa is using it too. We have a joint task management system & integrated calendars. We both have our own sections, and then we both have access to the family ones. It's genuinely made us six to ten times more "on top of things".  [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=a43b7d84790844c09b86d7b078089923) is a harder product to describe. It's everything you make of it. It's a project management/notetaking/record keeping/wiki creation/databasing super product. I'm using it for project management and my Gillespedia drafting.

Both of those links are referral codes, by the way. I assume I'm under some legal obligation to mention that? I don't know.

## The Column
It looks different because it *is* different. I like it better now. It will continue to grow & evolve. I've finally got a system set up to update it from both my computers with relative ease. So expect good* things.

*Relatively speaking

## The Life Tracker
My long-running project "The Life Tracker" has seen its most meaningful change since 4/22/2018 (the day it turned 5 years old). It now has a "realtime" component. It was an obvious addition, but sometimes obvious things are only obvious after the fact. I still do a "main" tracking routine each night via filling out a Google Form, but now I can make little addendums throughout the day... or have them made for me via automation. 

Oh and I'm using my morning "me" time to actively investigate building it into a legitimate webapp that I could potentially use as a secondary source of income. Neat-o gang.

## Gillespedia
Is a real thing. In May I wrote about the idea. Now I actually have 20+ articles finished on there... with ideas for many more. It is a bit tedious to go to right now. Website hosting on publicly-accessible Notion pages isn't really what that platform was meant to do. Soon I'll transition it to something closer to the Column here, or any wiki page you've seen.

## My Computer
As of yesterday, my desktop PC went from being a cluttered mess on which I performed only a few tasks, to a cleanly-focused machine on which I regularly do all the things I care to do. I've spent the past ~4 months thinking "man I really need to replace this computer and my Chromebook with a Mac or something" because I was unable to write code, write Columns, and publish my work to GitHub (a habit I want to *git* into).

# Other good news
My family and I are healthy and happy living in a good house with financial stability. You know, the little things.

# Top 5: "Next Steps"
1. Get better at putting pictures in these posts.
2. Finish the curriculum of [freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
3. Migrate Gillespedia to something more legitimate.
4. Create a webapp, probably using AWS tutorials.
5. Pick a bigger and better habit.

Motto: Is the "Of Pisa" really necessary?  
  
Stuff's happening. I'm very likely buying a house. Melissa and I will quickly become homeowners. LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. I'm going to celebrate by hanging an American flag outside the place. Also, the Captain America shield in the garage. Anyway, I've been thinking about it basically nonstop. We'll know for sure if we own the house if/when all the stuff between now and closing happens successfully. We're optimistic.  
  
In other news - for obvious reasons I've been thinking about "settling in for the long-haul". I'd like to make sure that I (continue to) do things right with this. To that end, I am going to start a "lunch" project, where I consider the cost, time, and nutritional return for my lunches Monday through Friday. You can go out for lunch, get lunch from the cafeteria, or bring it in. You can go out to place A or place B. Bring in food 1 or food 2\. What are these combinations doing for my health (both physically and fiscally)? Which lunch options should I avoid? Which should I have more often?  
  
I'd say you should look for more on that at some point in the future.  
  
Today I had an idea - I want to replicate the Weasley clock from the Harry Potter books. For those not familiar, the Weasley family has a clock whose hands don't tell the time, but instead point to the location of each member of the family. I want to use a microcontroller & rotary actuator to create a clock whose hands tell whether or not Melissa and I are "in" or "out", based off wifi connectivity/bluetooth proximity/some sort of IFTTT integration online. It's technically possible, but would be very challenging. I will add it to a list of several "I wish I had time to do this sort of thing" projects I've got.  
  
That "I wish I had time" excuse is crap, by the way. I'm sitting on the couch right now writing this. I could easily be working towards any of the goals on that list... but I'm not.   
  
Anyway, this is a best-effort to-scale representation of the place we are looking to buy. Don't read too much into the names of the rooms. They are named after what the look like right now.

Top 5: "If I had the time for it" projects  
5\. "Color blind" video, where objects of a certain color are just completely invisible to the colorblind person.  
4\. Any number of other small projects (like those lunch thing)  
3\. "The first ever photo bomb" video, where someone photobombs somebody else getting one of those pictures taken that you have to sit still for a minute for.  
2\. Learn music.  
1\. Write a "Life Tracker" on Android.

# Motto: You with Your Long Words and Your Short Difficult Words

The following is a list of words I **like**, but **don't hear much** (and my loose definition of said word, verified by an ~~actual~~ virtual dictionary):

**Forum** - *noun* - a meeting views on a particular issue can be exchanged
People often times meet with a specific agenda in mind, and yet I never hear them refer to the meeting as a forum.

**Gait** - *noun* - manner of walking
This does not mean "swagger". I hate the word "swagger".

**Accost** - *verb* - aggressively address
Mugging without the thievery.

**Dote** - *verb* - show unnecessarily excessive fondness 
I think "dote" sounds old-fashioned to me because it's usually followed by the word "upon".

**Trebuchet** - *noun* - a old throwing machine
Although "trebuchet" is a noun, I like to use it as a verb to refer to specifically to how I throw things.

**Goliath** - *noun* - very large person or thing
I actually love all the words for "large" that rarely get used: "Behemoth", "Colossus", "Gillespie".

**Egregious** - *adverb* - remarkably bad, incredibly outrageous

**Plosive** - *noun* - the stop or pause in exhalation that you must make in order to vocalize certain consonants (such as P or B)
I didn't know what this was until 2 days ago. I included it strictly for the purpose of explaining what it was before it got used in today's Quote.

**Gambit** - *noun* - a clever, tricky, or elaborate plot
I really love this one. It's so rarely used, too.

**Kerfuffle** - *noun* - ado, commotion, the business

**Intermittent** - *adverb* - every so often, marked by periods of "not" 

I'm going to leave the column at that.

No wait, one thing:

I really like Family Guy. I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's low-brow. It's dumb. It's glorious. 

I have a relative that works on the show. She's awesome.

Motto: If Not Now, When?

  
Hey, this looks different!  
  
Yes, I've slightly changed the look & feel of the Column to celebrate my move from aarongilly.blogspot.com to aarongilly.com. The move set me back a whole $12/year. I hope to break even by putting an ad on the page. Hopefully you don't feel too alienated.

  
This new look is not what you'd call "final". I'm still using Blogger to host my page. Although it's a Google product and I love Google products, it's not as flexible/powerful as I'd like it to be... so this whole deal may look different again someday. It will still be aarongilly.com - but it wont' be so... well... like this. Some of the weird blank white spaces I'll actually be able to take care of. I'll be able to do lots of stuff. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the new look.  
  
On Friday, December 18th I am turning 10,000 days old.  
  
I read "The Martian" with Melissa. We both highly suggest reading it. The movie comes out in one month and a few days. Also hopefully in that month - new iPhones and the next Nexuses (Nexii?).  
  
I stayed up until 1am scanning things. I really like our new scanner. I'd put my notes online, but they are atrocious. I don't mean "not good", they are plenty good, it's just everything _around_ the notes that's the atrocity.  
  
**Brief rant about phone trees:**  
  
Phone trees are implemented by businesses to save money. The theory is that it will allow customers to route themselves to the solution on their own, thereby removing the need to pay someone to give it to them. In other instances, the customer is routed directly to the proper person who can help them, thereby eliminating the need to pay the first-line phone answerers.  
  
I have a different theory, though. The _true_ cost savings comes from the lowered call volume. People universally **hate** phone trees. Knowing you'll have to slowly try to navigate your way through a ever more frustrating series of "representative... representative... REP-re-zen-ta-tive... REPRESENTATIVE!!! REPRESENTATIVE RIGHT NOW!!!". Only the customers who _really_ _need_ their problems handled are willing to stick through it. Recently I had to call up my health insurer to get them to stop charging me a $100 fee each month. After over an hour on the phone without reaching a single human being I started calculating when my "break even" point would be. At my standard hourly rate of pay, how many hours before this isn't worth it?  
  
I got it solved, but the fact that I _considered_ letting them charge me a bogus $100 fee each month so I wouldn't have to deal with their phone tree just goes to show how terrible they are. They are sacrificing customer satisfaction and some paying jobs to save money.  
  
Makes me want to take this approach to my solution:

2\. 92 - weeks I have successfully "Life Tracked" (out of 123 weeks total)

Motto: Bill Plates - President of Macrohard

  
My 30 Day Challenge for this month was to remove television and videogames from my life for 6 out of the 7 days of the week. As it turns out, I write most of these posts while watching television. I never really realized that until now. Take out time spent watching The Office and you take out the number of posts I'm likely to turn out during any given period of time. That's okay, though - I've got tons to talk about. The past two weeks were very, very full. I'm going to approach this in sections.

  
**The part you can all skip!**

  
I made this short video of Battlefield "highlights" from January - again, this is _me_ playing, so there's nothing all that great in here.
  
  
**Upcoming Media Releases for Which I am Excited:**

  
March 17 - Modest Mouse's album "Strangers to Ourselves"
  
  
April 10th - Marvel's Netflix series "Daredevil"
  
  
May 1st - Marvel's "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" 
  
  
July 17th - Marvel's "Ant-Man"
  
  
August 28 - the reboot of Hitman with "Hitman: Agent 47"  
  
**Spiderman joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe!**  
  
I officially gave up on this happening a while back. Turns out Sony isn't entirely inept and decided that doing a deal with Marvel was more likely going to result in high profits than continuing to flounder with their own Spiderman silo of movies. The terms of the deal are actually pretty simple. Sony is in control of the "Spiderman" movies, and Marvel is in control of any crossover-type movies. This news is welcomed provided a few things:  
  
1\. Spiderman doesn't "take over" everyone's attention  
  
Spiderman is a superhero. He's a _great_ superhero, but he's just one superhero. The Avengers is about _all_ the superheros. There's a delicate balance. I'm already nervous about this when everything there was available to read was "WILL HE BE IN THE AVENGERS AFTER-CREDITS TEASER?!? OHMAIGODOHMYGAAWD!!"  
  
2\. Sony doesn't continue to screw up the solo Spiderman movies & give Marvel a terrible Spiderman for their official "canon".  
  
Now that Spiderman will be an official part of the MCU, it starts to actually _matter_ what Sony does with Spiderman. Sony all the sudden has the capability to poison the well.  
  
**Timbuk2 Command 2015**  
  
This one is coincidental given the content of my last post in which I wrote about "my perfect bag" being a combination of the 2013 Command Messenger and the 2014 Classic Messenger. That's essentially what this is:

I'm going to give myself a couple of months before I decide this is a legitimate want and not a "OH NEW STUFF"!  
  
**The Next Step**  
Melissa and I were talking about stuff last week. We decided we can't say "I want to stay in Kansas City for the next 4 years". With decision, buying a house becomes much less of a sensible option. Long story short - rather than renew our lease in our current place we decided to upgrade to a new one. We just signed the lease yesterday and we're still preeeetty excited about it. Here's some photos from the new residence!  
  
The gym is actually usable (click on this and blow it

The kitchen is the best representation of how nice the place is overall.

Motto: Cause Nothing Ever Stays "Good Enough"  
  
I left the last post off saying I'd write more about Notion. This is going to be that + me revisiting notetaking platform anxieties, which I've written about a few times before. I'm writing here because it helps me think.  
  
Notion is a new-ish entrant into the market of notetaking software - but it's more than that. Notion is a notetaking app, with task-management-like capabilities, project-management-like capabilities, and it looks beautiful while it does it.  
  
  
Notion feels like what would happen if someone sat down and made a wishlist for everything a piece of software would have to do in order to manage _anything_, then they systematically worked their way down the list building something that checks all the boxes.   

### Features in an _anything_ management app:

1. Support for text, images, links, and other types of content
2. Support for to-do checkboxes
3. Ability to organize notes and tasks and reference materials in any way you choose
4. Ability to run a search against those things
5. Databases allowing notes to be grouped together with a common structure
6. Ability to view a database of notes by due date, priority, assignee, tag, or however else you feel
7. Ability to view database as a table, list, kanban board, or in a calendar
8. Collaborative workspaces, with permissions controls
9. Ability to share pages publicly
10. Ability to link to pages, or even individual pieces of a page
11. Ability to do _anything_ without taking your hands off the keyboard
12. Ability to make things look pretty, without having to do a lot of work to do so

Yeah, Notion does all that.  
  
When deciding things, it's very important to understand ultimate needs & use cases. This falls somewhere between the Concept/Initiation and Definition/Planning phases of Project Management. My primary concern right now is to have:  
  
1. A place to quickly capture thoughts, tasks, or other things I want to process later
2. A means of notifying me or reminding me about something I need to remember utilizing (at least) time-based reminders
3. A place to collaborate with my wife
4. A place to store organized thoughts

Notion is all of those things... except it's not _quite_ quick enough to use as my primary capture mechanism. Also it doesn't play well with Google Calendar. You could get around this by literally utilizing Notion for **everything**, including events (there's no reason you couldn't have a Calendar database & view it as such, and constantly having it open to more quickly capture thoughts and tasks... but it's not quite there yet. They are adding new features and upgrading it at a very impressive pace, though. If you don't believe me, check out their "[What's New](https://www.notion.so/157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c)" page and scroll down to see how many features have been added recently.

  
Now before I go...
  
  
I'm going to take a paragraph here to write about how much I like the app "[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)". I'm not affiliated with them (or any app, for that matter), but they deserve kudos for developing **THE** killer app when it comes to bookmarking something to be read later. Unlike other webclippers you may know (Evernote, Google Keep, Notion, etc) the Pocket web clipper grabs the entire content (test & images) of whatever page you clip, minus ads, and syncs them to be read _offline_ on any of your devices. It allows you to tag, highlight, and make comments on articles within the app. It supports dark mode if you don't want to burn out your retinas. Moreover (and more impressively), it has a "read this to me" feature, which turns any written article (such as the one you're reading right now) into an audiobook-like experience. I've started listening to articles I've clipped during my commute. You can queue up a bunch of articles, just like a podcast player. Also just like a podcast player, you can set the speed at which the synthesized voice will read to you. It's really _really_ cool and worth knowing about... and that's all in the _free_ version. See the Top 5 for a bit more.  
  
Top 5: Perfect Killer Apps for Which I Cannot Fathom Improvements  
5\. Apple's Clock App - most clock apps are perfect. This one is on that list. It does the things you'd expect.   
4\. Google Photos - done. Nailed it.  
3\. Pocket Casts - my Podcast app of choice. Functionally perfect  
2\. LastPass - I've committed. It's fantastic.  
1\. Pocket - see paragraph above.

Motto: Boldly Going Where Chrome has Gone Before

  
[![](assets/136-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v1q6jvYeRsc/UuGi54SgQFI/AAAAAAABHS4/gd56UmoD9-4/s1600/%23136+-+Chromebook.webp)

  
**Chrome**books are specialized laptops that run Google's Chrome OS. For those of you who don't know about Chrome OS, just picture a laptop whose only program is the Chrome internet browser. That's basically Chrome OS. Now, because the operating system is that simple, it works great on inexpensive computers. Also because the operating system is that simple, it is not recommended that a Chromebook be your _only_ computer.

  
Having said that, Chromebooks make _excellent_ supplementary computers. If you are out and about and you don't want to lug around your huge laptop, you probably could get by with a Chromebook. That's their ideal usage case.  
  
Ever since I bought my Nexus 5 phone I haven't used my Nexus 7 tablet nearly as much. While I love the Nexus 7, it isn't capable of doing anything beyond what my Nexus 5 is capable of. The extra 2 inches of screen real-estate just aren't compelling enough for me to justify keeping both devices around. So I sold my Nexus 7\. Managed to get back almost everything I paid for it; and I'm using that to bankroll the purchase of a Chromebook, whose usage case doesn't overlap with my current hardware so heavily.  
  
[![](assets/136-2.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--XsJHcRzfdM/UuG8AiTX7TI/AAAAAAABHVI/glIFBqaFFOw/s1600/IMG%5F20140118%5F192203.jpg)

  
There's a problem, though. There is no Chromebook out right now that suits my needs. You can choose between _either_ excellent performance and battery life (left) _or_ excellent design, screen, and build quality (right). You can't achieve both sets of features with what's currently on the market. So, I'm waiting to buy until something comes along that doesn't require compromise.  

  
[![](assets/136-3.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ga8C3zsSmRw/UuG8pNdSuxI/AAAAAAABHVQ/N3NHb6gKF2c/s1600/%23136+-+Chromecast.jpg)

  
**Chrome**cast, Google's $35 HDMI dongle, is an amazing product. There's seriously no easier way to get Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, HBO, Hulu, etc. on the big screen. If you don't have one, you should definitely look into them. I absolutely cannot wait until Google opens up the Chromecast APIs to developers and we start seeing a flood of cast-capable apps. I'm picturing a whirlwind of lightweight games integrated with the cast. Just an initial idea - a connected Texas Hold 'em game where each player sees their two cards on their phone and the communal cards show up on the TV.

  
[![](assets/136-4.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iwdJsEd2bCI/UuG-wnOsiUI/AAAAAAABHVc/drVsi7hjeWY/s1600/%23136+-+Chrome+Bag.jpg)

**Chrome** bags are a thing. They are a hipster's best friend. They are super expensive, though. They also offer too little organization for smaller items. Chrome's main competitor in this space is Timbuk2\. I have a Timbuk2 bag that I've written about previously in [my column about my EDC](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/07/99-feature-on-tools.html).

  
[![](assets/136-5.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bvh8A5dOTtE/UuHBpvpzqQI/AAAAAAABHWg/fbdyksqnNxc/s1600/IMG%5F20140121%5F220227.jpg)

  
You may notice that there are two bags in that photo. That's because I got a _new_ Timbuk2 bag. I'm going all-in with this one. I sold my old Maxpedition bag and I'm giving my old (blue) Timbuk2 bag to Melissa. 

  
Here's the rundown of the new bag:  
\> It's bigger, which I wanted  
\> It fits my body better  
\> It's slightly more professional looking - so I'm going to eventually use it as my REAL Every Day Carry, taking it to work and using it for play  
\> Better storage options  
\> It's got a waterbottle holder  
\> It's got a briefcase handle  
\> The shoulder strap is completely removable - and doesn't make a big dumb loop on the side of the bag  
  
I'm using THIS bag as my true, EDC. It's great. I've used the experience I have from the other two bags when picking this one and setting it up. It's awesome.  

  
**Chromium** is chemical element #24 on the periodic table. I used to know that. I used to know a lot of things. Some time has passed since college and I'm nervous I'm forgetting useful information. I sat down a long time ago to make a comprehensive review of everything I've learned. I got a small amount of work done a couple years back, but it fell by the wayside. I'm still interested in doing it. I want to use Google Docs, though. I think it will force me to learn how to work with Google Docs as well as I know Microsoft Office. 

  
It's part of my grand plan to move away from Microsoft products. Microsoft sucks.

  
There is not an obvious way to tie what I want to talk about next to the theme of "Chrome" - so bear with me here...  
  
"**Chrome**".  
Anagram: "**Home RC**".  
Short for "**Home** **R**e**c**ording".  
Journaling.  
  
I went through my Moleskine notebook last night. I have had it for just under a year now, I pick it up and jot some ideas from time to time. I'm just about halfway through the book, so I decided to celebrate by looking through everything I've written in it. I appreciate my own sense of humor. See the Top 5.

Motto: My Heartbleed's for You

  
The motto is not grammatically incorrect. I used "Heartbleed" as a possessive noun. Now that we've got that out of the way - welcome to the passwords best practices feature. You're about to hear about computer passwords from me, a non-expert who has done a possibly passable amount of research. **Let me start with the heart:** Heartbleed is a bug in OpenSSL that was recently found and immediately exploited. In a nutshell, it works like this (thanks to Randall Munroe and his site - XKCD): ![Heartbleed Explanation](assets/167-1.png) The information the hacker gets in this exploit is whatever just so happens to be stored in memory after the bugged ping was sent. This could be your username, password, credit card information, security question and response, or, more likely, worthless network gibberish and/or somebody else's personal info. There are two particularly scary things going on here: 1\. You have absolutely know what of knowing if your data was successfully mined by hackers. 2\. Even if you were doing absolutely everything right (security wise) on your end, you could still have your information stolen. The only thing you can do is change your passwords on any and all services that were affected by this bug (who have since patched their servers), especially if you used them during the timeframe between when the exploit was made public and when it was patched on the service you used. That's Heartbleed. It is NOT how your personal information is most likely to get stolen, though.   
**Introduction to Password Security:**  
"Hacking" is a very vague term. There's tons of things that could fall under the umbrella of "hacking". What most people generally think of, though, is somebody breaking into your accounts by tricking the system into thinking they are you by logging in with your password (or having your password reset). This could be done via password guessing, brute-force attacks, malicious software, or through "social engineering". Password guessing is easy. If I had to guess your password, I'd start with "123456", "password", "password1", and several variants of your name or your dog's, significant other's, or kid's names. To protect against this, you shouldn't make your password easy to guess. If that doesn't work, I would move on to some sort of brute force method. I don't know all the logistics behind it (because I've never tried hacking someone's accounts), but I do know that it is more sophisticated than entering "000000", then reloading the page and entering "000001". People who use brute force attacks don't do so on the web interface. In laymen's terms, they download an encrypted portion of the page, then run a sophisticated password guessing program, one that has a list of the top 5 million most used passwords and tries all those, then starts in with the "000001" stuff. There's the possibility for malicious software to do you in. Keyloggers that record literally every keystroke you make. There's way more in the way of malware, but I'm going to mention keyloggers later on. Lastly, there's social engineering. If I wanted to hack your Facebook account, I'd pull up your account and see you posting about your dog Fluffy. I'd try to log into your Facebook account using the password "Fluffy" or "msfluffy" or "I<3fluffy". Maybe I'd go to your security questions (to reset your password), and put in the most generic answers I can think of: "What was the name of your favorite teacher?", well I'm going to guess it's "Jesus". Am I right? Then you're in trouble. If you save your passwords in the browser, I can sit down at your computer and have a few of them saved to my USB drive within a minute. If I get your email, the one you use to log into everything else, then I've got you. All your account are belong to me. So, what can we do? **Top 5: Quick Security Tips**1\. Don't make your passwords easy to guess. 2\. Don't reuse your passwords. 3\. Don't make your security questions easy to guess. 4\. Use 2-factor authentication, where possible. 5\. Use a password manager The first 3 tips from above are obvious. But what is 2-factor authentication? What is a password manager? How do I use those things? I'm going to spend the rest of this post answering those very questions. **Two-Factor Authentication** "Authentication" is a verb. When you log into your Gmail, you put in your email address, then you put in your password. If you put in the correct password, you are "authenticated", that is - the service you are trying to use deems you as an authentic user. You are the person who should have access to this account because you know the password. There are 3 major types of authentication - they are authentication using something you KNOW, something you HAVE, or something you ARE. Something you KNOW - you know the password, you're in. Most internet things operate this way. Something you HAVE - you have the key, so you can open the door. The door example isn't a metaphor, it's a physical manifestation of authentication using something you have. Something you ARE - your fingerprint, iris, face, et cetera. This method is high tech and much cooler sounding and looking than the two above. 2-factor authentication means you are using two of the three categories above to authenticate. You need to know the password AND have the key. You need to know the password AND show us your fingerprint. You need to have your ID badge AND scan your iris. There are some very well-known second factor authentication options - the iPhone 5S will unlock without your pin if use the fingerprint scanner. But that's an "or" situation. Your finger OR the password will work. For security, you need an "and". There are plenty of ways to get an "and" in the digital world. I use Google's 2 Factor authentication for Gmail. In short, when someone tries to log into any Google service from a computer I haven't already whitelisted, Google sends me a text message with a 6 digit code. Basically, my phone becomes a key. If you want access to my accounts, you'll need my password AND my phone. I suggest, at a minimum, enabling two-factor authentication for your Google account. **Password Manager** So, what is a password manager? What does it accomplish? Password tips 1 & 2 are hard to do in conjunction with one-another. Keeping complex passwords and keeping every password unique is astonishingly difficult. Enter the password management software of your choice. A keeper of the keys. An encrypted password-protected database that remembers all your login credentials for you... and might do more than that. Instead of remembering a different and complex password for every service you use, you only have to remember one. It's basically just that simple. But they can be more useful than that. They protect you from brute force attacks and password guessing by generating new, random passwords for you. Could you remember "L30x\_)sS\~l3pqQ.$3x"? You think it's easy to guess? Easy to force open? That's a randomly generated password from my password manager. It's what all my passwords look like, and they are all different. But they can be more useful than that. They protect you from keylogger attacks, because you'll never actually be typing out your new ungodly long passwords. They will be copied and pasted into the webpage, either by automatically or manually. You'll only type your database password, which is only useful if the hacker also has access to your database. But they can be more useful than that. Do you know every site to which you have a membership? Now that Heartbleed has come up, and you should change all your passwords, do you even know what all you have passwords to? Will you have to go through the trouble of memorizing new passwords now? For me, I'll just go down the list, use it to login to all my accounts, use it to generate new passwords, change my passwords, save the new ones in my database, and be right back to exactly where I was before. It's an inconvenience, but much less so than if I weren't using the system. But they can be more useful than that. Every password manager I've found allows you to securely store notes or comments related to each password in the database. Got a password for your insurance account? How about storing your agent's contact information, your policy number, its expiration date, and whatever else you can think of in there. Now, you know that when you accidentally hit that tree that drunkenly ran out in the middle of the road in front of your car, you will have all the information you need readily available. And that's just the stuff I use password managers for, they can do a lot more. **How do I use those things?** Sign into Google. Hover your picture in the top-right corner of the page. Click "account". Click "Security". Under 2-Step Verification, click the link and follow the on-screen instructions. I did the process over a year ago, I don't remember it being at all challenging. From that point on, whenever you sign in to Google from an unknown computer, you will receive a text message with a verification code. If ever ONCE you receive a verification code when you aren't trying to sign in, you'll know this process was worth it (because someone will have tried to hack your system but been stopped by the 2nd step of verification). It is an inconvenience if and only if you are logging into new computer all the time... and if that's the case you really need to take security very seriously. When it comes to password managers, there are several options: LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, Roboform, and many others. I have experience with two of these options, LastPass and KeePass. I highly recommend both. **LastPass:**LastPass is probably the biggest, most popular password management solution. It's an online password manager that falls into the category of "freemium". You can set up and use 80% of its functionality without ever paying a dollar. If you want to use some advanced functionality (most importantly, if you want to use their mobile apps), you'll be paying. The good news is you'll only be paying $1/month. That one dollar buys you into a very robust and well maintained password solution. Your data is stored in LastPass's servers, but it is stored and sent to you in an encrypted state. The decryption is done locally, which means your credentials are never visible to their servers or anyone else without the password. You can also set up 2-factor authentication to open up your password vault. **KeePass:**KeePass is probably the next best, next most popular solution to this problem. It's a completely free, open-source password manager. It's less fancy, has fewer bells and whistles, a little rougher around the edges perhaps, and maintained by who knows who in their spare time... but it is designed to work entirely offline. Your passwords are never sent to anyone's servers. They are never stored in an unencrypted state. You own the database file and are free to do with it what you please... and there's something very fulfilling about that. After reviewing both options heavily for a month, I decided to go with KeePass. I love being able to move the file with all my important personal information around. It's great. I have copies of it stored on my computer, hard drive, two flash drives, and on my phone. Beyond the ability to own the database file, I think I went with KeePass because it offered fewer bells and whistles that I didn't want to use. I'd rather not have something that I want than have something that I don't want. I don't want multiple form-fill identities. I don't want a dedicated area to store my credit cards, I don't want to share a list of my passwords with any other "trusted users". I just want what KeePass gives me... and I'm glad I have it. There's tons more to computer security

Motto: HELLO RANDOM PERSON GOOGLING FOR REVIEWS! I wrote this for you!

  
**Backstory:**

I obsessed about backpacks for a few months. I was in a loop where I researched, made lists, Googled, read reviews, _watched_ reviews, went to stores, then started the process all over again in search of the "perfect" bag to buy. I spent a **lot** of time on Reddit's [/r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/), [/r/backpacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/), and [/r/EDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/). I found the website [Carryology](https://www.carryology.com/) and YouTubers [Chase Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/user/chasereeves) and [Bo Ismono](https://www.youtube.com/user/Youknowthebo). It started (over a year ago, actually) with the [GORUCK](http://www.goruck.com/) GR1 - but a few months back expanded to other GORUCKs, the [Evergoods CPL24](https://evergoods.us/collections/packs/products/civic-panel-loader-24l), the [Tom Bihn Synapse 25](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/backpacks/products/synapse-25?variant=50297911815), [REI's Rucksacks](https://www.rei.com/product/118790/rei-co-op-ruckpack-28-pack), and various other bags that you can [only pre-order from Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?category%5Fid=262&ref=nav%5Fsearch&term=backpack). About two months ago I stumbled across the [Timbuk2 "Never Check Expandable Backpack](https://www.timbuk2.com/products/5620-never-check-expandable-pack?view=v2&utm%5Fexpid=.f3eMMDoVTeinLmor6kV1mg.1&utm%5Freferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timbuk2.com%2F)". Being a long-time Timbuk2 owner and proud writer of _the_ top, most helpful review on Amazon's page for the [Timbuk2 Command Messenger bag](https://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Command-Travel-Friendly-Messenger-Midway/dp/B00S8LPWHE/), finding this bag felt like a sign. The Never Check Expandable Backpack is a fairly new product, from what I can tell. It had literally no reviews on the internet outside of two on Timbuk2's own website - both of which were glowingly positive & neither of which I trusted - and [Timbuk2's 30 second promotional video](https://youtu.be/mTlDZRkrjbQ), which was only partially helpful.

  
Anyway it was on sale, so I picked it up a month ago.

  
Thus begins **my review:**

  
The Timbuk2 Never Check Expandable backpack is simple, but not too simple, well-made, but not crazy-well-made backpack with a _terrible_ name and a good combination of features.

It looks unassuming. Its overall shape is reminiscent of a GORUCK\*, and looks a lot like a Evergoods CPL24\* had a baby with a Timbuk2 Command Messenger bag. It's available in exactly **one** color combination - black with blue interiors. 

  
\*I have never owned either of these nor really had experience with them IRL.

  
Let's start with a lot of **FACTUAL INFORMATION:**

  
Their site says it's 12 x 19.5 x 6 inches. My measurements pretty much agree with that.

  
[![](assets/345-5.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cxC%5FtZ9gt5U/W0rUQWmRMYI/AAAAAAADHps/aPmwTf9zL0gcXUq2vudlZCOL7JyeyOB-ACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221339.jpg)[![](assets/345-6.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOR2ADh6W9g/W0rUQbJJAZI/AAAAAAADHps/MuxqDps8Jx4CZGuUC8zCDk7p2bXp3W4tACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221246.jpg)[![](assets/345-7.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7jv59n1Leqk/W0rUQTFhInI/AAAAAAADHps/imj6FD4ZB5onYCGXBXqRZuMwW4y%5Ft5cyACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221208.jpg)

  
The bag has 5 separate storage areas:

1. Main compartment - the big one
2. The front compartment - the smaller one that's got the hooks helping keep it closed
3. The laptop compartment - between your back and the main compartment
4. The Napoleon pocket - small zippered pocket sitting in front of the front compartment
5. Water bottle holder - expands off to the side

The front, laptop, and Napoleon pockets were all designed to be side-entry. Backpacks of this design meant to be easily accessed while standing. In this case, you take your _left_ arm out of the backpack, swing it under your right shoulder in front of you, hold it with your left hand and use your right to unzip & access the Napoleon, front, or laptop compartments. 

  
[![](assets/345-8.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2eTtQ2UeCRk/W0rSDOPoJkI/AAAAAAADHpQ/1OqpTvnHIS4puIONpkMRaXOMWfqgUnDLACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F234421.jpg)

  
Each of these pockets is done in a way that doesn't make everything in them fall down on top of itself (which was a criticism of the Evergoods CPL24). The front organizer has a four vertically-oriented slip pockets, each running half the width of the bag (they do not extend down past the visible opening) and a zippered pocket running the entire width of the bag (does extend all the way down).

  
[![](assets/345-9.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--Jvl4S0zpP0/W0rHFWJrdzI/AAAAAAADHn4/KIZ1rxPjtMs3K%5FefnPq01QLfqLy7MUTFACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F220835.jpg)

[![](assets/345-10.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x00HkZpRb3M/W0rIP7vevRI/AAAAAAADHoE/QCuKLiMCHqQq3Djx%5FwtYKzah2h9qPH55gCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221558.jpg)

  
The Napoleon pocket does _not_ run the entire length of the face of the bag, but instead sits in the middle third - making it sized slightly bigger than a pocket in your jeans (or, if you wear girl jeans, it's _way_ bigger). 

  
[![](assets/345-11.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xW93nZVmaU0/W0rJAKPBJ-I/AAAAAAADHoM/O3mUPRA83vMyba34WsoXRgNkClGNrPTnwCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F220947.jpg)

  
The laptop compartment near your back is padded, but not suspended. It's also not overly large, in my opinion. I'm writing this on a Samsung Chromebook Plus (which I also highly recommend, by the way), which isn't a big computer. I was able to fit it and a spiral notebook in without much trouble, but carrying my wife's Macbook Air in with them was a pretty snug fit.

  
[![](assets/345-12.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o8yZAcmnVLI/W0rJ9gX-ZzI/AAAAAAADHoY/Qd90Ebp9AzwMTFjWAr-RrJo1VGGWeXQJACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F220642.jpg)

  
The main compartment _would_ be clamshell-style if it weren't for some gusseted pieces of fabric that limit how far open the bag gets. 

  
[![](assets/345-13.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iXsUjvf%5Fhro/W0rKx7UoK%5FI/AAAAAAADHoo/KtKg5FkOYbgXI%5F8cCTda9K%5Fk3y-HrP61QCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221750.jpg)

  
In that main compartment is a thin separator along the back wall (for notebooks or whatever), whereas the front wall houses a zippered mesh pocket on top and smallish, suspended pocket just below that which is about half the width of the bag.

  
[![](assets/345-14.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZllyDHePWe4/W0rLUh88LAI/AAAAAAADHow/CP3JWuhy7LgHjQqSkio%5FjBGgE-jyGwqiQCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221719.jpg)[![](assets/345-15.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ifSYn5UXKwU/W0rLUvIONCI/AAAAAAADHow/pNmh%5FIlrTFAZtSD6UqM7DeSPd%5Fip9NutgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221819.jpg)

  
The main compartment is the only one that's affect by the "expandable" nature of the backpack. The expandability does NOT affect the bottom wall of the bag. Instead it lets the bag go from tapered from top to bottom to being essentially more flat (if not tapered the _other_ direction).

  
[![](assets/345-16.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sTpvrtoBUdo/W0rTaghwzZI/AAAAAAADHpg/LuK0z7Tk4LQs2T2b8MO4NmwTxqA3oiqaACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F234316.jpg)[![](assets/345-17.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-THfQh6l%5FkDk/W0rTavhaZhI/AAAAAAADHpg/NZtiJSbjJysjraujWIygA2i2kO6LgGxCgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F234250.jpg)

  
Lastly, there's the water bottle holder. It zips away and folds flat when not in use. Unzips to an elastic mesh that allows you to comfortably hold a Hydroflask (20/24 oz), or a 20 oz bottle. You _can_ actually force a Nalgene bottle down in there, but it doesn't feel like it was mean to stretch that much.

  
[![](assets/345-18.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5PxaqJrnMwA/W0rSusTs4zI/AAAAAAADHpY/UBBPiHDB0XQpwV-3m2CS6DFAbGZ797ErgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221916.jpg)[![](assets/345-19.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DlEid2cJgOQ/W0rSuixDUjI/AAAAAAADHpY/EbZQ8X7lAugT%5FrWB3ZyvctwjlDPXvonTgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180714%5F221955.jpg)

  
Unlike the CPL24 or any GORUCK, this bag has no morale patches, nor Molle attachment points. There is, however, a few good places for carabiners to attach around the handles on the top and side.

  
For reference, that green notebook you see in a few of those shots is 8 by 6 inches. It's also awesome and no notebook can ever replace it.

Now that we've got the facts out of the way, let's talk about **OPINIONS AND NOTES ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE!**

  
The pragmatically-named Never Check Expandable backpack is not a purchase I regret, but like most other things, it's not perfect. There are a lot of things to like about this bag, and a few design choices that not everyone will like.

  
Thus far I've used it as my sole travel bag for 3 overnight car trips, the longest of which was 3 days. It's also accompanied me to a couple of coffee shops, a farmer's market, and I took to just start storing my laptop and charger in there when I'm around the house. It's functioned very well for all of those tasks. Here's an example loadout (what I took to go to my in-laws for a couple days):

  
[![](assets/345-21.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bQMi4Zgsd9A/W0rkTFDMyzI/AAAAAAADHqY/sHI0sEFf1bkdMdrhSjMTOp8jq6QR9rKkwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20180607%5F223728%2B-%2BEdited.jpg)

  
All that fits in there with plenty of room to spare.

  
[![](assets/345-22.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YD-6cHOpy3k/W0q0GBv6zsI/AAAAAAADHlg/1eOoCwXoHMIbubDNx%5FDTTWHDy%5FajUOh8QCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG%5F20180607%5F223330.jpg)

  
The good stuff:

* I _really_ like the way it looks. It's clean and simple without being overly plain. It really nails the balance I was looking for between being "minimalist" and "fun".
* The bag stands up by itself really consistently without the need for any sort of internal frame. Makes sitting it down and picking it up really easy. Makes it look not out of place when you sit it next to a chair.
* It holds more than any Timbuk2 I've owned thus far - enough to take a 3 day trip with some room to spare. I look forward to my first real "one bag" travel test with it - maybe get an excuse to actually use the expandable feature.
* Again comparing to the (four) Timbuk2 messenger bags I've had experience with, it's by far and away more comfortable to carry for extended periods. I was all about messenger bags for years. I thought they looked great and professional and all sorts of stuff, but really backpacks are more comfortable for carrying anything remotely heavy. Wearing this backpack with only the essentials in it feels like I'd never possibly get tired of wearing it. Also the side entry design actually makes this backpack easier to use while standing than my messengers.
* The handles on the top and side feel good. They're low-profile without being completely flat to the bag. They're usable but manage to blend in. They balance the weight of the bag well and feel good to use.
* The organization works really well with my packing style - or, should I say, I didn't have to change my packing preferences to accommodate the bag.
* The water bottle holder works very well for my 24 oz Hydroflask.
* The blue interior makes finding stuff in the bag easy. Also it gives it a fun and unique look as compared to some of the other bags I was looking at.
* The straps have thumb holds that make them easy to adjust up to tighten the bag to your back. This is more handy than you'd think.
  
The "meh" stuff:

  
* The zippers are good, but not the best zippers I've ever used. They don't get stuck, but don't feel like they're broken in yet. Timbuk2 aired on the side of caution here, as the zippers definitely just won't fall open as you walk around. Also - if you're not careful the zippers on the mesh pocket at the top of the main compartment can also get in the way of the zipper that closes the main compartment.
* The expandable portion of the bag doesn't affect the bottom of the bag. This makes the "expansion" fairly limited. It's not a feature I plan to use - but I like knowing it's there if I need it. Also it tucks away and is very easy to forget about.
* The straps don't feel indestructible. They don't feel bad, either, but it seems like some expense was spared in the selection of the straps and manufacturing their attachment points. They're fine, but probably not as good as most of the other bags I looked at.
* The chest buckle thing (never know what to call those) is fine. It's adjustable to one of four discrete positions. It does the trick, but nothing else.

The bad stuff:

* The water bottle holder is only on one sit of the bag, and it's the side on the bottom if you're getting into any of the three compartments that open from the side. This means your water bottle is prone to fall out if you're standing and getting into the front compartment, and you can't sit the backpack on its side with a bottle in there.
* The hook closures on the front of the bag are _only_ for aesthetics, and get in the way _every_ _single_ _time_ you access the front compartment, which is probably my most-used area of the bag. Before I bought the bag, I thought you could use these to cinch the bag shut like compression straps, but that's not their function. They're there for looks, and looks alone. They do look nice and maintain the Timbuk2 brand, but at the cost of adding a step every single time you get into arguably the most helpful compartment in the bag? That's questionable. I guess you _could_ say they are there as a security feature, but they weren't marketed as such.

  
Like I said. Overall, I like the bag and do not regret my purchase. I think each of the bags listed at the front of this Column comes with its own set of compromises, and the compromises for this bag are ones I'm willing to live with. The Never Check Expandable backpack is a well designed, well made bag with a dumb name. At the end of the day, I'm still a happy Timbuk2 customer.

  
THERE YOU GO INTERNET. NOW YOU HAVE ONE REVIEW.

  
Top 5: Parts of the Timbuk2 Never Check Expandable Backpack that Surprised Me

5\. For some reason I expected it to be a bit bigger than it is. It's as big as they advertised, but I guess I was just picturing those measurements to "feel" a hair bigger when translated to a real-life backpack.  
4\. Despite looking about the same size as my medium-sized Timbuk2 bags, it DOES actually hold significantly more... and is much more comfortable and less "bloated" looking in doing so.  
3\. It stands up by itself. I didn't expect this. Moreover I didn't expect to love and use this feature so much.  
2\. The expandability doesn't go literally all the way around the bag, and thus   
1\. The loop closures do nothing other than look good and get in the way.

Motto: Aaron, Meet Aaron

  
This post is going to be long, but it's kind of a big deal. Hopefully some of you find it interesting. Last week I added the 52nd "weekly summary" into my Life Tracker. That means I've successfully tracked one full year of my life. With that, I've decided to call an end to the Life Tracker and claim victory in accomplishing the longest-running, most intense project I ever took upon myself. For those of you paying keen attention, you'll notice that I didn't start this project last September; I started it last March. I took off a week or two every now and then (including all of July, 2013), so getting 1 year's worth of tracker data actually took 17 months. Although I may not have tracked as consistently as I would have hoped, I managed to keep the project running for a much longer time than I anticipated going in. Along the way, I learned a ton of useful information. The idea came to me when I realized how unstructured and hectic my life was. I was fresh out of college, living on my own in a new city. There were so many variables in the air, so much more room for catastrophic failure. I worried that I'd soon become a fat, broke, introverted loser unless I did something about it. I wrote down my goals and tried to find tool to satisfy them. When I realized no such product existed, I decided I should just **make something**. Melissa suggested I use Google Forms and Google Spreadsheets, I learned Javascript and the Google Apps API, and within a few weeks I was up and running. That's the history of the project. This is what it was like to actually _do_ the tracking: I wake up. I hit snooze. No part of that gets recorded, it's just something that happens. I eat breakfast. I grab my phone, hit a button on the homescreen, Chrome loads the Life Tracker Input form, I hit "Diet", "Next", then type "Che", select "Cheerios Protein (2.5 cups with 1/2 cup 2%)" that pops up, then hit "submit". Now I've successfully tracked breakfast. I go out for lunch at Chipotle. I pay for my lunch, hit a button on the homescreen, wait a second, hit "Money", "Next", then type "$7.43", then "Chipotle", then choose "Other Food" from the categories list. Afterwards I enter the Chipotle burrito bowl into my diet like I did with the cheerios from that morning. For dinner Melissa makes some sort of stir fry in our wok. I see what she puts in it, go to Wolfram|Alpha on my phone, type "1 cup white rice + 7 oz chicken + brocolli + carrots + mushrooms + 3 tbsp soy sauce", then transcribe the resulting nutrition information into the diet section of the Life Tracker using the same method as before, then make the arbitrary decision as to whether the food was "Good" or "Bad" for me, then hit "Submit". I go to the gym and do my squat/bench routine. I hit a button my homescreen, wait a second, hit "Exercise", "Next", then type "Bench/Squat", then choose "Heavy Lower" from the categories list, then "Submit". As I lay down for the night, I hit a button my homescreen, wait a second, then hit "Demetri", "Next", then I answer the following 27 questions:  
What day is this entry for? (combo box for day selection) What did you do today? (paragraph box for review of day's events) The rest of them I just checked off each completed thing - **Body**Worked out - Tracked Drank Water - >2 Liters Ate Well - Tracked Brushed & Flossed Slept 7.5 - 11:30 to 7 **Mind**Wrote a Column Worked on a project - non-Column Learned/practiced something useful Read >20 minutes Stayed intentionally positive **Management**Budgeted spending - tracked Stayed on top of appointments and bills Kept place clean & organized Knew and worked towards goals Used time well - didn't waste it **Work**Took breaks, but didn't waste time Meetings: On time and took notes Took steps to further career Knew all projects statuses & next steps Communicated well & often **Others**Went on a friend date Did something nice for someone Talked with family Took care of relationship Focused less on yourself After I answered all of the above questions, I hit "Submit" and go to bed. Rinse. Repeat. So now you know where the project came from and what it was tracking, **what were the results?** In short, I eat less than I probably should and _definitely_ worse than I should. I manage things well. I treat my friends better than my body and my body better than my mind. I do about as well at work as I do at taking care of my body. The only major failure in this project was the Money tracker. I kept changing my mind on how it should work and reorganizing things. I just never did a good job of tracking all of my monetary transactions. About halfway through the project I gave up on tracking money with the Life Tracker at all. "An average day" In any given day I will eat on average 2685 calories - 101 grams of fat, 298 grams of carbs, and 137 grams of protein. The caloric breakdown of those macros is 34% fats, 44% carbs, and 20% protein. The remaining 2% comes from rounding both errors and alcohol (which yields calories but doesn't fall into any of the above categories). I will most likely NOT exercise in this day. If I do - it will most likely be a heavy upper body workout. I'll spend roughly $51 (this figure doesn't really make much sense, though). I'll accomplish between 2 and 3 of each of my five work, mind and body goals. I'll accomplish between 3 and 4 of my management and "other" (which really should have been named "Social") goals.

I can tell you more beyond "what does an average day in the life of Aaron look like", though. Life is _complex_. Trying to look at trends in something like calorie intake or money spent on a day-by-day basis is like trying to understand white noise. It's amazing to think that everything we manage to get by with such a chaotic mess underlying it all. I made a ton of bar graphs and charts. For those of you who like pictures to represent data, this section is your treasure trove: **Dietary trends over the year:**  

[![](assets/205-2.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lH2Jxfk2tCM/VCTVqOGFToI/AAAAAAABeDk/EYEovYPf2TE/s1600/Calorie%2BIntake%2Bvs.%2BTime.png)

I've grown to eat ever so slightly more calories. I spiked up during my first ever 30 Day Challenge: The October Project.

Over the course of the year, I started to eat more protein, a consistent amount of fats, and slightly fewer carbs. More on the carb thing in a second.  

[![](assets/205-4.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-%5FOJLFTEhO2o/VCTVsfkYAeI/AAAAAAABeEU/qM69FY78fFQ/s1600/Macro%2BRatios%2Bvs.%2BTime.png)

My macro nutrient ratio stayed fairly constant, except when Melissa and I did the 30 Paleo Challenge, where I upped my fat intake and lowered my carb intake. The ratios did NOT change during my "eat as much as you can" month last October. **Dietary trends over the week:**

I eat in a cycle, every other day I eat more... it resets on Mondays. This result amused me.  

[![](assets/205-6.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r3QH8054erc/VCTVr1nvmzI/AAAAAAABeEM/yi6mBK6nhmY/s1600/Macro%2BRatios%2Bby%2BDay%2Bof%2BWeek.png)

My macronutrient ratios don't change much over the course of the week. If anything, I eat slightly less protein on the weekends.  

[![](assets/205-7.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E02-oaW2wxQ/VCTVrYKMl8I/AAAAAAABeEA/wKn71BkwYX8/s1600/Good%2BFood%2Bby%2BDay%2Bof%2BWeek.png)

The percentage of my food that I deem "good for me" follows an oddly consistent wave pattern. This result also amused me. **Demetri trends over the year:**   

[![](assets/205-8.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-83Mst7pqvZs/VCTVq5hypPI/AAAAAAABeD8/sg2bbkWoYQo/s1600/Demetri%2BTotal%2Bvs.%2BTime.png)

  
I became a slightly less productive person throughout the year. This could be do to several things, but it's probably easiest explained as "I'm getting lazy". So I need to stop that.  

[![](assets/205-9.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f4EuK4i1sxc/VCTVq7xZp-I/AAAAAAABeD0/ZGfeL0BXZCw/s1600/Demetri%2BCategory%2BTotal%2Bvs.%2BTime.png)

That chart is ridiculous. What you're seeing is the average totals from each category of the Demetri list. When I added trendlines to it (not shown) I was able to determine that over the course of the year I got slightly better at caring for others and worse at caring for myself.  

[![](assets/205-10.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tEAcc%5FGQYxM/VCTVrCX9EkI/AAAAAAABeD4/TMVPNwF3yew/s1600/Exercise%2BFrequency%2Bvs.%2BTime.png)

I exercise less often (which, when combined with "eat more calories" from above, does not bode well). **Demetri trends over the week:**  

[![](assets/205-11.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0MHCb4zh93s/VCTVqBgPYoI/AAAAAAABeDo/iK%5FIWVFg6H0/s1600/Demetri%2BAverages%2Bby%2BDay%2Bof%2BWeek.png)

The most obvious one of all - on the weekends I see friends more and go to work much much less. Looking at the individual categories, my effectiveness at work over the course of the week looks like a (very flat) bell curve. I manage things best at the beginning and end of the week. I am mentally burnt out on Fridays. Actually, I just don't get much accomplished on Fridays at all.  

[![](assets/205-12.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11lGukd5WZs/VCTVr50p%5FtI/AAAAAAABeEI/TaWb7NbL3a4/s1600/Likelihood%2Bof%2BEvents%2Bby%2BDay%2Bof%2BWeek.png)

I just picked out 4 seemingly interesting Demetri data points and determined how likely I was to do them on any given day of the week. My place is most likely to be clean over the weekends. As with before, my friend dates happen mostly over the weekends. I eat much less clean over the weekends. I sleep the most on towards the middle of the week.  

  
**One final note about exercise:**  

[![](assets/205-13.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g%5FXRXb63A90/VCTVsqPEt0I/AAAAAAABeEc/PxC3w-bXWQc/s1600/Workout%2BType%2BCharts.png)

My workouts break down into two main types, heavy lifting types and non-heavy lifting types. When compared to days without a workout, I eat more when I lift and less when I run or do yoga. When compared to days without a workout, I eat healthier when I lift and even healthier when I run or do yoga. WHEW. That was intense. So. I made the mistake last night, after sorting all this data out, of asking myself "if I knew then what I know now, what would I have done differently?" That's where I came up with the Top 5.

  
Top 5: **Things I'd Do Differently If I were Building the Life Tracker Today** 5\. Actual integration with the 30 Day Challenges project. Make a note each month of the challenge and create a data summary by month. 4\. In terms of organization, I'd keep a single sheet of the workbook for each facet _and_ I would keep the weekly summary view, but I would add in the monthly summary that I just mentioned AND a new main page where I aggregate and summarize data on a day-by-day basis. I had to do that manually yesterday. It took the entire night and it suuuuuuucked. Seems obvious now, but I didn't think of it until yesterday. Correlating across sheets was very difficult without a single, consistent index. 3\. Include more objective data: such as sleep patterns, pedometer stats, heart rate data, weight, and anything else I can get my hands on. It would be interesting to see how amount of sleep correlates to productivity. How weight correlates with exercise and diet. 2\. Also include more subjective data - not Demetri-type goals, but more like a survey. "How are you feeling physically?" "How are you mentally?" "Where you tired throughout the day?" While I'm at it, I'd probably reduce the size of the Demetri list. I'd soften some of the rigid spots and firm up some of the soft spots. Automate pieces that could be automated. 1\. Establish clear money goals & budgets beforehand. I would leave out bills, only include spending on a voluntary basis. If I can choose WHEN I spend it, then I'll include it.

Motto: I'd make another wheel-based pun, but I won't because I'm 3/4ths tired.

  
Over the weekend Melissa and I drove to Nebraska to see our family, learn about the town in which my sister lives, and watch niece get baptized. We drove through St. Joseph, Lincoln, and a few other cities while listening to iTunes Radio Top 50 songs that Aaron wants to never hear again. We took a tour of the new athletic facility at my sister's University (she is assistant volleyball coach). We chilled out in a hotel lobby and ate pizza. We went to church and I made a joke to my wife about the baptismal font being "Helvetica". She said it wasn't my best effort.  
  
It was a good time and we are very glad we went.  
  
The _real_ story happened on the way home, though. To get to home from where we were is a 5 hour trip. Just as we entered hour 4, our driver's side rear tire did this:  
  
  
To put it in a less entertaining way, our tire did this:  
  
  
[![](assets/194-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I7bL6auPuOk/U%5FZ1uuMZEJI/AAAAAAABbpM/aDRpIjrodJ4/s1600/IMG%5F20140817%5F014125.jpg)

  
What transpired next was essentially just an hour and a half of phone calls, waiting, and walking around an off ramp at 2 in the morning. I'd never had to use my AAA membership before, nor had I ever got my car towed.  
  
Why didn't you just change over to your spare tire?  
  
Something something hybrid car blah blah no spare yadda yadda I'm going to get one.  
  
That transpired Friday night (or, technically, very early Sunday morning). What happened all day Sunday was basically the pinnacle of friends and family helping you out when you're in a jam. I was personally chauffeured like Mrs. Daisy by a friend while a spare vehicle was delivered to Kansas City by family. Truth be told, getting so much help when we're in a tight spot makes me a little emotional. I'm not capable of handling such gratefulness. Same thing happened during and after the wedding.  
  
I like being self-sufficient. I take pride in my ability to be prepared for, know how to handle, or generally get out of any bad situation I find myself in... but really none of that compares to having people there for you.

By the way, I took the wheel off and put it back on myself. I'm not sure why that's supposed to be challenging. "Do you know how to change a flat?" If you have a spare, it seems pretty obvious. Maybe I was just raised right.

A motto: Tomato  
  
It has been a while.  
  
Have you ever been too busy living life to live life? I have been seizing the crap out of the day, every day. Since I last wrote, I've gone golfing, different golfing, bowling, bike riding, watching baseball, building a brick walkway, playing volleyball, playing different volleyball, practicing basketball, playing bocce ball, playing lawn games, playing group videogames, playing pool, playing different pool, going shooting, shooting yourself in the face, and watching both movies and show finales with friends. My patented Aaron projects have all fallen by the wayside. They require time and boredom. I've been blessed enough not to have much of either to spare.  
  
About that "shooting yourself in the face" bit. I had a bad ricochet while shooting some steel. It turned out alright:  
  
[![](assets/314-1.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cTp5H32Dk1A/WSycPvFdgmI/AAAAAAACrQo/8SKEpqsplggMF69ig-dWOCE2BeIaSLC2gCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20170513%5F112600.jpg)

  
And now I get to say for the rest of my life I survived getting shot in the face.  
  
More than all of that - I got to eat delicious delicious Chuy's. They are opening up a Chuy's Tex-Mex restaurant 3.8 miles from my house. That's not even "as the crow flies", that's the length of the drive it takes to get from here to there. If you don't know what I'm talking about - Chuy's is Melissa and my mutual favorite place to eat. Our first couple vacation was to Austin, TX almost exactly 5 years ago - we ate at Chuy's 3 times in the 4 days we were there. We also went to IKEA twice.  
  
Now there's a Chuy's 3.8 miles from my house... and an IKEA 13.5 miles. Also I'm married to beautiful girl went on that vacation with. Life has worked out.  
  
Tomorrow I will have tracked 1500 days in the Life Tracker. I'm celebrating by doing nothing new or exciting.  
  
June's 30 Day Challenge - Bullet Journaling. Also I'm going to make a conscious effort to eat more, life more, and be all-around huge.  
  
I had some other stuff to write about. It's all slipping my mind at the moment... and I'm tired. I think I'll go now and try to remember it by dreaming about it.  
  
Here's the picture to go out on:

Motto: 14 million 208 thousand 480 minutes! 14 million 208 thousand 480 moments of rife! 14 million 208 thousand 480 minutes! How do you measure, measure a life?

  
Last week I turned 27\. 

  
Here are some life tips from an old man:

* Buy two waterbottles you really like. Keep them in the fridge. When you finish drinking one, fill it and put it back in the refrigerator. You'll always have cold water on the ready and will wind up drinking more. Or be like me and buy 5 Nalgenes.
* Don't burn bridges. (that advice came to me from the time I set Jeff Bridges on fire)
* Buy a slow cooker or a pressure cooker. Also buy a single-serving style blender. Use them both very often.
* Patience is a virtue... but more often it's just _the only thing you can do_. Get good at it.
* Don't trust the lid.
* It's easier to stay in shape than it is to get in shape. Know your body. If you find more of it than you expect, take care of it before it becomes a problem. [Here's the basics](http://simplesciencefitness.com/#fundamentals).
* Don't stop to smell the roses. Bring the roses with you. Smell them as you go.
* Set goals. Achieve them. Learn from what you've achieved. Set more goals.
* Make references to R.E.N.T. when people don't expect you to.
* Think about the person you want to be. Think about what that person does. Think about how that is that different from what you do. Do those things.
* Learn how to use the tools you have available to you. Develop proficiency.
* Marry the right person, like me... but don't marry the same person I did. She's taken.
* Butter is usually better than margarine. Margarine is a lie.
* Say "Yes" more.
* Try being born handsome.

Now that you've learned everything there is to know, here's all the entertainment there is to enjoy:

# Motto: Float On

This weekend was Nick's bachelor party. 

When I say "bachelor party", what immediately comes to mind?

None of that stuff happened. Which I'm glad for. I'm much more comfortable not doing all that stuff. We went on a 42 mile float trip down the Current river. It was a ton of fun. It was very relaxing. Very not relaxing. Very cold. Very hot. It was a great weekend, and I need to do things like it more often. Both in terms of the content of the trip and the being with people who went on it.

Originally, I was going to compile a highlight video.

Originally. 

Instead I'll submit to you this picture of (almost) everyone who went.

![](assets/98-1.jpg)

We spelunked.

I just now noticed there are between 4 and 5 people giving thumbs up in this picture, even though we couldn't see each other doing it (it was absolutely pitch black in there when we were taking this photo).

I'm going to keep this really short, cause I'm already tired.


Really short.

Top 5: Best Moments from the Float Trip
5. Getting threatened to get our tents peed on by some real interesting folks we passed by. We decided not to camp there.
4. Nick ran our canoe into a tree while trying to reach a football. We subsequently took on water and tipped.
3. The cave was awesome. ~250 yards of narrow passes, climbing, and watery crawling. All resulting in the picture above.
2. Not one "moment" per say, but the collective conversation that took place during the entire course of the trip. There was a large group of good guys that each have unique and interesting lives and viewpoints. This, though, wasn't as sweet as the number one best moment...
1. Nick made fun of me for slipping on a muddy hill. Then Nick stepped on the same hill, also slipped, and essentially did the splits across the front of a canoe.

<cite>Nick sang this at max volume for ~30 minutes while we paddled down the river in the rain. This is basically the only line of the song he knew.</cite>

# Motto: Productivity schmoductivity

Fixation is a state to which I have a natural predisposition. The search for perfection is as close to perfection as you can reasonably get. My phone (my shining beacon of zen) has always been and continues to be my greatest achievement in this pursuit. Over the years, I've spent hours (realistically, days) trying to find the exact balance of functionality with efficiency. Lately, it's been EDC culture. EDC (Every Day Carry) culture is just the appreciation for those items and tools which people from various walks of life carry every day. It probably started in high school with my auto-preparedness kit idea. Basically a bookbag chalk full of everything you might ever need on the road. The notion flared up again a few years back with the desire for a 3-day bag (or Bug-Out Bag). After an diffused amount of fixation over an extended period of time, a small amount of money was spent and I now carry a very basic version of this in my trunk next to the original project. I rarely use either of these items (although it has happened before). After stumbling across this sub-reddit, I became more intentional about the things I put in my pockets. I wanted more capacity. I wanted something that was somewhere between a full-blown bookbag and a man-purse or "murse". 

Long story not-so-short, I found a bag that I think will perfectly fit the bill. I also thought of how and what I'm going to carry in it. The things are in the mail and the venture is closed. 

Strangely, after making a final EDC seletion my productivity streak abruptly stopped. I have no idea why.

On the plus side - I have seen most all of Futurama in the past week and a half. Wait, I think I might now what the problem is...

# Motto: HTML Stands for "Hard To Make Look (Good)"

The column doesn't format well. I've noticed consistently throughout the year that Blogger often introduces its own formatting decisions between the "edit" and "publish" phases of my column writing. This post employs an intentionally new typeface throughout. The headlines are Arial. The body Verdana.  I used to use Droid Sans. It was a very Googly thing to do.  Today I wrote some poetry. I used to write poetry fairly often, but I quit a while back.  I thought I left poetry at the right time.  Was it wrong not to write anymore? I wanted to fill a tall order in short bursts. When I was down with what was up, I differed being different to be similarly similar. Now I think a little bigger. That's a poem. This is a short column. I hope the formatting looks the same after the publish as it does here in the editor. I don't want to do all my columning in raw HTML. If it comes to that, I will do it, though. I hate consistent inconsistency in formatting.

Motto: **Take a jaunt.**

  
This post will contain nothing about Marvel, coding, Life Tracker, second-a-day videos, Google, technology, or me. It will instead be the collection of thoughts I've written down that haven't fit in any posts lately.  
  
The difference between models and super models: _fighting crime._  
  
**A couple of life tips:**  
  
* If someone correctly asks "should I turn left up here?", your response should not contain the word "right".
* Your political views are not polite to talk about in the elevator.
* You have free reign on anything in the world that is subjective. There are tons of subjective subjects. Things aren't so bad if you don't view them that way. Life is what you make it. Although somethings do just objectively suck.
  
Why is there not a "how to be an adult" class in school? There should certainly be some variant of "how to be a successful member of society" from middle school on up. You should ow to pay taxes, manage money, what general things you should and shouldn't be doing and why, how to take care of yourself, how to take care of someone else, life events, and all sorts of other stuff. These skills are all required to be a successful adult - why are kids expected to just pick these skills up from the aether? You could say "this responsibility is supposed to fall on their parents", but many parents don't, won't, or can't teach their kids these things.  
  
Does anyone actually hate saying _"I told you so"?_ Everyone who says it loves saying it.  
  
What are your goals? Not "two kids and a white picket fence" kind of goals, but "be a better dresser", "eat healthier", and be more well-read" kind of goals... what are they? Now let's pretend for a second that you have just accomplished all of those things. What does your life look like then? How is it different from your current life on a week-to-week, day-to-day, hour-to-hour basis?  
  
Last thing here, this is going to be a dumb, stretched out pun. You've been warned.  
  
I want to get a female puppy and raise her to adulthood. Then I'll take her to a breeder and get her pregnant. Once I'm sure she's pregnant, I'll take electric clippers and shave into her fur a heart with a stem coming out of the top middle. Then I'll take her to a vet and say she's been acting funny. When the vet examines her and says "she's pregnant", I'll look at the vet very seriously and say "that's not possible, she's been spade."  
  
Here's the picture(s) to go out on - prepare yourself:

Motto: I Guess Ryan Gosling is Okay  
  
This year I am back to my 30 Day Challenges. They bring a variety to life that I quite enjoy. I missed the feeling that the next 30 days might have some lasting impact, might reveal some hobby or trend that you wouldn't know you'd like, or might just be made slightly more interesting. Truthfully I don't know what I'd be doing if I wasn't always trying to better myself in some way. I feel like I'd just immediately get fat and give up on everything. The end of the year last year I fell off the horse... mostly due to an injury. But its lasting impact was the realization that, after 30+ days of not exercising, you sorta feel crappy all the time.  
  
So I lifted weights earlier (a lot earlier, this post was several weeks in the making) in my home gym. Which is awesome. Even more awesome once I **finish** it. Flooring. Walls. Maybe paint up the unfinished ceiling. Could make for a cool (if a bit expensive) 30 Day Challenge, actually.  
  
That's not this month, though. This month's 30 Day Challenge was to draw a self portrait that actually looked like me enough that someone who knows me could say "hey that looks like Aaron" if they saw it.  
  
What follows are the 12 drawings I made in January.  
  
#1 - the first attempt:  

[![](assets/305-1.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pPUA9MVB6hw/WI6vFY72bsI/AAAAAAAClY4/BqyXGEN%5FBCcdZx0u3K9ICxOOm-z2eQMtwCLcB/s1600/IMG%5F20170105%5F203749.jpg)

  
That was honest best effort at the time. I was pretty excited cause I thought "hey that looks kinda like me sorta!" My standards were a lot lower.  
  
#2 - progress, but not me:  

[![](assets/305-2.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Ehmj0dZE5Q/WI6vFQcji%5FI/AAAAAAAClak/%5FMmd8rSv-o0PUCC0z9bE0dblDIGvzR%5FXwCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170107%5F221350.jpg)

  
There are elements about this one that I very much like, but a larger number I do not like at all... and ultimately it doesn't look much like me.  
  
#3 - goofy picture, more obviously me:  

[![](assets/305-3.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vDfG%5FwjRjkk/WI6vFjA3n7I/AAAAAAAClak/6qkrupwoLCo7WB5kHVTfNxjF13ZePR2ggCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170108%5F201242.jpg)

  
This is the first one I drew that I think I would recognize as "that's supposed to be me". A friend told me "it looks like you because you didn't have a shirt on.  
  
#4 - a bit more ambitious:  

[![](assets/305-4.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-767VZ6RLbZo/WI6vINmjtEI/AAAAAAAClak/CqrTdhpdAM4MOWTmUZNLBsezkIdCnLCcACEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170110%5F205156.jpg)

  
One of the only times I've tried drawing a hand. I drew a derpy eye.  
  
#5 - goofy + ambition:  

[![](assets/305-5.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T0EUI0rhUtY/WI6vHt480EI/AAAAAAAClak/FIu1%5FwiA1qYhut52MFX0mIgStFTV0tHqACEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170111%5F203953.jpg)

  
I like this one a lot. Was my first time drawing plaid, also teeth.  
  
#6 - better tools + better effort:  

[![](assets/305-6.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zGWOSLm2XY8/WI6vKSEGiCI/AAAAAAACla0/xFlPpBGi7KM4ArcQPHRdO%5FcBuUSvVndIgCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170118%5F201932.jpg)

  
Between #5 and #6 I ran out and grab some better sketching paper & some actual sketching pencils (as opposed to the Crayola Black pencil I had been using). With the new tools, I decided to put in some extra time. I spent probably somewhere north of 5 hours on this one, significantly higher than drawing #1 which I knocked out during an episode of "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.". I didn't really know how to blend well just yet and there are a couple of proportions I'd like to change, but this is probably the best "Aaron's face" I've drawn to date. After doing this one, I decided I needed to diversify my drawings or I'd get get tired of drawing me over and over.  
  
#7 - drawing a girl (and a cat!):  

[![](assets/305-7.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-soefmcT-ing/WI6vH3dxOZI/AAAAAAAClak/s%5FwwRrggFFoTVMXO%5FlQ3MsGC5o78dsi9gCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170115%5F162157.jpg)

  
This was the first time I've ever managed to draw a girl that didn't like like a dude in drag.  
  
#8 - Body, bear, and butt:  

[![](assets/305-8.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ooh-IoUHz4k/WI6vKiB8ZvI/AAAAAAACla0/Osp44FgrjjYDAYOLDHScjnRFfOGRalQPgCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170123%5F213327.jpg)

  
When I decided to start drawing other people, this was the first picture that came to mind. It's my sister-in-law hugging wholesale-sized stuffed bear from Costco. It was the first time I set out to draw a full body, which didn't give me much trouble until I started trying to draw her butt. You ever draw your sister-in-law's butt a half dozen times? I have. She went from Kermit to Sir Mix-a-Lot style butt and back many times. It was weird. Also - drawing faces that small made correcting errors basically impossible without nuking the whole face with the eraser.  
  
#9 - A surprise gift:  

[![](assets/305-9.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bAF3t8Hk9V4/WI6vKrZJgUI/AAAAAAACla0/zQ8WfKkwh%5F846VXcAfGVOVDFBbyfrO3GwCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170125%5F204953.jpg)

  
Next in line for "photos I have to draw" was a picture of Nick from my wedding reception. Nick didn't know I was drawing this month, so I decided to sign it with a little heart and leave it on his desk at work.  
  
#10 - Jonboy and Thor:  

[![](assets/305-10.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EeG3YgD9qEU/WI6vMH8SVSI/AAAAAAACla0/1dxXV6K2piYEz8RHOc8OZBixN-6%5FZfr4QCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170126%5F232030.jpg)

  
This was fun to draw. The photo was too good to pass up. Loki is mad cause I have drawn Thor twice and haven't yet drawn her. That's some cat owner humor right there.  
  
#11 - a photo of me I love  

[![](assets/305-11.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VyqDlIwh96o/WI6vM07B3-I/AAAAAAAClbI/AqxtrSV9YC8C9rgJzc5zRGlEOBEweBCNACEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170128%5F140355.jpg)

  
This is one of my favorites, but was the most frustrating to draw. The paper looks much whiter because I took the photo with natural lighting. Probably should have done that for all of them.  
  
#12 - grand finale:  

[![](assets/305-12.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OxY9SAFw0ZM/WI6vM04AVuI/AAAAAAACla0/znmbpCTTw9U6-9v2bNwlWhCBjMmnOsbZQCEw/s1600/IMG%5F20170129%5F205608.jpg)

  
I didn't like my drawing of Melissa the first go around. I wanted to my 12th and final drawing to be a real challenge - I tried drawing one of my favorite pictures. You ever try to draw something beautiful? It's tough, dude.  
  
Cool.  
  
Next month's 30 Day Challenge: Costco food only. Wholesale savings and wholesale proportions.  
  
Totally unrelated: I saw La La Land. It was good.  
I like movies a lot. Enough to have majored in Film in college. Not enough to have _finished_ that degree, though... and I'm glad I didn't. Not because I have a cool engineering degree now and I use it to work a cool engineering job, but because if you've got a film degree you're contractually obligated to hate blockbuster movies (e.g. anything by Marvel) and socially required to suck up to other people.   
  
In not-so-chill news - December 10th I pulled a muscle in my back. After several weeks of "taking it easy", the muscle stopped bothering me and I started getting back after it some... but my extreme low back just started bothering me all the time. After about 6 months without any issues, I remember now what it's like to have chronic pain. I know it's temporary, though, and I cannot tell you how much you appreciate life and movement and all the little things when it's gone. Hopefully this flare up passes sooner rather than later.  
  
Just thought I'd end that on a downer note. YOU'RE WELCOME.  
  
Actually I'll end it with this photo to go out on:  

[![](assets/305-13.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8Bs-gkWTDFo/WI7Ak81-zyI/AAAAAAACldM/PrClYxVL8iUmZ2%5FudS2kZmkMhm9Qg9TBQCLcB/s1600/2017-01-28.jpg)

  
We had fun.  
  
Top 5: Favorite of those Drawings  
5\. #6 - Me that looks like me... because it was the first time that I drew somebody well enough that I think most people would recognize who I was drawing.  
4\. #12 - Melissa... because it is better than the first one. I literally just finished it so I'm docking it points intentionally due to timeframe biasing. It's not perfect, so it doesn't live up to the subject matter.   
3\. #9 - Nick... because it makes me laugh.  
2\. #10 - Jon with Loki... because it was easy and fun to draw.  
1\. #11 - me in the chair... because there's nothing about it that I'd like to go back and fix.

Motto: Rare Day

  
This is going to be a short post. It's late and my computer's dying. I just wanted to write a quick post and say this one thing:

  
**TODAY**

**WAS**

**AWESOME**

I knew it was going to be cool. There was a Marvel event, a new episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and a sneak preview of The Avengers: Age of Ultron. 

  
After that preview leaked online & Marvel decided to publish it early (see my previous post for more), they decided they were going to give us, the S.H.I.E.L.D. watching fans, a little bit extra. They gave us a scene from the movie. It was glorious.

  
The Marvel event was an announcement of every movie between now and 2019\. They blew away everyone's expectations with their announcements.  
  
[![](assets/214-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gNv%5Fdd0n4gg/VFBZSSajxCI/AAAAAAABf0E/yYh119XM6Jw/s1600/%23214%2B-%2Bmarvelstudios.jpg)

  
Is it 2019 yet?  
  
I am so happy to witness all this in my life.  
  
After all that craziness, I go to Reddit to find out what the hivemind has to say about the movie announcements and what do I find? News of Google Fit!  
  
Google unexpectedly and without announcement made Google Fit completely live. It's early on, but I really like what I'm seeing. I see great, great things in the future. Check the Top 5 for more.

  
Top 5: Changes Google Fit Will Bring

5\. When I get a chance to look into the developer information, I'll have the Life Tracker automatically populated with data from Google Fit.  
4\. Probably a new sleep tracker app that syncs with the fit cloud.  
3\. Likely a new diet tracker app that syncs with the fit cloud.   
2\. Perhaps a new workout app that syncs with the fit cloud.  
1\. Tons more automation. A beautiful interface. Bringing my Life Tracker (or parts of it) directly to my wrist.

Motto: This is a Column for Me, Not so much You

  
Like I said in the motto, this is a rant... and it's a rant that's very _"inside baseball"_, as they say. Feel free to read it, or skip it, either way. I warn you about this because I can't think of a single reader this Column applies to. If you want the gist of things, I'll include a TL;DR at the end.  
  
I have made videos on and off the past 10+ years now. I'm definitely not an expert video maker, but I think I'm at least "decent". I've managed to do generally everything I've tried to do when it comes to editing. As of last month, I had experience with 7 different editors.   
  
As of yesterday, that number is 12.  
  
My transition over to Linux has been admittedly painful at times, but I've managed to work through everything... except for video editing. I cannot find a video editor that suits my purposes.  
  
**Lightworks**  
  
When I made the jump to Linux, this was my plan. It's a very legitimate editor, used in the television and movies. Lightworks was used to edit "The King's Speech", "The Departed", "Pulp Fiction", "Braveheart", and many other things you've heard of and seen. It's been on this earth nearly as long as I have. So I felt like it was a fairly safe bet... Until I started using it.  
  
I've tried writing this next section in a concise way 3 times now, so I'm just going to use bullet points instead.  
  
Lightworks behaves completely differently than what I'm used to.  
It was designed to make heavy, almost exclusive use of the keyboard, increasing the learning curve substantially.  
Opting to use the mouse almost feels like punishment. It doesn't do what you'd expect.  
Performing very VERY basic tasks has required tutorial videos and text documentation.  
I have 99 Google searches including the term "Lightworks"... including these:  
"Lightworks audio transitions"  
"Lightworks transitions"  
"Lightworks fade to black"  
"Lightworks adding text"  
"Lightworks remove audio clips"  
"Lightworks learning curve"  
"Lightworks 120 fps"  
"Lightworks multiple frame rates"  
"Lightworks speed up a clip"  
"Lightworks import mp3"  
"Lightworks import formats"  
"Lightworks keyboard shortcuts"  
"Lightworks glossary"  
... and about 85 others that are some variant of "how do I do this, why isn't this working, help, tutorial, and/or what is going ON???  
The "delete" key closes the project. It doesn't DELETE.  
Slightly more advanced features, like changing global audio level for a track, I'm not even close to figuring out.  
Lightworks expects all video clips to have the same framerate. It plays 60 fps material at 50% speed. They can be sped up, but it's a manual process.  
It does NOT accept 120 fps video (much of my GoPro stuff)  
It randomly wouldn't import one mp3 file, while importing a different one that has all the same attributes so far as I can tell.  
Drag and drop works as you'd expect only about 50% of the time.  
You have to open a menu for everything.  
The menus are huge and give equal weight to things I feel like you'd need to touch constantly and things you'd only touch once per dozen projects.  
  
In general, Lightworks expects a certain workflow. That workflow require substantial learning and pre-planning to accomplish. If you don't operate it exactly like it wants to be operated, well then tough luck.  
  
**OpenShot**  
  
Going from Lightworks to OpenShot is like trading out a computer for an abacus. The interface is simple, to put it lightly. The feature set is (intentionally) limited. Keyboard shortcuts seem almost non-existent. I don't believe OpenShot is nearly capable of everything I want. OpenShot is very much the complete opposite of Lightworks in every way... which is bad.  
  
**Pitivi**  
  
Pitivi is the youngest entry into the field of editors I tried. It look somewhat promising at first... then it started causing system hangups. Even when it was working it had some fairly excessive lag issues. My system is not at all "top of the line", but it ran every other editor just fine. Also I had some issues inserting titles into the video.  
  
**Avidemux**  
  
See my comments for OpenShot. Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v.  
  
**Kdenlive**  
  
Kdenlive is the dumbest name of any editor I tried, and that annoys me more than it should. Beyond that, though, I thought I had solved my problem. Eveything looked the way it should. Everything behaved liked I expected. I was able to put the first 4 clips of "My 25th Year" on the timeline and cut them together how I want in under 15 minutes. It was the light at the end of the tunnel...  
  
Then the bugs started. I tried moving a clip that slid out of place temporarily... and it stuck. It wouldn't go. The interface just kept telling me it was unable to move the clip. So I tried deleting and re-adding the clip... but it wouldn't delete. The same interface just kept telling me it was unable to delete the clip. It was like the editor was HAL 9000 and it fell in love with a portion of the song "Keeping Warm" residing ~5 minutes into the project.  
  
I deleted the project and started over. Same thing happened with a different clip.  
  
I Googled it. Found out it's a known bug. No solution.  
  
Great.  
  
Why is this so difficult?  
  
**TL;DR - Linux video editors suck. Learning the one I thought was going to be good is like learning a foreign language... a foreign language with horrible yet strict grammar rules.**

Again, this Column didn't lend itself to a natural picture, so here's one from left field:

The bird in our plant ([from two Columns ago](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/07/183-lonesome-george.html) had some babies.

Top 5: Possible Solutions I'll Explore

5\. Try the unstable version of Kdenlive 4\. Try out "Cinelerra", which is just another Linux-based video editor. 3\. Give up. Reinstall Windows. Use it only for video editing. 2\. Learn to play ball with Lightworks. Accept its limitations and let it boss me around. 1\. Give up. Buy a Macbook or something. I don't want to go back to Windows.

Motto: Mic Check One Thousand Two Hundred Twelve  
  
I have a kid. He's really cool. He sleeps a lot. He eats a lot. He's very large for his age. His temperament is incredible. He smiles all the time. He's pretty easy to soothe most of the time. He looks like me mixed with Melissa, which I suppose is obvious but is really neat.   
  
Today Griffin giggled for the first time. I about cried out of happiness. That's something I never really experienced before having a kid. [I think there's a country song about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l%5FcCKLHRoo). Being a dad can be pretty cool.  
  
In other dad-related news - my lawn mower wouldn't stay running. I took it apart, cleaned the carburetor, and put it back together.  
  
  
[![](assets/354-1.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mPkFmg%5F9tA4/W8tcx45s2JI/AAAAAAADfkY/2n6xK95pEd85xe-%5F2uoqh022iloTkvwkACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG%5F20181019%5F152218.jpg)

  
Then it fired up on the first pull. Then I over-the-top-celebrated for a solid half hour before mowing the lawn.  
  
So that gives me dad cred... but I'm not king dad. Griffin doesn't have king dad. Griffin's grandpa was king dad. For evidence of that - see [Column #301](http://www.aarongilly.com/301).  
  
Moving on.  
  
Hollow Knight was incredible. I haven't touched it since last time I wrote and I still think about it on a daily basis. It was such an incredibly well-done thing.  
  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue>.  
  
I am going to do a better job of proofing these before I send them. I went back thru the past few I've written & realized just how _many_ typos I make on this. Or sentences that I'd start without f  
  
TRANSITION TO NEXT TOPIC.  
  
Google is great. I've written long about my fondness for the company. I would have defended every move Google made for a long, long time. I was a Google Plus advocate long after it was clear that I was flying the flag of a sinking ship. I've been using Android since the original Droid. I built the Life Tracker in Google Sheets, which I've been using daily for 5+ years. I literally own the book "What Would Google Do?". This blog is being written right now on Blogger, a Google-made product and typed on a Chromebook, while a TV show plays thru our Google Chromecast as requested on our Google Home.  
  
But.  
  
Google is not perfect. Google has made mistakes. Some of which I struggle to come to terms with. I've already written one Top 5, but this seems like it's fodder for another. So here comes a rare two-top-five Column.  
  
Top 5: Google Decisions I Can't Understand  
5\. "OK Google" and "Hey Google" are _incredibly_ annoying to say over and over. Just let me change the name of the Assistant.   
4\. Google's switch from the Nexus line of phones to Pixel phones. I don't care about the _branding_, but I do care about the change in philosophy. The Nexus phones were Google showing the world that you could have a premium phone without paying a premium price. They decided to go premium, but really have only succeeded to make their phones more expensive.  
3\. While we're on that note - they got rid of the headphone jack, they adopted the notch, they are doing what Apple does... just a year after Apple's done it. It doesn't feel like Google's got anything to say any more.  
2\. Google's schizophrenic approach to developing products. I could easily fill yet another Top 5 with "Google is developing both of these products that do the same thing"... often times it's more than two. Even now, Google Tasks is back from the grave - but does nothing that isn't already in Keep or the Assistant.  
1\. Google shuttering Google Reader. I was using it every day. Much like a lot of other folks. Them killing that service makes you realize that everything about "the cloud" is ephemeral. All these services and products I use could just roll over and die with no warning (and one day, will).  
  
The original Top 5.  
  
Top 5: Things I Wish I Had Another Weekend to Do  
5\. anything related to writing code - it's been a while since I've done anything with that for fun  
4\. make a sweet drawing of Hollow Knight - I've got a particular picture in my head I want to create  
3\. learn to do animations - I've got a particular song I'd like to do a simple animation for  
2\. hang out with my family outside - I didn't do any of that this weekend and massively regret that  
1\. research podcast stuff - I'm looking at podcast stuff, by the way

Motto: The World's Most Versatile Column

  
Today's post is a feature on GoPro - both the camera and the company. I'll cover both as objectively as possible and then I'll weigh in my opinions near the end of this post. First off, for those of you who don't know what a GoPro is: it's a camera. It looks like this:

You get the picture.  
  
The GoPro camera is manufactured by the company "GoPro". They have white kiosks in most higher-end consumer electronics stores or specialty shops.

The kiosk usually has 6-9 cameras on display, a dozen or so accessories, and this video playing:  
  
  
If not that exact video, some other very similar video. The GoPro promotional videos are beautiful. I've spent several hours of my life watching GoPro promotional videos on YouTube. They showcase not only the kind of "extreme" image that the company is working hard to promote, but also some less extreme videos that couldn't be done with a normal camera: These point-of-view type videos come from a category of cameras called "Action Cams". GoPro has tons of competition in this category - Sony, JVC, Garmin, Contour, Polaroid, and somebody called "Drift" all have multiple entries into the Action Cam market. The competition is no competition though. GoPro is THE brand name in action cameras. The competition is no competition. What Red Bull is to energy drinks, GoPro is to action cameras. I bring up Red Bull for a reason - GoPro and Red Bull have a very synergistic relationship. Their products are not competition for one another, yet they have a ton in common. They have established themselves as _the_ premium brand in their respective market. They go after the same consumer demographic. They go after them HARD. They promote adventure and the "extreme" lifestyle. They even use the same (or similar) blue accent color.

You can't tell me that there's not a similarity there. They are almost the exact same width and depth even. The Red Bull fits perfectly in the GoPro slot. Red Bull and GoPro have collaborate often: [Red Bull Flougtag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepWKlWBpYk) [Red Bull Signature Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepWKlWBpYk) \- a television program coming to NBC focusing on various extreme sporting events put on by Red Bull [Felix Baumgartner's record breaking jump from outer space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYw4meRWGd4)Oh, and my zipline experience in Haiti:

Here's an ad for Red Bull:  
  
  
Not only was \~1/2 of that ad made using GoPros, you can literally see one 24 seconds into the video... and the two snowboarders who hug at the end of the video have GoPro mounts on their helmets. Even if _none_ of that were true, how similar is that ad to the GoPro ad I linked to above?   
The GoPro/Red Bull relationship could literally be a Column of its own, but I'll just stop right here. GoPro is literally Going Professional here soon. They are having their initial public offering (they are transitioning from a privately owned company to a publicly traded company, you'll often see this abbreviated to "IPO"). Early reports say they will be positioning themselves as a 3 billion dollar brand. It's too early to tell exactly how that will effect everything, but it's worth mentioning. Speculation on the part of some journalists tells me that GoPro is positioning itself as a _media_ company moreso than a _camera_ company. GoPro's entire product catalog can be broken down into 3 sections: Cameras, Accessories, and Software. They give the software away for free - so you could really just say GoPro makes cameras and accessories. This is their entire camera lineup you can buy from [their website](http://www.gopro.com/):   

**Cameras:**

* Hero 3+ White Edition (cheapest)
* Hero 3+ Silver Edition (a middle ground)
* Hero 3+ Black Edition (most expensive)

Everything else is just mounts and accessories. They keep it simple.

  
So, that's all of the objective talk I wanted to get out before I moved onto my actual thoughts and feelings towards this subject. 

  
**My actual thoughts and feelings towards this subject:**

I love my GoPros.  
  
  
[![](assets/176-8.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3rvF6WJfN4A/U5yl%5FdSCe1I/AAAAAAABYK0/XnjBEvhPIZA/s1600/%23176+-+GoPros.jpg)

  
That photo is actually old. It shows two Hero 3 Silver edition cameras and I recently upgraded one of them to a Hero 3+ Black Edition.  
  
I bought my first GoPro immediately _after_ my trip to Thailand last year. I had been toying around with the idea of buying one for a while, but I couldn't even justify the $200-$400 purchase price. After all, I DO have a phone that takes good video and an actual point-and-shoot videocamera that takes great video. There was a moment in Thailand, though, while Melissa and I were snorkeling. She swam down to get a good look at a clownfish, and there I was. Seeing my beautiful fiance of one day eye-to-eye with Nemo amongst the coral with beautiful lighting... it was at that moment that I realized I would have _gladly_ paid the money - just to have a camera _for that one picture_.  
  
I told myself I'd never miss out on another opportunity like that, and bought a GoPro within two weeks of returning home.   
  
My wedding was filmed with several GoPros, one of which was positioned in a great and unique spot:  
  
  
[![](assets/176-9.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMZCq4D-Fp8/U54FBSUQR3I/AAAAAAABYRk/VXSAHTPd0tI/s1600/%23176+-+Wedding+Still.png)

  
That's a still from the video.  
  
After the wedding, we brought along a couple of GoPros for the cruise/honeymoon/vacation. During our trip I realized that taking a picture with a GoPro is an _entirely different experience_ than taking one with a regular camera. With a regular camera, you stop looking at what you are taking a picture of to look at your camera's screen to frame the shot. You put a window between you and what you are there to experience. GoPro cameras _have_ no screen. There's nothing to get between you and the experience. But how do you make sure you are getting the thing you are looking at in the picture? GoPros have a wide-angle lens. Even if you do a bad job of aiming the camera, it's going to be in the picture. GoPros have no zoom. They don't do anything other than give you a vivid recreation of what you saw when you were taking your picture... and that's a really nice feature for a vacation camera.  
  
Upon my return from the honeymoon, I decided to sell my older GoPro and use the funds to bankroll the upgrade to the new digs.  
  
I love the GoPro culture. Not the "this is so extreme!" nature, but the whole thing. People take this small, simple camera and create some of the most awesome and unique videos. For example:  
  
  
Whenever I see somebody else in the wild weilding a GoPro, I have to give the head nod. I have to give that acknowledgement that we are part of the same crowd.  
  
I fully recommend everyone who is even the slightest bit interested in getting a GoPro - do it. Do it and you will absolutely be glad you did. The first time you get something amazing on footage that you wouldn't have otherwise, you'll be glad. Heck, it might even _make_ you go do more fun stuff, just so you have the footage (see picture #1 from the Top 5).

Motto: If you can't eat it you don't need it.

I'm ending the October Project a few days early. First I'm going to post the picture you've probably already noticed. Next, I'm going to share with you my subjective and objective results. Finally, I'm going to reflect and give you my thoughts on the whole thing.  
  
**Picture:**  
  
  
[![](assets/127-1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e5cmC4oHMsc/Um8rwn21atI/AAAAAAABCXw/uYsd3kkUQjY/s1600/Column+127+-+Before+n+After.jpg)

  
**Subjectively:**   
* I feel like I fit clothes a bit better.
* My walk can now slightly more accurately be described as a "lumber".
* My hair got a little shorter, my shorts changed color, and I adorned wrist accessories.
**Objectively:**  
* My head circumference was off by 0.25 inches. Either I got way smarter or my measurements have a 0.25 inch margin of error. I used a control because science.
* My chest (under armpits and around) and my waist both grew by over an inch.
* My forearms, arms, and neck all grew by at least half an inch.
* My upper and lower legs and stomach didn't grow beyond my margin of error.
* I gained 7 pounds.
**Reflection & Thoughts:**   
* One of the strangest things about this whole project - I felt full for 2 weeks straight.
* Definitely _the_ strangest thing about the project - my scary consistent macronutrient ratios. The largest change in ratio was an increase in carbs by 0.25%; 1 part in 400.
* I successfully went 4 weeks without a highly caffeinated beverage... and it _suuucked_. It was the worst part of the whole project. I didn't feel like I was experiencing "withdrawal" at any point. No headaches or anything. I just found myself _wanting_ one.
* Despite my seemingly positive results, I underachieved in nearly every way. My average calorie intake was just under 3500, as opposed to my goal of 4000\. My protein intake was 170 when I aimed for at least 200\. I wonder what _could_ have been...

I ended the project after a particularly busy streak of 4 days got my data entry behind too far to be recorded with accuracy. I ended up having to nix all of last week's Life Tracking.

  
On a related note - I ate 2600 calories today. Just below my average before this whole October shenanigan started.  
  
**In other project-news:**  

  
The Mark 4 (my still newish car) is now the home of my 4th iteration of the EDC kit I keep in my trunk. It has gone by various names. I'm calling this one the "Trunk Monkey" as an homage to this video:
  
  
Anyway, without further dudes - here's what I have now:

Things I've already included:  
* 5'x7' tarp
* Poncho
* Camp towel
* Office supplies (post its and a couple pens you can't see)
* Unlabeled Altoid tin that currently has nothing in it
* Altoid Tin First Aid Kit
* Pack of cards
* Temporarily empty bin
* Flashlight
* Tire pressure gauge
* Flathead/phillips screwdriver
* Adjustable wrench
* Locking pliers
* A very simple Leatherman (basically just a knife and pliers)
* Paracord
* Small Altoid tin full of Acetaminophen
* Terrible gloves that need replacement
* Gear ties

Things I haven't gotten in there yet:

* More office supplies (binder and paper clips, rubber bands, sharpies, etc)
* Something for that unlabeled Altoid tins
* Something for that entirely empty bin
* A way to make fire
* More Small Altoid tins with various other small things
* Better gloves

The picture to go out on - this Halloween I dressed as a cat person. It was scary.

Motto: Oh Boo-Hoo  
  
I've been first-world struggling lately.  
  
[Five and one-third years ago I wrote a Column](http://www.aarongilly.com/109) about technological ecosystems. This is that table, updated for today:  
  
  
See those green highlights? That's what I'm using nowadays. Do you know how frustrating it is to have an iPhone and not use Safari, MacOS, Apple Maps, Airplay, iTunes, Apple Music, and Siri (I use Siri in some situations because I have to)?  
  
Using an iPhone, a Windows Desktop, and mostly Google services is not what you want to do. See the Top 5 for more whining.  
  
Somewhat related:  
  
It's crazy to me that I can't tell my Google Home what word(s) I want to say to get its attention. I'm not living in the future until I can say "Hey Jarvis", or "Okay Computer", or "Yo Black Mirror" when I want to know what temperature it will be today.  
  
Google's forcing the "Okay Google" or "Hey Google" to be the wakeword has literally interjected frustration with Google as an entity into my life. There's nothing worse than saying "Okay Google" for the 4th or 5th time. It makes you mad. You're mad and you're literally yelling at Google. It cannot be good for your company when I literally yell at it in frustration multiple times a week. I honestly think it's likely some subconscious part of me was interested in the iPhone because of my mounting frustration with Google.  
  
...said the guy on his Chromebook, writing on Blogger. They're fine. It's just stupid.  
  
It seems like the Price is Right Rule is backwards. "The closest without going over" should be "the closest without going under". First off, thematically it makes more sense to ask "how much money would you need to buy this thing" rather than saying "what's an amount of money that's just barely not enough to buy this thing." It would make the products being advertised on the show like better deals, rather than people saying "uh, looks like a $35 dollar blender" and the price actually being $50\. That makes it seem like everything on the show is a bad deal, or overpriced. LASTLY it would get rid of the bogus "$1, Bob" guess. That would translate into "ONE MILLION DOLLARS, BOB" if you think everyone else underbid.   
  
Top 5: Problems I've Run Into Thanks to Mixing Tech Ecosystems  
5\. I can't rely on the reminders I set on my Google Home or in Chrome to consistently show up on my phone  
4\. I can't see the calendar events I'm notified of on my phone because I don't want to use Apple's calendar app to access my Google Calendar (I eventually gave in on this)  
3\. I can't ask my Google Home to ring my phone if it's on silent which it usually is  
2\. I can't really use my computers to do anything interesting with my phone or each other  
1\. I can't ask Siri on my phone to navigate someplace because I don't want to use Apple Maps

Reminder: Include a Motto 

  
I haven't written much lately because I've been working late. My motto at work has been "when the going gets tough, the tough get going."

  
I've been using Google Calendar & Gmail since July, 2007\. My relationship with those two products is older than my relationship with my university. Gmail and Google Calendar haven't really changed much in the past 7 years. That is, they _hadn't_ changed much until about a month ago when Google unveiled their "Inbox" application and an updated Android Calendar app. They have been updated with new intelligence... and Google's "Material Design". In place of Google Tasks you get "Reminders", that you can set from multiple places.  
  
But, it's kinda weird how it works... and it's not at all obvious. Let me explain:  
  
You can SET reminders from Google Now, Keep, and Inbox. You can see your set reminders in those three apps and also Google Calendar. But not all reminders show up everywhere.  
  
I've sat here for half an hour trying pull off several elegant ways to describe how this works visually... but it's late and I'm both tired and an engineer, so here's a table:  
  
[![](assets/220-1.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tOx-C%5F5Edx8/VG7ZRbZzVRI/AAAAAAABhaE/TMub0-50OVo/s1600/Screenshot%2B2014-11-21%2Bat%2B12.16.31%2BAM.png)

  
It's got colors. That's the best I can do.  
  
Or, maybe this one:  
  
[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kPI3IuKbPlE/VG9rTeHvpPI/AAAAAAABhdE/FuKj6fKvK9s/s1600/14%2B-%2B1)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kPI3IuKbPlE/VG9rTeHvpPI/AAAAAAABhdE/FuKj6fKvK9s/s1600/14%2B-%2B1)

  
Isn't that a weird set of relationships? Google Keep exists in a silo... sorta. You can see Google Keep reminders from Google Now, but not from anywhere else. You can't see reminders from anywhere else in Google Keep. And you can't create reminders in the one app that would seem the most logical to create them from. Where's the consistency? How am I supposed to work this system?   
  
Also, why is Google Tasks still around if you aren't supporting it _at all?_  
  
Okay, if I don't start talking about the other thing I wanted to mention, I won't get to it. So here goes.  
  
I just watched "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1". It's a decent movie. The acting was good. The cinematography was decent. The music wasn't terrible by any means. In general there are many positive things to say about the movie.  
  
But it's the "Part 1" of a story that was never meant to be split into two parts. It's a 2 hour movie that has about an hour's worth of content. The pacing is slow. Several scenes felt like they were included just to fill time. Several other scenes felt like they were drawn out way longer than they should have been. This sentence contributes nothing to the paragraph, but I'm putting it here because it would feel cheap if I gave you a short paragraph. The ending of the movie is abrupt. It doesn't really feel like any sort of an ending. There's very little actually _accomplished_ in the story. It's a setup without any pay off.  
  
I am _not_ a fan of Hollywood's latest "Part 1 and Part 2" trend. Drawing out the end of your series by splitting what should definitely be one story into two parts is nothing short of a money grab. Worse than that, it's a money grab that cheapens the experience of the viewer. "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay" presented as 1 movie would have been awesome. As it is, it's just okay. When the next one comes out, I'll have to pay again to see it, and it will probably be just okay. The worst part of it all is that you won't be able to push The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and Part 2 together to get a compelling movie. You'll get one super long, very very slowly paced movie.   
  
Harry Potter started the trend, to the best of my recollection. While I agree with Melissa that Harry Potter had more of a _right_ to split the last book into two movies (it's \~750 pages long), I still think a single "Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows" would have been more than the sum of parts 1 & 2.  
  
Don't even get me started on "The Hobbit". That's ridiculous.  
  
Check back in 5 years when I make up some excuse/lame justification about how awesome and okay it was that Marvel split up the "Infinity War" movie into two parts.  
  
Speaking of movies - I noticed sometime in early October that NO GOOD MOVIES had come out in two months. Seriously, there was nothing. It was Guardians of the Galaxy, then NOTHING worth watching. Compare that to right now. Right now I want to see almost everything playing in theaters.  
  
Top 5: Movies Out Right Now I Want to See

5\. Big Hero 6 - even if it's aimed at kids  
4\. Nightcrawler - even if I have no idea what it's about  
3\. Interstellar - even if it's \~3 hours long  
2\. Dumb and Dumber To - even if it's probably terrible, I'll watch it  
1\. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 & John Wick & Gone Girl - even if I've already seen all of them

Motto: Adept at being Inept  
  
This isn't going to be fun to read, but It was fun to write.   
  
I'm not writing about any of the things that have happened lately that would be considered "interesting". You _can_ stop here. No really, it's okay. I'll even do the picture to go out on!  
  
[![](assets/331-1.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y9YQh60cs4c/WmKusCU30rI/AAAAAAAC4m8/UjjRuGX6olklRCrbWYWxBg%5FM4yu%5FiDQfACKgBGAs/s1600/download%5F20180115%5F191759.jpg)

  
Not bad Google.  
  
You should stop.  
  
Alright, your loss.  
  
2018 has coincided with my best New Year's Resolution yet: **No Zero Days.**  
  
Meaning - I will work, at least a little bit, every single day, toward one of the following:  
* Home improvement (not just maintenance)
* Getting a Master's and/or PE and/or PMP certification
* Creating an Android App
* Physical fitness
* The other thing
* +whatever else I deem appropriate for my long-term development
Over the holiday, I had a new experience - I failed to escape an escape room. I'm shooting 7 for 8 now. I got to see a new take on the escape room concept. I got to see what a _bad_ room is like. A BAD room...  
  
1\. Has too many red herrings - especially if the right path forward isn't obvious in hindsight  
2\. Has clues that can be ruined by someone moving them  
3\. Has finicky locks  
4\. Has two or more of the same kind of puzzle, without it being a theme of the room  
5\. Has no _real_ effort put into the decorations  
  
Now, you could probably argue that I only think the room was bad because I didn't get out. That might be fair BUT IT WAS NOT GOOD!  
  
The rest of this Column is me scratching a curiosity itch I have right now relating to podcasts.   
  
I am now going to attempt to count up the total number of Podcast episodes I've listened to/half paid attention to in my life. Rather than fuzzing the numbers by estimating the number of "rebroadcast"-type episodes I've listened to, I'm going to only consider the unique episodes I've listened to since I first found out about podcasts 5 1/2 years ago.  
  
This American Life - 625  
Nerdist Podcast - 500  
**The Weekly Planet** \- 220  
All About Android - 200  
This Week in Google - 200  
**Good Job Brain!** \- 198  
This Week in Tech - 150  
Freakonomics - 150  
**Radiolab** \- 150  
**Do Go On** \- 117

**Serial** \- 23  
Planet Money - 20  
Hardcore History - 12  
Pod Save America - 10  
**S-Town** \- 7  
\+ 50 random episodes of other stuff over the ages  
  
**Bold** indicates I've heard every available episode.  
  
That's 2822 episodes. I first learned about podcasts during a trip I took in August, 2012\. That's slightly under 2000 days ago. In other words, I've averaged somewhere close to 1.5 podcast episodes a day. Factor in episodes I've heard more than once and you'd definitely hit 1.5 episodes a day.  
  
How about that.  
  
Top 5: Catchphrases I'm Workshopping  
5\. How about you just _give_ me a fish, I'm tired of learning  
4\. "That's dam fine" said the beaver.  
3\. I wouldn't mind having that on my gravestone.

Motto: GREAT SCOTT!

  
Yesterday was "Back to the Future" day. That is popular knowledge right now. I'm not stating that not so much to inform you now, but moreso as a reference for the future to give this Column some context.  
  
Anyway, in Back to the Future 2 we got to see what 1985 America thought 2015 America would look like. There were some articles that came out yesterday in which people predicted what life will look like in 30 years... I think they were all wrong. Here's my 100% "or your money back" guaranteed predictions for the year 2045:  
* I will be 57 years old (or dead). I'll weigh 240 pounds. Slightly heavier than I am now. I will have aged like fine wine… with the face of a sophisticated gentleman.
* Mizzou will _still_ not have a Men's Basketball National Championship... likely will still not have even gone to the championship game... or the Final Four.
* We will still not be flying everywhere we go (unless somebody recreates Tony Stark's arc reactor and repulsor technologies).
* Everyone's mom will be named "Elsa".
* Most forms of travel in the civilized world will be automated. Welcome to your Johnny Cab.
* All computers will be made by the one, all-encompassing tech company: Microgoogpple.
* We will have cured a couple cancers, not others. The common cold will still be common.
* We will discover alien life, but we will be more advanced than they are. We will abduct several and probe them in what we _think_ is _probably_ their mouths to find out more about their species.
* We will land people on Mars.
* One of the people will accidentally be left on Mars, only to be rescued by a wormhole that some 4th dimensional beings placed behind Saturn. HAL won’t open the pod bay doors for Sandra Bullock. I’m mixing together space movie references, get it?
* We will have a global network of connections. You'll literally never be out of reach of signal anywhere on the surface of the planet. The ubiquity of this connection will enable our societies to advance in ways that only the fringiest of the fringe nerds are experimenting with today. You'll have a "personal cloud" of media, services to which you subscribe, health and diagnostics information, and productivity information that you can access from literally anywhere using one of many different form factors of device. Keys won’t be a thing. You are the key. Augmented reality will become more popular, and as such, wearables will become more the norm. The audio and visual inputs to your brain will reside in a thing on your head. You won't need a phone with a screen and speakers any more. We will effectively become cyborgs, without the need to splice machinery into our bodies.
* We will still work 40 hour weeks, despite dozens of advancements and automations that should have rendered the working week to 30 or 20 hours.
* We will have removed the barriers of communication between people. The translation apps we have on our phones today will translate in real time - and in a voice similar to the person with whom we are talking. Phone calls will still be called phone calls, even though the notion of a physical phone will be somewhat recently outdated (similar to how we “dial” a phone today, even though our phones no longer use _dials_.
* Teenage girls will start reading Frankenstein romance novels. A fanfiction Frankenstein romance novel will spin off into a real, but unrelated set of novels called “51 Shades of Grey”. It will be renowned as “truly being 1 better than the original”.
* 4+ of these predictions will turn out true, including at least 1 joke prediction.
To keep things interesting there I alternated between being serious and joking every other prediction.  
  
Here's an unrelated picture to go out on... I told a few people I needed to make this GIF for when I make a terrible joke for the sake of making a terrible joke:

Top 5: **Things Marty McFly would be disappointed by in actual 2015**

5\. Cars don't fly.  
4\. Nobody wears clear neckties.  
3\. We don't have 19 sequels of Jaws. Instead we have 19 prequels, origin stories, reboots, and spinoffs of every franchise that's ever existed.   
2\. Our videogames still use physical controllers.  
1\. The things we call "hoverboards" have frickin' wheels. C'mon, science.

Motto: Writing Wrongs  
  
That monitor situation I talked about in my previous post got resolved. I successfully returned the 4K monitor, lessons learned. Earlier this week I procured this new 27 inch, 1440p monitor. It's a high-end version of the middle-tier of hardware. That's the same philosophy I built my computer with, and that has served me well thus far. Rather than getting a low-end high-tier piece of hardware (like I had), where there were corners cut and expenses spared - this new monitor has a great stand, wonderfully saturated colors, and it came with basically every cable that one could possibly use to connect it to stuff. I'm very happy with the new screen and the new dual-screen setup.  
  
I've been playing a lot of videogames lately. I partially blame Fallout 4 for being such a great game. I partially blame my work for actually being mentally taxing (causing me to have less excess mental energy). Mostly, though, I blame myself for not being ambitious enough. I don't know exactly _what_ I should be doing - but perhaps something more productive. When Melissa isn't in school we'll hang out & play games and stuff... but in the meantime, maybe...  
  
Develop Android apps?  
Learn to play music? (ha)  
Make some new humorous videos?  
Take up jogging?  
Practice juggling?  
Competitive sculpting?  
House flipping?  
Turtle grooming?  
  
Maybe I should cut myself some slack. I work, workout, play basketball, cook, and clean. It's not like I'm bumming around wasting life.  
  
A new Hitman is coming out. As I've written about before, I'm a fan. I grew up with the franchise. Enjoyed playing it as a kid. Played the last one. Looking forward to their "episodic releases" this year.  
  
I don't have much to write about. This post was made due to an abundance of convenient time moreso than an abundance of inspiration.  
  
The picture to go out on - my new desk setup.

# Motto: Graphics Interchange Format

Here's a GIF.

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE. This was lost to history.

Google's Autoawesome feature on Google+ stitched together several photos I took to make that animated GIF. Autoawesome is awesome.

Speaking of GIFs, there was a weird resurgence of my JIF GIF again three days ago. 

I woke up and read the column I posted on Wednesday. I clicked the "JIF GIF" link from the Top 5 and scrolled down. I found this:

![](assets/113-1.gif)

That's an Australian kid that looks like a scrawnier, more braces-having version of me doing a cover GIF using a cleaning product they have down there called "JIF".

Later that same day, the very popular and well-established site "Imgur.com" created a community on Google+ called "Best of GIFs". Their inaugural post made my day.

![](assets/113-2.png)

I know I wrote about the JIF GIF a couple of posts back. I don't want to keep writing about it. So I'm going to stop.

This weekend was great. Productive. Fun. The works.

Danielle's cat typed that "2".

I told you this was going to be short.


# Top 5: Companies I Refuse to Support Because of Their Stupid Ads

5. GoDaddy. Their over-sexed Super Bowl commercials make positively zero sense for the product they sell. They are over the top and low brow. GoDaddy sucks.
4. Old Navy used to have really dumb commercials. They've cut back on them, though. They're safe.
3. Every single politician that has ever been on TV ever.
2. Progressive. Flo is annoying.
1. Microsoft. Microsoft is the **worst** offender here. The ads for the original Surface were a bunch of people dancing around waving the thing all about. They were visually appealing, but lacked any information about the device. They might have been waving around an electric scale. The Scroogled ads against Google are horrible and misleading - not to mention terribly produced, acted, and written. Lastly, the new iPad bashing apps they have for the Surface. They use Siri's voice to point out how you "can't plug in a USB port" and how the iPad doesn't have a keyboard like the Surface does. The keyboard costs extra and you can buy a keyboard case for the iPad for the same amount, and nobody should be using a USB port on a tablet. The target audience for all of their ads seems to be only the most uniformed, unintelligent potential customer.

# Balancing Optimized Results and Enjoying the Process
I've come to see a flaw in one of my core philosophies. The idea, which I've written about on here before, is that <span style="color: red">**standardized routines enable satisfactory results while freeing the mind to think about bigger and better things**</span>. The flaw I've come to realize with a blind application of this approach is that it can kill the fun of the journey.

## Coffee Example 
I make coffee at the same time every day, following the exact same set of steps. My routine produces the right amount of coffee with the right level of strength, in a minimal amount of time, and leaves me with clean counter. I can do this set of 6 steps in my sleep. Literally. I do it first thing in the morning. I've made coffee, gone back to sleep, and not remembered doing it.

The idea of here is that making coffee is now a solved problem. I no longer have to think, and therefore I'm free to consider life's bigger problems. I can think about what I want to accomplish today. I can think about how to solve a problem that's been dogging me. I can think about whatever I want, and still produce the black magical elixir of happiness. It's multichannel multitasking at its finest.

Here's the rub: because I follow this routine, the act of *making coffee* no longer provides me any level of satisfaction. It's not inherently pleasing. I don't stop and smell the beans. I have freed my mind to think about anything, and as a result I have been "freed" to use my coffee making routine as a time to continue to be anxious about this or worry about that. 

## Bath Example
I am the parent that handles bathtime around this house. It used to be a big ordeal. I'd regularly request assistance. I'd regularly have to stop in order to fetch forgotten items or go back and re-do steps. I'd have to ask my 1 year old to change positions repeatedly. Through a series of dedicated and intentional process improvements I've got a bathtime routine that I can accomplish in no more than 5 minutes, producing a satisfactorily clean child in the process.

Now that I've run out of inefficiencies to smooth out, bathtime has turned into a chore. It's become a thing that I have to do, rather than a thing I enjoyed doing. My child gets to enjoy short tub times, but that's not the point.

## In Summary

This is not an *abandon all hope, ye who enter here* situation. It's not something where the bathwater needs to go, regardless of where the baby is located. Optimization is a good and worthwhile endeavor; but it shouldn't be blindly pursued. A well-optimized life isn't the be-all and end-all goal at the end of the day. The solution is *balance*, above all else. That is and always has been my #2 Life Pro Tip[^1]. 

![[393-6.jpg]]

Or, another way of putting it:

> The point of life isn't to optimize as many things as possible, it's to *enjoy* as many things as possible.

# Other Thoughts  
## Ending Quarantine
Quarantine seems like it's coming to a close. I don't think I utilized my time poorly at all, aside from possibly getting a little too good at Super Smash Bros. I revamped my site. I read a bunch of books. I spent a lot of evening with my wife and son. I got back into digital drawing. I practiced guitar. I learned some neat coding stuff. I wrote some notes. I wrote some posts. I worked out. I made a bunch of podcasts. I went on walks with the family. I taught myself CAD and built a standing desk.

It's funny to think now that we went out and bought a puzzle right before all this started so "we'd have something to do during quarantine". We would never have guessed I'd be writing about slowly coming out of it 3 1/2 months later - into a new world full of expanded personal space bubbles and people drawing smiles on their masks to make things seem less cold and unfriendly.

## CotW
My [[Creations Catalog|Creation of the Week]] project is humming along. The page itself could use some TLC, but I'm happy to have established a public repository for creative output. I can't wait to see it in a year, or five.

# Top 5: Post-ish Quarantine Activities We've Done

Motto: Not Sure

  
I have no plans for this post. It's 10PM. At some point in time over the past 3 weeks 10PM became my bedtime. I'm tired, tired in a way I don't normally feel. Could be stress from the new job. Could be a body tired of fighting off infection - everybody I know has been sick over the past 2 to 3 weeks. It could be anything. All I know is I went from having trouble falling asleep at night to having trouble staying up past 11.  
  
Melissa and I are getting married in one month and seventeen days. It's hard to believe it's real. You plan something for months. Then it happens. You are there.   
  
Then you were there.  
  
Then what?  
  
I've got a lot to learn.  
  
Also - I've got a lot I _want_ to learn... and a lot I want to _do_. I look forward to the future. You could probably say I'm antsy.  
  
Antsy, and tall.  
  
Guess which one I get asked about more often.  
  
I'm not sure what this was. If it sucked reading, I apologize. I'm supposed to write something every day. Today should have been a Moleskine day, but it's too late for that.

Top 5: Projects I'm Going to Start after the Wedding

5\. Look into graduate school. Figure out what I want to do to formally further my education.  
4\. Android development. I want to build something. I almost don't care what.  
3\. Relearning what I learned in college through a long, long process of review, research, and writing. I want to learn things, then explain them on paper in such a way that I'd understand them if I were my own audience.  
2\. Loading a Linux distro onto my Chromebook and onto my full laptop. Then learn computers.  
1\. Stretch goals: Learn Spanish. Learn piano.

I am working on a long-ish post to end up the year. That's not this. Most of what I want to say is going to be in that. 

I'm working to improve my writing process. I don't mean "make the writing better"; I gave up on that a long time ago. I mean "make it *easier*". I'd like to make it easier to include drawings into these.

# Motto: It has been a Very Interesting Quarter-Century


I am 25 years old. My birthday was this past Thursday, August 1st. I would like to say "I can't believe how old I am! Where did the time go!?" I think that's what you are *supposed* to say...

But, I know the answer to that. I can believe how old I am. What I can't believe is that before I turn fifty I will get to live another day for each day I have been already been alive. I will have at least my current level of understanding and faculty, my current level of independence and capability. I get to relive all the days I've lived thus far, except I get to make all the choices I never got to make when I was a kid; and I gotta say, I look forward to it.

My 25th birthday party was easily the best one I have in memory. All my best friends from the various aspects of my life got together, got to meet one-another, and got to just hang out. Nothing crazy. Nothing too boring, either (at least, not in my eyes). It included (probably) the best Rick Roll of all time, followed by the official screening of the Second-a-Day video for a dozen of my favorite people in the world.

Without further ado, My 24th Year:

{% include video id="8_AwZQKjplc" provider="youtube" %}

Looking forward, I still have a lot of ambitions. I haven't reached max level yet. I have plans. I have goals.

One of my plans/goals - Second-a-Day: My 25th Year.

5. October 27th - Alissa gets married
4. September 24th - my first day of my first real job

2. December 26th - My family finds a long-lost favorite family video
1. April 9th - the proposal

Motto: Coding with a mug full of Java... C what I did there?  
  
Full disclosure - I'm multitasking.  
  
Yesterday evening I picked back up [where I left off 8 months ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/261). My goals have changed since that time, though. I am not currently operating under the assumption that I will finish all these classes as sort of a preparation for graduate schooling in computer science - but instead I will take these classes because I enjoy doing so. Also, I would like to be able to write [The Life Tracker a.k.a. Captain's Log a.k.a. NamePendingThingIDo a.k.a. QUANTIFY YOSELF FOOL](http://www.aarongilly.com/p/feature-life-tracker.html) as an Android(/possibly iOS?) application.  
  
I don't ever close down dreams. I adjust them to fit my life circumstances.  
  
Anyway, I'm multitasking because I just started with the most basic-fundamental "How to Code for Android" course available. It's targeted at way below my level (#smug), but I want to start as slowly and easily as possible so as not to out-kick my coverage (something that happened last time when I started with the intermediate stuff). Also - as I found out with other Udacity classes I've taken, there's usually _my_ way of doing things and then the _correct_ way, which is always better.   
  
I can pretty easily split my attention for now. I know from experience that this will get pretty challenging in future courses.  
  
In other news - I bench-pressed 225 this morning for the first time. I've been struggling to raise my bench numbers for years. So, finally pushing through this milestone barrier (225 is the bar plus two 45's on each side) felt really really good. My deadlifts recently hit the 315 milestone, too. I look forward to when those weights become my working sets.  
  
Now my head is as big as my lifting numbers.  
  
In other news - a lightning strike caused a fire super close to my place. That was eye opening. Stuff like that doesn't happen to you, right?  
  
Here's what it looks like, 24 hours later:  
  
[![](assets/292-1.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2E853EBU%5FLc/V3HEA4F89II/AAAAAAACWiE/ivUmKpEHba8foh70jNNq5XnlnW4MnpxPQCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160627%5F160258.jpg)

  
That's crazy.  
  
Top 5: Things I Say "Why Don't I Do This More Often?" About  
5\. Writing code.  
4\. Riding my bike.  
3\. Using Plex. It's so cool.  
2\. Create art of any form.  
1\. Seeing friends. I do this significantly more than all of the above, but you can never have too much.

Motto: I've got so much to tell you!

  
I have a lot to talk about. First I'm going to say - if you noticed the new favicon, I'm impressed. If you don't see it, you will eventually. If you don't know what that is - it's the little icon next to the website name up there. **↑**  

  
It's really small - but it's this:

| [![](assets/261-1.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PrIuQHInCzM/VeeQ2FvBY4I/AAAAAAAB8Bc/81YX0cpNw-s/s1600/aarongilly%2Btransparent.png) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not meant to look good any bigger than this.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I'd like to make a better version of that sometime... but that's good for the foreseeable future.

  
Also at the top of this page - a couple of sections: Projects & Videos. Those are a little more full. I plan on putting some more work on the Projects section soon.

  
August's **30 Day Challenge** was an ambitious one. My goal was to, each day:

  
* Run a mile
* 100 pushups
* 15 pullups
* Drink only water & coffee
* Eat in, eat up
* Bed at 10
* Wake at 6
* ...and my stretch goal: Stretching (for 15 minutes)
  
The results:

I maybe did more running, pushups, pullups, and eating in than usual... but not by much. I think my eyes were bigger than my mouth with that one. I'm going to pitch myself a nice slow one over the center of the plate for this month. I mixed metaphors there, but that's okay.

  
**September's 30 Day Challenge: study 1 hour a day.**

  
The idea is to start getting ready for graduate school; but it could be anything, really. I've been doing Udacity coursework for the past few nights. Building webpages that contain pictures of cats that you click on. 

  
Udacity has been a really fun way to prep for grad school. Following along with the "JavaScript Design Patterns" course I've built a more and more robust version of the "Kitty Clicker" page.

It's one of the most sophisticated things on the web. I'm pretty sure.

  
The new "Google" was a much bigger deal than I expected. I thought it was cool and all, but... I saw it on the local news. That's weird.

  
The second generation of Android Wear watches is coming out shortly. This includes the first few watches that are objectively _better_ than the Moto 360 on my wrist right now. I don't think I'll get anything new until this one breaks or the battery doesn't last from 7am to 10pm, whichever comes first.

  
In 7 days, Apple will announce the next batch of iPhones. I'm not 100% sure what they are going to be called. Most places you look will say "iPhone 6s"; but I'm not solid on Apple selling _anything_ with such a stupid name as "iPhone 6s plus". Either way, they are supposed to be not all that much better than the iPhone 6... but that's fine. No phone has been compelling to me since the iPhone 6 came out. 

  
On that same note - Google's Nexus & Android Marshmallow launch is likely going to be September 29th. I sincerely hope it's what I hope it will be. My 2013 Nexus 5 is getting long in the tooth. 

  
Top 5: Udacity Course I've Done So Far

5\. Website Performance Optimization  
4\. Intro to HTML & CSS  
3\. JavaScript Basics (you're about to notice a trend)  
2\. Object-Oriented JavaScript  
1\. JavaScript Design Patterns, where I built Kitty Clicker _Premium_.

Motto: I wanted to _Share_ this with you  
  
The Stock Market doesn't make any sense, I can't believe it's a thing. It seems to me like a form of gambling, that's simultaneously nonsensical and very commonplace.  
  
Here's what I DO get:  
To start, a "dollar" is just a unit of value, the same way that "meter" is a unit of length. Only, the dollar unit technically changes from time to time with regard to how much "value" it refers to, it's pretty stable. You have the option of converting some of your dollars into "shares" of a company. A "share" is a unit of value in the same way a dollar is, but it's relative value changes with the relative total value of the company. So, you convert some of your static-sized _dollar_ units into dynamically-sized _share_ units, in hopes that the _share_ units will represent more value over time. At some point you convert your shares back to dollars, hoping to have more dollars than you had to begin with.  
  
Okay, cool, but what determines the value of a company? From what I can gather, the value is just "what people are willing to pay for each share" times the total number of shares. So, what determines the amount people are willing to pay for each share? Seems like it's the value of the company. It's circular logic. The snake is eating its own tail. Or maybe the tail is wagging the dog? I'm not sure, but definitely some tail metaphor should apply.  
  
I have Googled:  
"What determines the value of a company"  
"What determines the price of a stock"  
"What determines the demand for a stock"  
Those three searches in a circle over and over, trying to figure out anything that makes sense.   
  
It's like I heard a new word "_felogy_" whose definition I didn't know. Then I looked it up in the dictionary and saw the definition for felogy was "_meembege_". Then looked up "_meembege_" to find its definition was was just "felogy". It's a circular path of unhelpfulness.  
  
I started to draw out some notes... but didn't really go anywhere with it. I wanted to make a metaphor where value = total shaded area, but quickly realized it wouldn't help illustrate the portion of the concept that made no sense.  
  
  
[![](assets/321-1.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GB0dtXdDiE0/WYYq3%5FasosI/AAAAAAACuTQ/uP-ZFmChKncFM5kj5dWLF5G86Pl6D9FVQCLcBGAs/s1600/%2523321%2B-%2Bstocks.png)
  
  
What is the benefit of holding shares of a company _other_ than that you may be able to sell them for more money later? Why does anybody want them if they hold no intrinsic value? Dividends seem like one possible answer, but I know those aren't always a thing. So, why get a stock for a company that doesn't pay dividends? What keeps the whole thing going? How did this crazy idea get started in the first place?  
  
Same thing applies with Bitcoins. People buy bitcoins because they are valuable, but they are only valuable because people buy them. Makes no sense.  
  
A couple weeks back I decided to sell my two old GoPros on Craigslist and use the sales to buy a new GoPro HERO5 Session. It's really revitalized my interest in using GoPros to films stuff. I'll go into more detail in my Top 10, below. One reason is that it is compatible with the new "GoPro QuikStories". GoPro QuikStories are pretty sweet. I hung out with my in-laws over the weekend and did some filming, got to my phone later and had had this video waiting for me:  
  
  
Note I added the text at the beginning manually, just to see how I could change things.  
  
That's pretty neat. If GoPro does the editing for you - it's a lot easier to just, take one with you for a weekend trip & pull it out from time to time to film stuff. At the end of the weekend, wind up with a cool little video capsule showing the highlights of the weekend? Sweet.  
  
Lastly, for my birthday my wonderful wife bought me a Nintendo Switch, which I have been clamoring on about since I saw the debut trailer a long time ago. I've been wanting on a long time, but haven't been sure what it would be like to actually own. Turns out, it's pretty sweet. First off, the new Legend of Zelda game is incredible thus far. It takes all the things I liked about the old Legend of Zelda games I played growing up and combines it with all of the things I liked about Fallout 4, then puts it together in a really pretty package.  
  
Beyond LoZ, the system itself is really nice. It feels much more premium than I expected. The rail system for the Joycons gives a really satisfying "click" when they're in place. Pulling the switch out of the dock switches you to handheld mode immediately. Turning it off and back on is basically instant. Combine those things and it's like the dream you had when you were a kid. What if I could take my video game with me on the road? What if I didn't have to stop playing when I went to bathroom! I have played Legend of Zelda on the toilet. It's a great feeling. No shame.  
  
The game catalog for the switch is admittedly shallow for the moment. I only tend to buy about 1 to 1.5 video games a year, though. So this LoZ will last me until Super Smash inevitably comes out. Or if I hear the new Mario game is amazing, I'll pick that up.   
  
Marvel movies are coming out 3 times a year, and they're always great. I have a video game system that I can project onto the wall, or play while I'm in line at the DMV. I can make cool drawings on my computer. My GoPro works with my phone to make videos all by itself. I have friends, a house, and a beautiful wife who loves me.   
  
What a time to be alive.  
  
Top 10: Immediate Perks of the New GoPro (Over My Old Ones)  
10\. It takes 1 button push to turn the camera on and start recording  
9\. It's smaller, which is neat  
8\. Because the camera is symmetric, it can be rotated inside of the frame, eliminating the need for goofy right-angle bends in mounting  
7\. It's waterproof without a case  
6\. It stays in communication with my phone, even when it's off (somehow)  
5\. It's compatible with the new GoPro Quikstories, which I have REALLY enjoyed these first two days  
4\. You can charge it while it's mounted  
3\. The battery lasts longer than either of my old ones  
2\. No case means no annoying GoPro case noises in your video  
1\. It uses the same cable as my phone - seriously, this alone is what pushed me over the edge for making the switch and I appreciate it every time... now my Switch, laptop, camera, and phone all use the same charger... the USB C promise has come to fruition and it's an incredible thing for people who like to keep things simple

Motto: Get Over It, Dude

  
January 2014 Melissa and I did the Paleo + CrossFit 30 Day Challenge, which was a resounding success all around. January, 2015 we were going to do the same challenge, but really only the Paleo part because we already have a gym we like.   
  
We kind of forgot about the whole thing... pretty much immediately.  
  
January 2015 will now forever be known as the month of "The Faileo Diet". Luckily, failure _is_ an option with these things. It was never a solid commitment. We didn't talk about it enough going in. This month will be better.  
  
**February 2015: No TV\*, no videogames\***  
  
\*Except for Fridays, which we will utilize as cheat days. This way we can still keep up on our currently running shows and maybe I won't lose anything I have going for me in Battlefield.  
  
So, that's the deal.  
  
Now, for my second and last topic, I'm going to revisit something [I've written about](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/02/141-ad-nauseum.html) [again](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/01/136-chrome-in-all-its-forms.html), and [again](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/07/99-feature-on-tools.html), and [again](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2012/05/8-donnie-darko-edc-fruition.html).  

  
Friday when I was leaving work, I don't remember exactly what I was doing, but I remember it involved my Timbuk2 bag and wanting to do something with it that it was not capable of doing (not capable in the capacity I wish it were, at least). It got me thinking "how would I change this bag to make it "perfect". I got all excited by the idea to create a hypothetical "perfect" bag. I thought about it on and off all weekend. 

  
The perfect bag. There's obviously no such thing, in general terms. There's only the perfect bag "for your needs". For _my_ needs, unfortunately, there's still no perfect bag out there. One doesn't exist that does everything I want without the stuff I don't. One _could_ be made, but I'm confident it hasn't been. If it had, I'd have found it by now. 

  
My perfect bag would integrate the following in a logical and consistent way:

  
1. Water resistant (rain proof)
2. Laptop sleeve
3. Waterbottle holder (capable of contain Nalgenes)
4. Admin pocket with exactly 3 pen slots and two pockets sized appropriately to hold a pack of cards, but not much more ("cards" are just a size gauge there).
5. High quality materials
6. Clean overall look
7. Spot for sunglasses
8. Spot for CCW
9. Secret money pocket
10. Most/all pockets bottom out at the _bottom_ of the bag
  
The picture to go out on is some doodles I made whilst trying to create my own "perfect bag":

I finally ended up with something very similar to the [Timbuk2 Command bag](http://www.timbuk2.com/command-tsa-friendly-ipad-laptop-messenger-bag-2014/268.html) (with 5+ key differences):  
  
[![](assets/230-2.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sdAdH3tdUEI/VNAyCWrkmvI/AAAAAAABmOM/fdCYK3HxlNw/s1600/IMG%5F20150202%5F122505.jpg)

Top 5: Difference Between What I Drew and The Timbuk2 Command Messenger

5\. The admin pocket moves from the front, floppy part of the bag to the more likely to be rigid back part.  
4\. The waterbottle holder completely unzips to give you a mesh bottle holder. I also considered making this side of the bag MOLLE webbing. I'd probably do that, in retrospect. I want to be able to hold my Nalgene if I want, and have no bulk if I don't want to hold anything.  
3\. The whole thing doesn't zip in half. This feature is awesome, provided you're flying often. If you don't fly much, it makes the added weight/complexity unnecessary.  
2\. The "Napoleon" pocket is larger, and has an internal (top) opening in addition to the external (side) opening. Frankly, that second part is actually pretty good. Timbuk2 I'll sell you that idea for cheap.   
1\. I added some of the features of the 2014 Timbuk2 classic messenger. The strap style, the interior side pockets, the simplified face pocket.

Motto: A Place for Every Datum, and Every Datum in its Place  
  
Last Column I briefly mentioned a blog I found called "Minding the Borderlands". That site, in addition to its value as a primary resource, was a valuable kicking off point for expanded research into some topics I'm going to write about today. I read the book "Getting Things Done". I read about a notetaking system called the "slip-box method", or "Zettelkasten" (it's German). I'm thinking about lot the information that we come across in life, how I've been managing it, and how I may want to tweak or further define those practices. Some of those tweaks may have implications to this blog.  
  
For example, I've been **tagging** these posts all wrong. My entire approach to tagging was backwards. Tagging and sorting are not the same thing. I read [a wonderful article](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/) about why tagging against a topic is ultimately much less useful than tagging against and object. The Labels (Bloggers nomenclature for tags) I've been applying to these posts have been woefully broad. They don't really help you pull together related material. Case in point, "thoughts" is one of them. Why would a Column ever NOT be tagged with "thoughts"? What good does clicking "thoughts" do? I don't think I'm going to change my ways for the purposes of this blog, but it influenced my notetaking system greatly.  
  
This post has been roughly 30 days coming, and originally I was going to write about the differences between Data and Information, and Information and Knowledge. I was going to do some sweet Venn Diagramming of my previously-existing systems and how they map to those concepts... but that became a whole thing of its own and frankly I'd rather keep this shortish. I'm announcing here the formulation of my new **2nd** webpage:  
[http://www.gillespedia.com](http://www.gillespedia.com/)  
  
The purpose of Gillespedia is distinct from the Column in two main ways.  
1\. The Column is very much about and relating to me and my life. Gillespedia (despite the name) will have nothing to do with me as a person.  
2\. The Column is somewhat meant to function as a time capsule/journal/whatever. These posts are fleeting. Their content is ephemeral. I see Gillespedia entries as being timeless.  
  
Gillespedia will be where I put content like my "Counting and Math" post from a while back. The whole "I'm thinking about writing a book" might just be this instead. Who knows. The future is full of possibilities (and burritos, but that's a different story).  
  
[Here's some slides I made in PowerPoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pWfrcA0jKlIBByCJbpY1j4%5FHioboghN6/view?usp=sharing). If you don't prefer to link out to Google Drive, here's some screenshots that may or may not be legible.

Immediately after finishing that PowerPoint (literally that same day) I discovered the notetaking/wiki-making/workspacing application "[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)", and it threw everything up in the air again. It's freaking sweet and I could write an entire Blog about it and how it could be the future of everything. Literally I've thought about moving everything in there, from my Life Tracker to this Blog. Gillespedia content right now lives inside of notion.   
  
I probably will write about it. But now now. Now bed.  
  
Top 5: Things I Thought about All Month  
5\. Gillespedia, and what I want to do with it.  
4\. My continued frustration with Google for their scatterbrained approach to things. Google Assistant's "to do" list exists separately from Google Keep's to-do possibilities, which exists separately from Google Tasks.  
3\. Notetaking (especially Markdown) and to-do applications, along with Knowledge Management Systems. Literally looked into SlackEdit, Simple Markdown Editor, Bear, Todoist, Things 3, Evernote, Trello, Notion, Outlook, Google Tasks, Google Keep, Google Calendar, IFTTT, and a couple of other applications.  
2\. Expanding and improving my Life Tracking System to include information from If This Then That (which I am taking much better advantage of now).  
1\. "Getting Things Done" by David Allen. I read it. It's good. I also read "The Power of Habit" and "Bored and Brilliant" and started a couple other books I wound up returning to the library after a couple hours.

Motto: These Mottos Do Not Accurately Reflect Anyone's Actual Motto

  
Now that January has almost passed, let me tell you about my present plan for the future. This is about to get _meta,_ folks.

  
At the beginning of each month, I plan on writing a column that both summarizes the previous month's 30 day challenge and announces the next one. In a few days, expect to see a post titled "Paleo is so last month" or something similarly childish. That post will be a subjective reflection upon my 30 Day Paleo Challenge coupled with an objective analysis of how it affected the data I record in my Life Tracking System. I plan on doing these analyses at or around the 1st of every month this year, summarizing the challenges Melissa and I are embarking on.  
  
The Column is essentially becoming a very real part of the whole 30 Day Challenge project. It will be where I draw my official conclusions regarding the previous month's challenge; and it will be where I officially decide and announce my challenge for the next month.   
  
Expect charts and figures.  
  
Speaking of charts, here's a chart of the Column post frequency since the inception of the Blogger column format:  
  
  
[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--0hOsjdsrfM/UuLFfS0usNI/AAAAAAABHZE/JQAr5mTbdAQ/s1600/%2523137+-+Column+Post+History.PNG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--0hOsjdsrfM/UuLFfS0usNI/AAAAAAABHZE/JQAr5mTbdAQ/s1600/%2523137+-+Column+Post+History.PNG)

  
I made one post in March 2012.  
  
Two posts in April 2012.  
  
Then I posted very consistently, with a couple of months of one-post-per-week sprinkled in there from time-to-time.  
  
At the end of last year, there were a couple of months that I didn't write much.  
  
Interesting. I couldn't tell you why. Luckily I'm not obligated to do so.  

  
Top 5: Big Changes Coming Up (from far-away to coming soon)

5\. I'm going to be married  
4\. I'm going to switch roles within my current job - everything about what I do each day will be different  
3\. I am going to move into Mission  
2\. I am going to move out of Missouri, which I'm very excited about  
1\. I am going to start a new 30 Day Challenge

Motto: So Much to Do and so Little Time

  
Writing Columns is something I do for fun. Unfortunately, there isn't much time left for fun in my days lately. Dear reader(s) please forgive me for what will be a relatively quiet month here on this blog... for I have entered attack mode.  
  
[![](assets/166-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kl4o9Fs2WQ8/U08W-kJY3wI/AAAAAAABLyI/A66AjHBmtsE/s1600/%23166+-+attack-knob.jpg)

I am calling it "attack mode" because framing it that way is better for morale than framing it as "Wake up. Prepare for work. Work on work stuff. Lunch (during which I usually work). Work on work stuff. Go home. Cook. Work on administrative stuff. Eat. Work on wedding stuff. Sleep. Repeat... sometimes adding in a trip to the gym." Attack Mode sounds much better. As a policy, I don't talk about work on the Column. For the purposes of this post it will suffice just to say that I come home at the end of the day stressed out, which is new. Wedding work is killer, but at least I'm motivated. I'm still angry that there isn't a platform that truly fits my notetaking & project planning/implementation needs, but I've made Google Drive work pretty well so far. Microsoft OneNote would have been alright, but that's not what we used. Partially because the experience has historically sucked outside of the native windows client... and I don't want to develop any more dependencies on using Windows as my OS. Evernote was close, but still lacks some really fundamentally important features. No spreadsheets? Seriously? I'm not going to write out my own CSV file on a rich text editor. I've thought about the problem of notetaking and project management suites time and time again. I know and have tried all of the major players. What's frustrating is that every solution has \~6 of my 10 requirements for the perfect notetaking/project tracking suite. They are all great in their own ways, but then fail in some vital areas. For the picture to go out on, I made this chart (on my Chromebook):  
  
[![](assets/166-2.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wt%5FPgPnPlAg/U08cAdHSGpI/AAAAAAABLyY/ePKGOAl9qZs/s1600/Screenshot+2014-04-16+at+5.09.28+PM.png)

  
You could argue for and against a lot of the checkmarks I left off there and put on there, respectively... but I'll stand by my chart.

  
Top 10: Requirements of the Perfect Notetaking/Project Tracking Suite

10\. Linkable notebooks, both from within and without. Related, the ability to have notes open to public view. 9\. No practical limits on storage or bandwidth. 8\. Scalability from tens of notes to thousands. 7\. Ubiquity from a 24 inch monitor to a 4 inch iPhone screen. Web and native clients across all major platforms with feature parity. 6\. Individual and collaborative use with a clear delineation between the two. Both experiences should be consistent with one another and work together intelligently. 5\. Timeline and gallery views. Timeline should incorporate filters and different views. See notes by date created. See notes by custom date field. See only a specific set of notes (say, notes tagged as "event" or something). Gallery view shows the photos and the related metadata (similar to a Pinterest interface). 4\. Calendar & email integration 3\. Customizable, searchable, sortable metadata fields with optional addition of tags for each entry. 2\. Entries of various type - including formatted text, spreadsheets, pictures, audio, and video, at a minimum. 1\. The ability to create password-protected, securely encrypted notes on a note-by-note basis.

In [Column #97](http://www.aarongilly.com/97) I wrote about "The Taxonomy of Human Attractiveness". In that post, I analyzed the perceived differences between "cute", "pretty", "hot", and "beautiful". Today's post is a continued analysis on human attractiveness, but more focused on _what_ it is and less focused on our _nomenclature for_ it. I started writing today's post back in November of 2016... so this has been a long time coming. Since this is already a Column out of time, I'm going to correct my accidental skipping of Column #344, too.  
  
Also I feel the need to through out a necessary PREFACE CAVEAT!  
  
I'm an American white male. I'm a member of just about every majority class that exists in my region. Attractiveness is heavily influenced by culture. Everything I'm about to say is coming from a place of "I Googled this", but my Google searches, even in Incognito Mode, will inherently be geared towards the American majority sentiment. Societal commentary is not a goal of this particular topic, but I wanted to throw this paragraph in to cover my bases.  
  
Secondary preface: This entire post is about physical attractiveness, and is about as deep as anyone who would care to read this much about physical attractiveness.

## Human Attractiveness!

"Attractive" (_adjective) -_ providing pleasure or delight, especially in appearance or manner; pleasing; charming; alluring. (thank you [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/attractiveness)

  
Defining "attractive" is surprisingly difficult without the help of reference materials. It's tempting to just say "[you know it when you see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%5Fknow%5Fit%5Fwhen%5FI%5Fsee%5Fit)"... but when you do see "it", _**what** are you actually seeing?_ That's the question I want to answer first. Then I will attempt to answer **why** those things are "attractive".

  
The traits of human attractiveness can be broken down into two distinct categories: those which depend on gender, and those which do not. Certain traits are only attractive on a guy (e.g. thickness & evenness of beard). Other traits are only attractive on a girl (e.g. wide hips). Some things, though, are 100% universally considered attractive. I'm going to call those the "ungendered" traits - despite Chrome telling me that's not a word.

### Ungendered Traits

#### Symmetry

Symmetry of the body and symmetry of the face are two, independent traits that both weigh in heavily on an individual's level of physical attractiveness. Typically, we associate a high amount of symmetry with beauty.

  
With regard to the **face**, we look for eye placement & size, nose structure, jawline, cheekbones, hairline, eyebrows, lips, and to some extent the ears. You can see how symmetric your own face is by taking a straight-on photo and mirroring each half of your face - like so:

  
[![](assets/344-1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HRD2kib0bIQ/VgV4PGnMMAI/AAAAAAAB-F8/HpizppmANM4/s1600/%2523265%2B-%2BFacial%2BSymmetry.jpg)

  
Ideally, all three faces up above should look basically the exact same. Differences between the three indicate differences between the two halves of the face. I, for example, have a fair amount of difference between the three photos. I'm not terribly asymmetric, but definitely not perfect.

  
**A quick word of caution:**

If you do this **you may learn some things about yourself that you didn't want to know**. For example - it turns out the right side of my face (the "me" on the left side of the picture is my right side) is much better all around than my left side. "Right Aaron" has a more square jawline, a less obviously broken at one point nose, less tired eye shape, and a couple of other "better than" traits that I'll leave as an exercise for the reader.

  
With regard to the **body**, symmetry about the left and right halves plays a bit smaller role. Basic symmetry is probably good enough. Small differences between the halves of the body likely go unnoticed, but large may still be apparent. If you are wanting to examine your left/right bodily symmetry, you can do the same procedure as I suggested with the face. I'll save you from my picture and leave you with my conclusion: my left half is significantly more muscular than my left. I don't know why. They lift the same amounts of weight. Basically left half Aaron body + right half Aaron face is the way to go.

  
Bodily symmetry exists also between the proportions of the limbs, length of the torso to the legs, length of the arms to the legs, et cetera. This type of symmetry is harder to measure - preferences vary from person to person. We'll get into that more later.

#### Ungendered Traits Not Related to Symmetry

I'm going to be honest here, this part of my research was boring. So here it is in short:

  
Has anyone ever told you "you look young for your age"? That's a compliment (assuming "your age" is 18+). Youthfulness is an attractive thing! Doesn't matter which gender, on the whole people are attracted to people who appear younger than they actually are... with some exceptions (the "silver fox" comes to mind). Another thing people tend to find attractive is smooth, even skin. Skin blotches mar the canvas that is your body.

  
Physical fitness plays a huge role in physical attraction. While many can argue the ethical ramifications of the "average" person's desire to have a physically fit mate, it's an undeniable fact that most humans express a preference for a mate who is physically fit. The definition of physical fitness is somewhat vague, and what traits of physical fitness are particularly attractive might vary from one person to another. In general, though, a low to medium-low level of body fat is typically desirable in modern times. This hasn't always been the case, but today we prefer folks with flat stomachs and at least a moderate level of muscle tone. I'll get into physical fitness more later.

  
Arguably this next part is deals with symmetry... forgive me.

  
Another thing you might have been told "you're average-looking". If you have - that's _also_ a compliment! Turns out looking "average" is pretty darn good looking. Here's an "average" group of faces from different countries:

  
[![](assets/344-2.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wSnp4xOY5TQ/WCqDlKUVE4I/AAAAAAACf%5Fk/SQ0Kw8QmxYwu03HmQye551tcEk6fMG61wCLcB/s1600/%2523302%2B-%2BBeauty.png)

  
That's 30 good-looking people.

  
It kind of makes sense, right? For any given trait, "average" is a very safe way to go. It reduces the size of the huge nose. Lack of exaggeration can be a good thing. It makes a dainty girl nose bigger on your friends boyfriend. It takes any distractingly-different-from-normal trait and throws it out the window. 

  
Of course, as a 6'9" guy, that stings a bit.

  
More interesting than ungendered traits, are the things that differ between the sexes. The phrase describing the different physical attributes between genders is "sexual dimorphism". Sexual dimorphism is (at least partially) related to how much testosterone/estrogen an individual produced during their pubescent developmental stage. That's why it's easier to tell apart men and women than it is boys and girls.

### Attractive Male Traits

#### Face Stuff

In researching this topic for the Column, my main goal was to find out which person I could point to that most perfectly exemplifies a "male" face... but before I get to that let's talk about what typically makes a face "dude-like" (to use the technical term).

  
Dude-like faces usually have:

* Broader forehead
* Larger chin
* More prominent brow
* Bigger nose
* Some cool facial hair that I can't grow
* \- and -
* Are "taller" or "longer"
* Are more "square"

Googling "[Hyper-masculine face](https://www.google.com/search?q=hyper-masculine+face)" pulls up pictures mostly of Javier Bardem, which I don't disagree with. Looking at this dude, there's not a single iota of me that say "wait, you're a guy, right?".

[![](assets/344-3.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KfefcK77Jes/W5QBzVz1saI/AAAAAAADSDE/lOmiiaQoquwn4t%5FxPNJZwnG%5FYJgXWVGkACLcBGAs/s1600/man%2Bface.jpg)

#### Not Face Stuff

I think it's a well-known trope that an "hourglass figure' is a desirable female trait... BUT have you heard of the male counterpart - the Martini Glass?

  
[![](assets/344-4.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9o12Zz4BSNw/WC9ifcjYfqI/AAAAAAACgdw/AHLwd-L81XoaVTcftOtj5F4w%5F4cE%5FgO%5FgCLcB/s1600/%2523302%2B-%2BMartini%2BGlass.png)

  
That's one handsome/kinda creepy looking dude. It's also very "bro". That dude skips leg day.

### Attractive Female Traits

#### Face Stuff

The characteristics of an attractive female face are essentially the antithesis of those which I listed for men. The standard list of feminine facial features include:  
  
* Smaller jaw
* Petite nose
* Big eyes
* High cheek bones
* Shorter faces

Googling Hyper Feminine Face pulls up Natalie Portman, Miranda Kerr, and Scarlett Johansson. I thought of Ana De Armas from Blade Runner: 2049:

  
[![](assets/344-5.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FjyRzWtf5WA/W5QpCZigx2I/AAAAAAADSDQ/lxaQ-6-MfTgwmkt2F0TVdaBqUawmJdTsACLcBGAs/s1600/Lady%2BFace.jpeg)

  
Again, it's hard to look at that photo and say "throw a mustache on that person and she'd be a pretty convincing dude". There's just no way.

#### Non Face Stuff

There's a host of well-documented features that make a woman attractive. Just listen to any given song on the radio and there's a 30% chance you'll hear some subset of the list below.

* Wide hips
* Narrow waist
* Full breasts
* Long legs
* Apple bottom jeans
* Boots with the fir

Since symmetry is a theme in this Column and I showed a Martini Glass figure up above... here's a picture of an hourglass.  
  
[![](assets/344-6.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a9SpeZxG5pM/W5SaZKNlFmI/AAAAAAADSG0/5MrJkWc99zsg3NL4Q4SJ2KF8h4O-UpRyQCLcBGAs/s1600/tube..jpg)

  
Apparently women are supposed to look like a tube.  
  
I feel weird writing all these things. I'm going to leave it at that for now and get to the part of the Column I've actually been looking _forward_ to writing...

### WHY!

What is attraction? Why does it exist? What does it all mean, Basil?

  
Well. Biology roughly says that life is the process of RNA replicating itself. The better it is at creating individuals that live to breading age and produce children that themselves do the same, the more likely it is to continue being. Some deeply-seeded animalistic instinct in each of us knows that, on the whole the fittest possible mate produces the fittest possible children. If our RNA, which is inherently selfish, wishes to continue existing beyond us, it must find another individual whose DNA creates RNA that creates proteins and whatnot in orders that help our potential offspring to go on and replicate that process.  
  
That process roughly translates to us going around, looking for tall, dark, and handsome men and/or girls with little waistlines and full buttocks... but why? Some lizard brain part of each of us has decided that low body fat is a sign of healthiness, and a huge dose of testosterone or estrogen during puberty is a good thing, for some reason. I'm not sure that I'd believe larger-than-average doses of either of the sex hormones is exclusively a good thing in terms of health.  
  
It's all about biology, baby.  
  
Alright I'm going to exercise...this Column... from my backlog.

Motto: Person aaron = new Person("Aaron",26,80,227);

  
This post was written more because I had the opportunity and less because I actually had something to say. So, there's that.

  
Somewhere around a month ago I started up a Google Hangout with my cousins and the Best Man from my wedding. We've had this awesome running group conversation ever since. When Google+ became a thing I imagined that it was going to change everything. As it turned out, that never really happened (I don't really use _any_ social networks any more). This group Hangout conversation feels like what you'd want from a "Social Network". It's a platform on which we can talk among ourselves, share pictures, and do whatever else we feel like.

  
The best Social Network is one that is constructed in the most similar fashion to regular social behavior. I want to talk to person A, person B, and person C. So I have a conversation with them. I don't have to write on person A's wall and tag persons B and C. I don't have to post a status update tagging all three people. I just do the thing that I want to do with a minimal amount of extra added junk.

  
Good on you, Google.

  
Come to think of it, "Good on you, Google" could pretty much be the name of this Blog.

  
Oooo I'm going to get meta for a second:

  
Here's an explicitly defined naming convention for everything you see here. This is _a Column_. It is a particular instance (post) of _"The Column"_ which is a subset of the list things I'd ideally like to have on this _Blog_. 

  
What I'd LIKE to have is a Blog (website) that contains:

A - The Column (a list of individual Columns)

B - Videos (a section showing different videos I've made)

C - Features (a list of Columns that were "Feature" posts)

D - Projects (any content that I made specifically for projects, separated by project)

E - About (where I talk about who I am, what I do, and what all this is)

F - Miscellany (whatever else I feel like)

  
If I ever do get around to fulfilling the "make the Column a more legitimate thing" goal, it will probably look something like that. It may or may not be named "WVZ7X7". I like the whole "get results ONLY about me using 6 characters" thing, but I suppose "aarongilly" does just as well. I've done some loose mock ups of what the site would look like and how it would be architected, but I've got better things to do with my time.  
  
Speaking of which, I gotta go. Gotta lift weights. Eat lunch. Get groceries. Learn some more Java. Do the weekly deep clean of the place.  
  
The picture to go out on - ~~here's my wife using her hair as a~~ ~~mustache~~ here's a 6 second mockup of the website:

Look at how thorough and detailed it is.

  
Top 5: Goals for Next Week

5\. Reach Lesson 9 on the Java Udacity Course, I want to get back onto the Android track.  
4\. Work out the 4 times I promised myself I'd always work out.

Motto: My Grass is Blue

  
This is going to be a fairly short post. From last Wednesday to last Sunday Melissa and I attended the 43rd Walnut Valley Bluegrass Festival. Here are some reflections from my mini-vacation.  
  
The environment at Winfield is a completely unique and an absolute joy. Nowhere else would you ever find such a large, dense grouping of nice, accepting, and perhaps most of all talented people.  
  
Everyone camps at these festivals. The campgrounds are full up with tents, RVs, campers, bivvies, you name it. Melissa and I got to try out our new camping gear, which we were impressed with.  
  
Bluegrass attracts a wider variety of people than you'd expect. I learned this my first time at Winfield. I relearned it my second time.  
  
I cannot play music on anything. The older I get the more I resent that fact about myself. Melissa is trying to remedy this, but it's a slow process because I'm stubborn and particularly "average" in that area.  
  
Weaving between campsites as you walk from one corner of the fairgrounds is an experience like none other. You'll never be completely out of earshot from some pack of people somewhere playing live music. When you find one song fading away you'll find another one from another group is taking its place.  
  
Carp camp is huge. And fun.  
  
To say Colby camp is good is to say that I am kind of above average in height.  
  
Speaking of height, walking around heavily populated areas with an obvious and non-taboo physical anomaly gets old pretty fast. I've gotten used to it, but my cohorts were consistently crabby about the constant commentary of the casually camping concertgoers.  
  
The "no alcohol allowed" rule is observed with about the same frequency as the speed limit on any remote highway.

  
It's good times.

  
Here's a photo!

I'm helpful!

  
Top 5: Memories from Winfield

5\. Walking around a pitch black Pecan Grove.  
4\. The nap I took in the camper.  
3\. Watching Melissa's friends' group play on the big stage.  
2\. Seeing Melissa's other friends all night on the last night.  
1\. SPANK IT! The Carp Camp classic cheer.

Motto: Opinions! They're like facts, but so messy!  
  
I write these posts in random order. Sometimes I start on the body. Sometimes not. Today this is the last paragraph I'm writing. I didn't mean to write this whole thing tonight, but I did. Whoops.  
  
Apple's developer's conference was today. They announced some new stuff as per usual. Some of it is pretty neat. Some of it is not that exciting. All of it is overpriced. It got me thinking, though. They updated their notetaking application to work in new ways with the "Apple Pencil", which made me wonder to myself how many people are going to change their notetaking workflows to accommodate this new feature? Beyond just this feature, how many people are going to change the whole way they've been doing stuff just to accommodate these various new devices?  
  
Then I got to thinking about the concept of "systems" as a general topic. It seems like it's not a good idea to rely on your "system" for doing things to be overly dependent upon others... especially others who aren't incentivized solely by maintaining you as a customer. Apple is an easy target for this. They aren't in the business of making an iPhone that you can buy once, develop your habits and daily life around, and leave those habits unchanged for the next 10 years. You're constantly being pushed into the next way of doing things, all in the name of "progress!" But that progress comes with a feeling of losing all the progress you made before it. Sure it's a fresh start, but you're constantly burning a bit of the bridge you just crossed. Apple is in the business of selling products. They aren't necessarily in the business of doing exactly what's best or most efficient for _you_.  
  
Have you ever heard the term "high-concept"? For example, "that movie was so high-concept, I'm not sure I'll ever wrap my head around it". I've heard this term a decent amount, and I've never once heard it used correctly. Even I don't use it correctly. I didn't use it correctly in the example I just gave. For some stupid reason, "high-concept" means "(especially in a movie or television plot) emphasis on a striking and easily communicable idea", basically just the opposite of what it sounds like. I'm sure there's some logical reason the person who coined this term with a seemingly backwards definition, but rather than invest the effort to understand why, I will choose to say that person is an idiot.  
[The definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=high+concept) I got straight from Google's Knowledge graph, by the way.  
  
Have you ever heard the term "paper weight"? Not the single word "paperweight" as in "the iPhone I dropped is now just a $700 paperweight", but instead in the two word phrase referring to the _weight_ of paper - as in "this is a 32lb off-white A4 sheet of paper". It turns out paper's "weight" literally refers to the mass of a standard amount of paper. didn't appreciate the difference between heavy and light paper until I got a new notebook at work that's 28 pound paper. Writing on that feels like etching on stone with a lightsaber. It's truly opened my eyes to how crappy writing in a notebook with standard 20 pound paper is. Each page is truly a blank slate. Turning the pages doesn't feel like turning a piece of limp cloth. It feels like you've just completed something important, archived it to a permanent location, and begun anew with a blank white canvas. Every single page turn is like fresh snowfall to play in. It's so good.  
  
I was going to move on, but i just thought of another metaphor for the paper weight thing - it's like getting the iPhone 4, the first one with a "retina display", then trying to go back to your old iPhone 3G with the crazy low pixel density. You immediately realize what you've been missing, adapt to the new baseline, and hate everything you've dealt with up until that point for being inferior. I'm having a similar experience with my Chromebook at the moment because I saw a Chromebook Plus in person.  
  
AND STILL I CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT PAPER WEIGHTS with my picture to go out on. This is from [an Amazon review I just posted](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TBCV9W590VZQ/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fgetr%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBDN14K), lamenting my recent purchase of the Leuchtturm 1917 notebook I bought recently.

Top 10: Podcasts I Recommend  
10\. [Nerdist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-nerdist/id355187485?mt=2) \- Chris Hardwick talks with celebrities. This used to be higher up the list, but the lately the podcasts have just been audio versions of his AMC show "Talking with Chris Hardwick"... which doesn't have the same vibe.  
9\. [Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) \- Dan Carlin's one-man show in which he talks at staggering length about historical events. His show on The First World War was nearly 24 hours long. This podcast is particularly well-suited for road trips. He's an amazing story-teller.  
8\. [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) \- Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich's heavily produced show dealing with a wide-array of topics. Radiolab is a lot like This American Life, but it trends more towards sciencey things, and employs more noticeable editing style. This is the first podcast that I managed to listen to every episode of.  
7\. [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) \- Ira Glass's weekly podcast/radio show is, for many, the baseline against which all other podcasts are compared. There have been some great episodes and some not great episodes. On the whole it is worth the subscription.  
6\. [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/) \- Steven Dubner explores "the hidden side of everything". It's a well-produced, mentally engaging podcast that talks about all sorts of things. I listened to the most recent "How Stupid is Our Obsession with our Lawns" while I was cooling off, post-mow. I hate mowing. I don't like lawns. I was on board before the opening theme played.  
5\. [Do Go On](https://www.planetbcasting.com/our-shows/do-go-on/) \- Dave, Matt, and Jess take turns presenting reports on various topics from the hat. This is currently my 2nd favorite podcast, as it combines things I like from #7, #2, and #1 from this Top 10\. It's listed at #5 cause I haven't been listening to it long enough to justify putting it any higher. It's been steadily moving up the list.  
4\. [Serial ](https://serialpodcast.org/)\- Sarah Koenig, originally from This American Life, tackles stories that are too big for a single, hour-long episode. Season 1 of Serial is a must-listen.   
3\. [This Week in Google](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google) \- Leo Laporte talks each with with Jeff, Stacy, and usually some tech journalist guest host about the most recent happenings in the realm of technology, the cloud, and, from time to time, Google.  
2\. [Good Job, Brain!](http://www.goodjobbrain.com/) \- Karen, Colin, Dana, and Chris are friends who do pub trivia. This podcast is them quizzing each other, pub trivia-style, on topics according to whatever the theme is that week. I like the trivia. I like the hosts. Solid recommendation to everyone.   
1\. [The Weekly Planet](https://www.planetbcasting.com/our-shows/the-weekly-planet/) \- James and Mason talk about comic books, movies, and whatever else they feel like. Listening to these two Austrailian dudes talk about the news, the most recent big movie, and what they're reading/what they're gunna read makes each Monday morning a highlight of my week, which is tough to do. This is without a doubt my top recommendation.

# Motto: A Tool is Only as Useful as Its Operator's Ability to Use It

This column was co-written with the intelligence column I just posted. The two go hand-in-hand and very well could have been combined.  The first paragraph from my post on intelligence may have sounded impressive to some. Just for reference:
Today's post is an article on acumen and aptitude. A blurb on brains and brilliance. A commentary on capacity and comprehension. A discourse on discernment and deciphering. An item on intelligence and intellect. A piece on perception and precocity. A story on smarts and savvy. A write-up on wit and wisdom.
Impressive?  What if I showed you [this](http://thesaurus.com/browse/article) and [this](http://thesaurus.com/browse/intelligence)?  Just because I used internet resources to help me build out that paragraph, does that take away from it? Did I not still write it? I think a huge portion of being smart is just knowing what tools are available and how to use them. I think a huge part of being successful is just *doing* so.  Being an engineer and coming from the son of a long line of carpenters, I like tools. Tools perform functions. Functions are useful. I like useful things.

I have written at length on several occasions about my Every Day Carry (EDC) on this blog. I have went camping twice since my last EDC writeup and I've done a lot of thinking (and buying... much to Melissa's chagrin) and I've decided it's time to update my (new) EDC.

Pockets:

![](assets/99-1.jpg)

1. Nexus 4 - Took all these pictures using it and my tripod mount
2. Sog Flash 2 - Legal carry in this area& it looks more like a pen than a knife in your pocket
3. D-Ring with my apartment keys - usually attached to #5
4. Money clip/wallet - small enough to carry in my front pocket
5. KU Lanyard with my work and car keys, also my keychain Leatherman

Bag(s):

![](assets/99-2.jpg)

Option 1: Maxpedition Sitka - better for outdoors/rural carry
Option 2: Timbuk 2 Messenger, Small - better for the city

Tech Stuff:

![](assets/99-3.jpg)

1. USB wall outlet
2. USB car outlet
3. USB thumb drive - Kingston, 16gb
4. Small cinch bag for #5
5. Nexus 4 headphones
6. USB adapter (to connect #8 to #3... or a keyboard)
7. New Trent mobile charger w/ laser pointer & flashlight - Charges the tablet and/or phone a few times over per cycle
8. Nexus 7 - probably still the best tablet for the money you can buy
9. Case Logic sleeve - I used to do the kind of case you had to open, but came to prefer a sleeve
10. Micro USB cable - for every phone that isn't Apple based
11. Mini USB cable - for my GoPro & whatever else

Pen-related items:

![](assets/99-4.jpg)

1. Moleskine - For doodles and thoughts, goes with the 4 pens
2. Post its - You always need to be able to leave notes
3. Streamlight Flashlight - I get a lot of compliments on this thing. I use it all the time
4. Sharpie - Always handy
5. Stanley Pocket Screwdriver - Not for any heavy duty work, but works in a pinch 
6. Paper Mate Flair Pen - I switch between these and Pilot G2's and they are both fantastic

The rest of it:

![](assets/99-5.jpg)

1. Handkerchief - for cleaning things other than noses
2. Leatherman Wingman - cheap but good!
3. Altoids go kit - Band aid, Q-tips, tweezers, finger nail clippers, Chap Stick, tooth pick things
4. Paracord - cause you never know what you need it for, you just always need it
5. Portable kleenex - for cleaning noses
6. Portable toothbrush & toothpaste

Optional Add-On - GoPro:

![](assets/99-6.jpg)

Example loadout unpacked and packed up & waterproof.
I went on a float trip/campout recently, as I just wrote about in the last column. During this trip I was impressed with a something I saw. Two of my fellow floaters had a waterproof tote containing all the things you need for a successful camp. I was very impressed. I made a list of things I'd put in mine.

What that translates to is "I made a list of things that I will put in mine someday".

I want to say more about tools. But this post has taken ABSOLUTELY FOREVER TO WRITE.

I wanted to push this column out the door before I wrote about Melissa's return. Also, I wanted the last 10 days or so to be post #100.


# Top 5: Most Useful Tools
5. Flashlight
4. Knife/Multitool
3. Smartphone
2. Google (really, the internet)
1. Your body and mind

# Motto: Bwhaaaaaaaaaam

About the motto - I'm watching Inception. So you might have to take this entire post with a grain of salt. 

Maybe a brick of salt.

I have had a surge of productive energy since the end of school. Something about not having homework. Not having homework assignments gnawing at the back of my mind. Not having a cosntant study monkey on my back. Not having any of those things really puts me in a different mindset. Before, free time was spent "actively relaxing", if such a thing exists. Now that there is no homework. I am doing things with my free time. All those things I wished I had time for during school.

I did some research about cell phone companies. Verizon is killing the unlimited data. The grandfathered in plans from older Verizon contracts. From even older Alltel contracts. I found out that pre-paid phone plans exist right now that offer unlimited text, talk, and data for $50/month... and you can bring in any unlocked GSM phone you want. That means, the unlocked Galaxy Nexus that Google is offering from their Play Store for $400 and pay $50/month for as long or as short as you want. That is much cheaper than the $200 subsidized version at Verizon with $100/month plans. It pays for itself after 4 months of usage and then saves you $50 for every year thereafter.

The other thing I wanted to talk about briefly was my recent Zen moment with Google Plus. The number of friends I have now that actively use Google Plus is growing. It has become a more legitimate option as time has passed and I will continue to back it fully. It truly is what sharing online SHOULD be like. Facebook is mindless chatter. Google Plus is full of things I actually care about. 

Last two things:
1. I just finished Inception. I now fully subscribe to the interpretation that he was asleep still.
2. My new phone background (thanks to my lovely girlfriend) is AWESOME:

![background](assets/6-1.jpg)

The avengers was AWESOME.

# Top 5: True realizations I had during my Zen moment
5. All of the content I see on Google+ is relevant. I care about everything I see because everything I see was intended for me to look at. This is a stark contrast to Twitter and Facebook where every post is meant for everyone (for the most part). I feel sharing on those networks is like trying to shout something in a loud concert hall. most of what you see wasn't really meant for you.
4. The messenger app for Android and iPhone does have a purpose. When trying to organize a group meetup, there really is no smarter way to do it. I want to use and explore this feature more- but I really love the idea. Google+ is way more than just a social network. They came late to the game and had a few misses along the way, but they really knocked it out of the park when they got it right.
3. Sharing exactly what you want with exactly who you want to share it with is a much better system than Twitter and Facebook's approach. Seriously. Much much better. Having said that, "Public" posts are important every once in a while. People think Google+ isn't used because the selective share feature works so well.
2. The integration with Android is really remarkable. Android has passed the iPhone in terms of successfully integrating a cohesive system (this is beyond Google+, but it is what made me fully realize it)
1. Google+ hangouts are fun. They go beyond "Skyping" and can be used for a lot more than video calls. Google Docs editing. Youtube watch parties. Group hangouts. Screen sharing. All of which can be accomplished from any Android/iPhone. Hangouts are a feature I have explored way too little.

Motto: The Adventure Begins...  
  
Here's some notes-to-self from my Google Keep that I originally wrote with the intention of exploring at a greater length on here, but given that I write about this sort of crap all the time, I'm just going to write them verbatim from my notes:  
  
Always explore. Always try new things.  
  
Happiness is not that hard.  
Happiness follows healthiness. You feel healthy when you're exercising regularly, brushing your teeth, cooking nutritious meals and eating them, sleeping enough, and working on creating projects that hone talents and stimulate the brain.  
Happiness also follows a sense of control. You don't feel in control when you're giving into your "immediate gratification" impulses.   
  
Splitting your attention between things is a fleeting contentment that ultimately givesway to a sense of existential dread. It's always better to be fully into doing one thing than to be halfway doing two things.

 Okay that's done. Next up.  
  
I just found out I was born in the Chinese year of the Dragon. That's cool. Dragons are cool. Mythical creatures are cool. Refrigerators are cool, on the inside. I like the idea of folklore involving mythical creatures. Something about it I find very charming.  
  
Jessica Jones season 2 was okay. Jessica Jones season 1 is probably right behind The Punisher as my favorite of the Netflix Marvel series. Actually let's make this official:  
  
Aaron's official ranking of the Marvel Netflix series:  
1\. The Punisher  
2\. Jessica Jones S1  
3\. Daredevil S1  
4\. The Defenders  
5\. Luke Cage  
6\. Daredevil S2  
7\. Jessica Jones S2  
8\. Iron Fist, featuring Danny Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, Protector of K'un Lun and Sworn Enemy of The Hand

That's how you pack.  
  
Top 5: Only Rules You Need to Play 8 Ball Billiards (a.k.a. "Regular Pool")  
5\. Players take turns shooting their balls (solids or stripes) until all their balls are pocketed; they then win the game by pocketing the 8 ball. Pocketing the 8 ball with any of their balls still on the table or pocketing any ball (or committing a foul) in the same shot as the 8 ball is pocketed is a loss.  
4\. All shots must be called by indicating which ball will go into which pocket (with no need for further specificity). This includes (but is not limited to) the 8 ball shot.   
3\. Your turn continues until you fail to make the shot you called or commit a foul.   
2\. Fouls include causing a ball to go off the table, not making contact with your ball first, failing to drive any ball into a pocket or a rail, or pocketing the cue ball.  
1\. All fouls result in ball-in-hand.

Motto: IN AND OUT  
  
This is going to be a super quick update before the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. midseason finale. I'm very excited for that.  
  
I'm very excited about everything right now. I'm really happy about my recent transition. Things are going better than I could have expected.   
  
I took part in a friend's biannual family Christmas bash last weekend. It was also great. It's so cool they do that. I aspire to be that cool.  
  
Weirdly almost every single card in my wallet is changing all at once for different reasons. My ID will stay the same... but that's about it. It's weird that several things that almost never change are all changing simultaneously for different reasons.

Motto: Free the Beast  
  
I want to write a book.   
  
I don't to write a book so that I can "I'm a guy who's written a book", but because I have something have I wanted to create since 2011, right before I graduated college. I've have vague and specific ideas about this thing I want to write. 8 years ago I started a Word doc to get some thoughts down. I've sat down many evenings since then and added to it. Right now it's a 57 pages... of mostly just outlines for content to come.  
  
The struggle I'm having is how to describe what I want the book to be.  
  
I want to write a study guide for every test I've ever taken.   
I want to make a reference book that also teaches fundamental concepts.   
I want to explain the concepts I learned in school how I wish they'd have been explained to me.  
I want to be funny.  
I want to be serious.  
I want to have something to give my son that teaches him what I've learned over the past 30 years.  
  
I want to cover everything I've learned that has subsequently proven to be important to me. All the general knowledge that a functioning member of society would normally be expected to know. I want to cover the basics of English and History. Then, everything I ever learned in math, chemistry, physics, and engineering. I want to explain the difficult concepts each in the most simple way possible. I want to have consistent formatting and notations.  
  
This is me telling you that, sometime soon, I'm going to start working sections of this book into the Column. Why not kill two birds with one stone? Also, some of my more astute readers can tell me that "Fourier" does not equal "Foray" and that I'm the smartest idiot they know... or maybe the dumbest smart person.  
  
I haven't yet figured out how I want to weave this stuff into the Column. Maybe they'll just be the body of the post. Maybe they'll be posts all to themselves. Maybe they'll just be indented, like this:  

> The alphabet is 26 letters in a specific order:
> 
> | Upper Case | A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z |
> | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
> | Lower Case | a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z |
> 
> In the table above the black letters are consonants. The blue letters are vowels. The letter "y" is weird. Some people will say it's a consonant sometimes, but just consider "y" as a regular vowel and you'll be fine. Letters in certain orders make words. All words have vowels in them. Most words have consonants, but not all words. Not all combinations of letters make words. Example:
> 
> | **Word** | **Not a word** |
> | -------- | -------------- |
> | Trumpet  | Grupelash      |
> 
> Letters are the most basic building block of the English language. They make sounds. Some can make only one sound, some can make many different sounds, and some can make no sound at all sometimes. English is weird like that. Letters don’t really matter in spoken language. In spoken language the most basic building block is the _phoneme_, which is the smallest unit of sound we use. Sometimes phonemes and letters correspond one-to-one, like in the word "cat", which has three letters, and three distinct sounds – the hard "c", the short "a", and the hard "t". Other times you get words like "through", which is 7 letters long but really only has 3 phonemes ("th", "r", and "oo"). Phonemes aren't something people think about much, but the difference between phonemes and letters make learning to read and spelling both difficult sometimes. It's just how it is.

  
Or maybe I'll insert them as a picture:

Captain Marvel was good, by the way. Not great. Just good.  
  
Top 5: Self-Actualization Things I'd Love to Do if I had Infinite Time  
5\. Take online courses in math, science, and engineering to further my skillsets.  
4\. Workout 5 days a week. Meal prep well-balanced meals utilizing whole foods in accordance with a coordinated plan to achieve ultimate Aaron health & physique.  
3\. Learn to play piano. And guitar.  
2\. Create a videogame from scratch. I'd probably make a Metroidvania because they are fun to play and sound fun to build. Also probably just because I like Hollow Knight so much.  
1\. Writing the book I wrote about in the body of this post.

Motto: Two Kinds of Nerdy Will Battle in This Post

  
I realized the other day that the Disney company is _killing it_ in terms of content - _especially_ content in which I am personally interested. Disney owns:

  
* ESPN
* Marvel
* Pixar
* Lucasfilms
* ABC
* The Muppets
* and let's not forget their own movie production studio, which has been turning out classic movies like crazy for the past 60+ years
  
So basically, all of the MCU, Star Wars, all the kids movies that adults also like, all the shows on TV I actually watch, Kermit the Frog, and pretty much all of sports.

  
Disney is amazing. I never really realized it.

  
Thus ends my short little spiel about my new-found appreciation for Disney as a company.

  
_first segway._  

  
I've had my Moto 360 for 3 months now. I think that's a long enough time to do a revisit review of Moto 360 and Android Wear. Here's my one-word review:

  
_'salright._  
  
It's alright. It's not great. It's not bad. It's just alright.  
  
**The Good:**  
  
* It looks fantastic. It's not "too big" at _all_. It's sleek. It's beautiful.
* Notifications on the wrist are much nicer than you'd expect.
* The ability to do a quick "text my wife I'm coming home from work" without pulling my phone from my pocket. This has been super nice to use on occasion. Also, quick fact-checking Google searches are handy.
* Music control without picking up my phone. This is GREAT when working out, driving, or if your phone is in a bag or something.

**The Meh:**

* The pedometer. I definitely don't trust it step-for-step, but it generally reflects my relative level of activity.
* The battery. It lasts a full day without fail... but definitely no longer. Not a big deal unless you forget to bring your charger on an overnight trip.

**The Bad:**

* The heart rate monitor. The heart rate readings are spotty at best. Sometimes the readings are great, sometimes they are half or double what your heart rate actually is, but more often than not it just doesn't find a reading at all. If you move at all or are sweaty in any way you _will not_ get a reading... and that's when you'd _want_ one. So that's dumb.
* The heart rate monitor. It's on here twice because this is an entirely separate issue. If I want access to my heart rate data I have to tell the thing to take readings manually. So it's not useful as a quantified-self tool. It DOES take your pulse every 5 minutes on its own thanks to some Motorola Software... but they have elected NOT TO GIVE US ACCESS TO THAT DATA. That makes me so angry. It's there. They have it. They won't give it up. They are taking the readings then hiding the results behind terrible and obscure presentation methods. It's just a huge wasted opportunity.
* There are certain times when having duplicated notification buzzes gets overwhelming. If you're concentrating on something and both your phone and wrist start lighting up like crazy... it's distracting. If you want to let a call ring through and go to voicemail, you have to silence both your wrist and your phone separately (or live with the ringing & buzzing simultaneously).
  
_second segway._

  
I just watched The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies. I will write a long, ranty review of it for my next post (where I will re-visit my hatred for "part" movies). Directly after the movie, though, I found out the guy who plays the leader of the elves is also in Guardians of the Galaxy... and I was inspired to do this Top 5.

  
Top 5: Actors in Both Marvel Movies and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth

5\. Lee Pace as Ronan The Accuser and Thranduil

# Random Little Things I've Wanted to Write About for a While

## Pronunciation & Parts-of-Speech

The word "**niche**" is pronounced differently depending on which part of speech it being used as. I don't know if this is a local phenomenon or not, but "niche" sometimes rhymes with "itch" and sometimes rhymes with "leash". 

A product that serves a very specific need is a niche (rhymes with "leash") product.  
If you like that product, it's your niche (rhymes with "itch").

For a few weeks this was the only example of part-of-speech-dependent-pronunciations I could think of... until last night. 

It's a good practice to use citations, you should always attribute (at-TRIB-ute) your source. conscientious people like to give credit where credit's due - and conscientiousness is a good attribute (ATT-rib-ute).

## English is Dumb  

The above example is just one of a million little dumb things that "you just have to know" about English. It's truly a nonsensical language. A famous example: ["Fish" is spelled "Ghoti"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti). 

If I were to construct a language ([which is a fool's errand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), it would be an [atonal language](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_language) with unique symbols for each [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme). Google tells me there's somewhere between 40 and 45 phonemes in English. Memorizing 45 letters would be easier than memorizing 26 different letters, most of which have multiple different forms/pronunciations. Moreover, my "letters" would all fit in the same basic shape, a square. It would be something like this:

![dumb idea](assets/397-1.png)

Then you could fit letters inside of neat rows and columns, you would always know exactly how to pronounce every word, even if you didn't know what it meant. Sounding it out.

## Salary Milestones

I made this thing. Wanted to share it here.

- $12,400 - you enter into the 10% tax bracket
- $12,760 - the poverty line for an individual
- $15,080 - Federal minimum wage, $7.25
- $20,800 - $10/hour
- $21,900 - you enter into the 12% tax bracket
- $26,200 - the poverty line for a family of 4
- $41,600 - $20/hour
- $51,675 - you enter into the 22% tax bracket
- $62,400 - $30/hour
- $83,200 - $40/hour
- $96,400 - you enter into the 24% tax bracket
- $104,000 - $50/hour
- $124,800 - $1/minute (or $60/hour, if you prefer)
- $145,600 - $70/hour
- $166,500 - $80/hour
- $172,925 - you enter into the 32% tax bracket
- $187,200 - $90/hour
- $208,000 - $100/hour
- $219,750 - you enter into the 35% tax bracket
- ...many more $10/hour incremental jumps...
- $525,600 - $1 every minute, working or not, awake or not
- $530,800 - you enter into the highest tax bracket, 37% (at $255/hour)

Basically, if you're not making $450 every night in your sleep, you don't have to worry about the highest tax bracket.

Note: the salary associated with each hourly pay rate is for 52 forty hour weeks.
Note 2: the tax brackets here are for 2020 and assume no deductions, which is a bad way to do this, but it's a bit cleaner than the alternatives. 

### Not in that List  
Not shown in that list, because it's personal to each of us, are the following two salary milestones:

1. "enough" - the point at which your salary affords you the lifestyle you want. This is an important point. Once you hit this, any work you do beyond this you'd better be doing for fun. 
2. "rich" - basically, whatever you're making plus just a *little bit more*. Nobody ever thinks they are rich.

Note: see also my [Income Tax Overview Gillespedia article](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/income-tax/) for more on taxes.

## How much is an hour of my time worth?  
I got this technique from Daniel Levitin's "[The Organized Mind](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313653/the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j-levitin/)".

**Pro Tip**: in order to make some decisions easier, calculate the value of your time. Ask yourself, how much if an hour of my time worth? If someone asked me to do a menial (note: not particularly terrible, nor particularly fun) task for an hour... how much would they have to give you to make it "worth your time"?

Figure that out. Once you know how much money you’d be willing to lose to gain an hour, you can apply that knowledge in a few different decision-making scenarios:

### Should I do this myself or pay someone to do it?
Simple formula:

A - Best guess, how many hours will it take you?
B - Best guess, how much will someone charge you to do it for you?
C - How much an hour of your time is worth.

**A x B > C** → hire someone  

**A x B < C** → do it yourself

This is all affected by the fudge factor of how unpleasant you find the task. If I valued my time at $25/hour, that doesn't mean I wouldn't pay somebody $100 to be tortured for 2 hours. Nor would I pay someone $2 to hang out with my friends and drink beer. I can handle that task. Use this technique when you're truly on the fence.

### Should I Buy the Thing?
Simple formula:

A - Cost of the thing
B - How much an hour of your time is worth.

Calculate how many hours of your life that thing costs (we'll call this "X"). If you wouldn't be willing to stand in a line for X hours to get the thing for free, don't buy it. I haven't read Henry David Thoreau's "Walden", but supposedly he talks about this a lot in there.

Another fudge factor: the costs of ownership and maintenance. Add those costs (in terms of dollars and hours) to the price of the thing. You'd be surprised after doing this little exercise how much of the crap you buy is actually "worth it".

## Five Minutes: Expectations vs Reality  
There's a huge chasm between what "feels like" it takes 5 minutes to do vs what *actually* takes 5 minutes to do.

### What "Feels Like" 5 Minutes
Because of some personal flaw, I will *never* learn that each of these things takes longer than 5 minutes.

- Taking a shower
- Getting dressed and getting your shoes on
- Making breakfast
- Eating, in general

All of those may seem like "morning routine" things, and that's true because I thought of this after I realized it takes me a full 30 minutes to do a lot of individual things in my morning routine. I suck at getting through a productive morning with any amount of expediency.

### What Actually Takes 5 Minutes
Each of these things *feels* like it takes a lot longer than 5 minutes... but I've timed each of them. Each took fewer than 5 minutes and 1 second to accomplish.

- Decluttering an average room
- Wiping down counters & the sink
- Doing the dishes (notice a theme here?)

Motto: The Times, They are a Changing

  
September 2012 I started my first real job. I entered into an engineering technical development rotation program. For the past year and a half, I've driven around inspecting telecommunications equipment in offices scattered throughout the Midwest. I enjoyed the work. I enjoyed the work - and I was good at it. I gained a high level understand of what makes our cell phones and the internet tick. I learned how a data center should look, and how it shouldn't. I learned a lot and had the pleasure of working with a ton of great people. It was my first real job and I'll always remember it fondly.

  
The thing about rotation programs is this: your job is to change jobs. Monday morning that's exactly what I did. I woke up this morning with my game face on.

I rotated into a new job role, in a new city (sort of). While I can't say exactly what the challenges I will be facing are, I can say they will be infinitely different from those that I'm used to. It's going to be a wild and crazy ride.

  
And I'm ready for it.

  
Top 5: Internet memes I'm going to use to apply to my new rotation

5\. Yo dawg, I heard you like jobs, so we put different jobs in your job so you can do jobs while you're doing your job!  
4\. Alright, let's do this. LEEROY JENKINS!  
3\. I can has new leadership roles? (I hate this meme)  
2\. Such new position. Much responsibility. Wow.  

1\. I apologize for this entire Top 5.

# Motto: I Hate Writing about Writing. This Motto is Writing about Writing about Writing. Metametawriting.

So, those of you who come here often will notice it looks different... again. This is slightly more in-line with what I had in mind. It's still not perfect, but it's closer.

What I envision is less a "Blog" and more a multifaceted website, complete with many different sections (one of which would be a Blog).

Up above you'll find the Title of the page has been changed from "The Column" to "WVZ7X7". This is likely temporary. I am experimenting with the notion of "The Column" just being a portion of a larger entity, "WVZ7X7", which would also be home to videos, pictures, files, special articles, and other things of the sort. As you can see, I have already arranged spaces for Videos and Projects. The Videos page is built out, the Projects page is basically just a picture right now.

MetametametametaCommunitymetametametalmetamorphasismetamuscalmetaguyonlineheseemslegitnotlikeallthoseotherguyswhojustwantedtousememetametameta

I'm bound by the format of the Column to put a picture somewhere around here, so here's that picture, without any context:

Motto: What's Left to Write? (this is a very similar pun to the one I made [4 Columns ago](http://www.aarongilly.com/282), sorry)  
  
I'm writing this from a hotel in St. Louis. Melissa and I are here for the weekend for the 2016 Regional American Music Therapy Conference and as an excuse to sit around all day an avoid responsibilities (fun game: guess which one of us is here for what!). We plan on seeing the sites (sights?), enjoying nice meals, and, in celebration of the start of our re-watch of Parks and Recreation: treating yo self.  
  
  
[![](assets/286-1.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F0tDUv4-HO0/Vwgv2U-4UfI/AAAAAAACJvo/pmIikeyFd7MrY8GgIwT9FklahHaV7EhVA/s1600/%2523286%2B-%2BTreat%2BYo%2BSelf.jpg)

  
That introductory paragraph was the _only_ thing I wrote in St. Louis. I'm already back home. In the time it took you to look at that picture and move onto this sentence, I went to the St. Louis Museum, St. Louis Zoo, the mall, fell asleep, and drove 4 hours back home. I'm quick.  
  
One of the main things I wanted to write about today was my 12 New Year's Resolutions (which, you may remember, are what I'm doing instead of 30 Day Challenges for this year).  
  
By the end of the year - I want to...  
**Weigh 240** \- this is still very possible, but despite my honest efforts I have changed my weight from 226 to 227\. That's 100% within my daily weight fluctuation. So. No change.  
  
**Bench 240** \- I've gone from \~200 to 205\. Sadly, this is still 20 pounds down from a couple years back. I'm behind.  
  
**Squat 315** \- I've gone from \~240 to \~260... maybe more if I had a spotter/confidence.  
  
**Deadlift 345** \- I've gone from 280ish to 315... which technically is what I deadlift a few months back. This time I didn't have the benefit of a belt.  
  
**Incorporate 3 Miles Runs into My Workout Routine** \- not even close. Zero improvement.  
  
**Macro Ratio: Fats & Protein Up, Carbs Down** \- FINALLY SUCCESS. I've had \~1% change in the appropriate direction for each.  
  
**Track 80%** \- another success. I'm at 90% for the year.  
  
**Booze, Soda, and Energy Drinks Only Once per Month** \- other than the inclusion of "vacations", this goal is still going very well. St. Louis was a mini vacation.  
  
**Slowly Build Savings** \- meh. Minor success. Vacations have and will continue to eat into that.  
  
**Go Out of the Contiguous 48 States** \- I think Melissa and I are likely to go on a cruise with a stop in the Bahamas. That counts.  
  
**Read 12 Books** \- I'm 2 1/2 books down 4 1/2 months into the year. Not on track.  
  
**Screen Time Trending Toward One Hour** \- while my average screen time is down 40 minutes/day... it's got another 100 minutes to go.  
  
Top 5: Comedic Performances by Traditionally Serious Actors  
5\. Honestly, I only had four in mind. Google tells me I should probably put Jeff Bridges in "The Big Lebowski", but honestly "The Dude" wasn't really what made me laugh the hardest in that movie. Maybe John Goodman? But he's done a fair amount of comedy. Anyway, let's move on.  
4\. Tom Cruise in "Tropic Thunder"  
3\. John Cena in "Trainwreck"  
2\. Jason Statham in "Spy"  
1\. Michael Shannon in "The Night Before" - this was my inspiration to do this Top 5, it was so fantastic

Motto: Now I'm thinki0 0ng with Portals.

So. It's been a week since my last post. Why the semi-unusually long break between posts?  
  
That's what happens when I accidentally reset my entire computing architecture to zero then spend all my spare time learning how to operate on Linux, learning what's possible, and making myself a new computer home. My old laptop, running a new OS, is now capable of video editing, photo editing, Android development, media streaming/backup, and videogaming. I set up those 5 things over the past 7 days. They are all free; and they all work just fine. In fact, I'm much more fond of my computer now than I was about 10 days ago when it ran the Windows setup I'd built out over the past 8 years.  
  
I realized I'm not going to miss Windows 7\.   
  
I _also_ realized that my Playstation 3 is entirely unnecessary.   
  
My laptop is very much capable of playing games. Steam is cool. Games are easier to get, cheaper, and everything runs off a common platform. I was able to get Portal 1 up and running without much/any hassle. Portal is a ridiculously fun game that everyone should play. It's funny, smart, and incredibly unique. Just watch this:  
  
  
I played through Portal 2 something like 2 years ago. Loved it. Wanted to play Portal 1, but it was a computer-only game. So, when I had access to a computer-based gaming system it was naturally my first choice. Portal came out in 2008 and I just played through it. There's a very very relevant XKCD for this situation:

So, back to my point, I do not play videogames often enough any more to really justify the Playstation. So, if anyone is looking to buy a PS3\. I guess I'm selling.

Top 5: Things You Could Do This Weekend with Your Computer and Zero Dollars

Motto: Tonight's a Twofer

  
I have a theory about stress, not all types of stress, but certainly some times. The basic premise of my theory is this: The human body seeks a certain level of stress and will adapt itself to find and maintain that level. The overall amount of stress or adversity you'll face in life is, for the most part, fixed and out of your control. Here's a made up example: Let's say you workout at the gym for an hour and a half total each week. For that hour and a half, you are bringing on all sorts of physical stress and hardship - but for the rest of the week you are able to do most things without any difficulty. Compare that to a person who _never_ goes to the gym. They don't have any major spikes in their level of physical stress. I believe this person will come to find that little things like carrying groceries or getting out of bed will become more and more taxing as time goes on. Let's compare those two in a hypothetical graph form:   

[![](assets/210-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwJyqMr78jE/VDdGRD5xWDI/AAAAAAABeq8/5zUYEP3Vfz8/s1600/IMG%5F20141009%5F153435~2.jpg)

  
Obviously I put a lot of work into that. The overall amount of stress is represented by the total area under each line. If I drew it right, my theory states that the total amount of ink to fill the area under the orange line should be basically the same as what it would take to fill in the area under the purple line, the two possibilities yield equal amounts of stress. The person who works out, though, is much less stressed for the vast majority of the week. That's the person I want to be. That's the person I think I am.

  
Guess what: I just taught you about integrals and you didn't even know it. Those are those fancy math symbols:

  
[![](assets/210-2.gif)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJ-A2EYo3hk/VDdIaKuB8oI/AAAAAAABerI/2B7T4qnBAVs/s1600/%23210%2B-%2BIntegral.jpg)

  
HA! You learned some calculus and you didn't even know it.

  
Anyway, that's my theory. It's just a theory. I think it could probably be extended to other things, but I'm not going to belabor the point. 

  
I wrote this whole post basically in conjunction with my previous post (about my desire for some sort of Life Reference Guide). I split them up because I felt like it.

  
Top 5: Other Things to Which My Theory Might Apply

5\. Learning - for every question you learn the answer to, you realize that the answer brings with it another question.  
4\. Money - either take the stress of making and keeping a budget or take the stress of having no more money.  
3\. Thrill - people who go out seeking thrills all the time might become numb to them, whereas people who don't seek thrills might be really wowed by how fast their toaster toasts.  
2\. Studying & Schoolwork - either take the continual small stress of studying a little bit every night a few weeks before the exam or take the single massive stress of pulling an all-nighter.  
1\. General happiness - the prince has a palace and servant to wait on him hand and foot, but has the weight of the kingdom on his shoulders and doesn't appreciate the service; meanwhile the pauper has no servants, but doesn't have to worry about the entire kingdom.

Note from the Future: I've decided to remove my kid's personal info from this post

As a Father: THE THERMOSTAT IS NOT TO BE TOUCHED  

I recently became a dad.

It feels weird to say "I became a dad", because it feels weird to be a dad. The whole thing feels weird. Weird and good. My son is the first baby I've spent more than 5 minutes around. The first baby that I've held while he cried. The first baby I've soothed. The first baby whose diaper I've changed. The only baby I've ever wanted to hold.

I always wanted a kid because I have some romantic feelings about life and love and purpose and our biological imperatives and existence and stuff... but it turns out that having a kid also comes with some other neat things. The prospect of getting to shape an entire person as he grows up is really exciting. I really look forward to each of his individual stages of development. I can't wait for it to have "all gone too fast", as they say. I want to see this little dude thru it all, teach him about what's right and wrong, tell him all the best jokes, and ways to do stuff. I want to see him learn math, and have to tell him "I don't know, just because that's the way it is" during his "why" phase. I look forward to the "pick up your toys" phase. I can't wait to stomp him in videogames, then slowly start to lose to him.

Life is a matter of balance. Balance, addition, and subtraction. I added a LOT to life in the past 2 weeks, and naturally that means I'll have to subtract some other things. Hopefully I can have some hand in the picking and choosing about what parts of my old life I jettison to make room for the new. I'm sure it won't be exactly what I would have picked, but I'm also sure it won't be exactly what I wouldn't have. And I'm sure it will all have been worth it.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Motto: I Might Be Inclined

  
Melissa and I are back from vacation. It was great.  
  
I'm sitting at the table. It's late at night. Melissa is grading. The cats are sleeping on their tree. The place is freshly cleaned. The temperature is just right. I've got no need to wake up early tomorrow. I've done lots of work on projects today. I've had a lot of time to relax. Everything is perfect.  
  
Okay it just got a bit too hot.  
  
RUINED!  
  
Last month's 30 Day Challenge was to "**Work out before work. Take lunch to work.**" How successful was I?  
  
In a word: Somewhat.  
  
I worked out before work about half the time. I brought lunch to work probably only 3 days a week. On those occasions where I failed, I did find myself at the gym later that day more often than usual. The net effect was I exercised 53% of the days of April. Compare this to my average of 31% and it's a noteworthy accomplishment. Still it falls short of the 73% that truly "every day" would have given me.   
  
Half success!  
  
**Age of Ultron** was great. I have no idea why it's not higher on [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers%5Fage%5Fof%5Fultron/). Maybe it was the Bruce Banner/Black Widow love story. Aside from that story arc (which was still pretty alright), rest of the movie was fantastic.  
  
Finished my second Udacity online course towards the "Front-End Web Developer" nanodegree. Again, I'm not currently _paying_ for these courses. I won't get any official "credit" or "degree", but I _am_ getting the same knowledge - which is all I really care about. I have learned some HTML and Git version control. Soon: JavaScript. I'll use what I learn to accomplish hopefully a few things:  
  
* Create a new "The Column" _not_ hosted on Blogger
   * New feature: continually updated pages (in addition to typical posts)
   * New feature: public project repository
   * New feature: adaptive design
* Create a new "Life Tracker" _not_ hosted on Google Spreadsheets
   * New feature: support for multiple users & incomplete data sets
   * New feature: including location data & other new data points
   * New feature: including data pulled from the internets
* Other stuff.
  
Community is a severely underrated show. It's in a very elite tier of television shows in my mind.

Motto: I'm Here to Make a Bargain

  
I have had a lot on my mind lately. An almost inexplicably large amount for a person whose so far into the steady-state portion of his life. I'm grown up. I'm out of college. I have a job, a wife, a house. I could justifiably continue doing exactly what I'm doing right now for the next 35 years and nobody would bat an eye.   
  
Maybe the fact that there aren't foreboding changes coming in the future is what's on my mind. Maybe the fact that there actually **is** a huge, foreboding change coming at some point (but not within the next 9 months to a year). Maybe that's on my mind.  
  
 My dad is a the best dad. He's there when you need him. He knows how to do stuff, and knows how to show you. He's smart, but also wise. Other kids' dads may have taken them to soccer practice, my dad was the coach. Other kids may have _watched_ their little league games, mine was the organizer, coach, and sometimes even the pitcher. My dad got married young, has stayed married for over 38 years, built a house, had three kids, raised all three of them to be successful adults, and did so without sacrificing character. When I was a kid, there was always a going to be a roof over my head and meat on the table. It's my ambition to be that kind of dad.  
  
Dad taught me how to install a new outlet in my garage, helped me hang up this new light:

He also helped me pick out which tools to prioritize in my budding workshop... and dremel out ridges onto that Captain America shield. I take full credit for the leather backing - but that could also be why it wants to fall off...

My mom was just as great - I just can't articulate it as easily due to my solitary X chromosome. I'm just not thinking about what it's going to be like to be a mother someday... so she doesn't get the shoutout she deserves.  
  
 I have been watching Black Mirror on Netflix. That show is the kind of show you watch slowly, with a fair amount of "sink in" and "come out of it" time between each episode. The episodes of the show that I've seen have been 50% great, but 100% incredible. Even the ones that aren't a wholly original concept... for example the opener of [season 3 "Nosedive"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R32qWdOWrTo) is remarkably similar in concept to [a Community episode featuring an app called MeowMeowBeenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI4kiPaKfAE).  
  
Speaking of things I watched recently...  
  
The DOCTOR is in... and he's STRANGE. Marvel's "Doctor Strange" came out this weekend. I caught it opening night. I really enjoyed the movie. It was not a let down, but was also not anything like the awesomeness that was Civil War. I reserve the right to withhold further criticisms/compliments about the movie until I watch it a second time. There is a LOT going on and I feel like I definitely missed a fair amount in my first go-round.  
  
I bought a book. The Swoly Bible by Dom Mazzetti. It did this to me:

Motto: Owed In Son

Today is Monday. Today is not Sunday. I didn't get my workouts done consistently last week. I'm going to lift as soon as I post this. This post is going to be short. I'm mostly writing it to get the video that I made specifically for this post online. I like it. It's 30 seconds I cut together of the disc golf I played with cousin Jon.  
  
Thor: The Dark World comes out in a little under four weeks. It's the last time we'll see Loki, as far as we know. Loki isn't going to be in The Avengers 2 (Age of Ultron).  
  
Speaking of the Avengers: Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on TV. It's pretty cheesy. It seems like it's supposed to appeal to a more general public than comic book nerds. Either way, I'm recording it every week (thanks to Google Fiber).  
  
In other news - the Nexus 5 comes out in... ugh. They still haven't announced that one. I'm very upset about it...

Random thought -  
  
It seems like nobody on Saturday Night Live has been there for more than 2 years. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one.  
  
  
I'm going to embed a photosphere I made right before Melissa's first concert as a full blown picture, then embed that video I referred to earlier.  
  
That looks surprisingly bad. The actual photosphere doesn't have a black circle at the top and bottom; yet the embedded one seems to distort the image to force in the black circles. That's disappointing.

Motto: 7 Days (equals one week!)

  
I've been married for nearly a month. So, I'm an expert, yes?

  
You know what the weirdest part about being married for me has been? Not calling Melissa my "wife", not saying that we are a "family", not having in-laws, not living together, not any of that stuff.  
  
Wearing a ring.   
  
Wearing a ring has been the weirdest part about being married for me.  
  
I've known Melissa and I were going to spend our lives together for well over a year now. With that knowledge came the knowledge that we'd be functioning as a family unit. I've gotten to know her family really well over the past almost 5 years. I like them. I've liked them for a long time. I'm way more comfortable around her brothers than I would be around other kids their age. Same goes for her sister... and parents. They are good people and I've felt accepted by them for some time now. Living together doesn't feel that new. We've lived in the same building basically since we met. We were Resident Assistants in the same dormitory for 2 years. When we _did_ move out of the same building, we were \~100 yards from each other.  
  
But wearing a ring... that's new to me.  
  
I don't want to come across as pessimistic or in anyway unromantic about the huge, grand, gigantic, gynormous life step Melissa and I just took together. I write about the ring because that's so much easier to put into words and I'm just incredibly lazy.  
  
As a matter of fact, it would be easier just to show you the thing than to keep talking about it.

Top 5: Things You Can Use a Ring for (Other than Indicator of Marital Status)

3\. Spin it on a tabletop to amuse yourself an annoy everyone around you!

Motto: The Star-Spangled Man with a Plan
  
  
On Thursday, April 3rd Melissa and I watched a double-feature: Captain America: The First Avenger & Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It was the first time I've ever watched a double feature like that, it was basically 5 straight hours of awesomeness. This was us the entire time:   

[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xRGvNGD_bWg/Uz4BTEN5QYI/AAAAAAABLHI/yvpAcclZl_g/s1600/14+-+1)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xRGvNGD%5FbWg/Uz4BTEN5QYI/AAAAAAABLHI/yvpAcclZl%5Fg/s1600/14+-+1)

I don't know how exactly we watched the movie on the evening of the 3rd when it was scheduled to open on the 4th... but I don't care. I SAW IT. Now, before I go on - I want to give you this: FAIR WARNING: I AM WRITING THIS COLUMN ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER. THIS POST WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS OUT THE WAZOO. So, don't read this if you haven't already seen Captain America.   

[![](assets/162-1.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z6RqAEt3HIE/U0Fypy-%5FYiI/AAAAAAABLSU/45gCyJOVlVI/s1600/%23162+-+Captain+America+SHIELD.jpg)

 SECOND FAIR WARNING: I AM WRITING A POST ABOUT A COMIC BOOK MOVIE ABOUT A 95 YEAR OLD MAN WHO THROWS A SHIELD AROUND LIKE A BOOMERANG WHILE WEARING THE LEATHER EQUIVALENT OF A UNITED STATES FLAG UNITARD. So, you might not care to read this if you are a souless scrooge & probably a operative of HYDRA. If either of those are the case, watch this and tell me it's not the greatest thing ever: I accept your apology. On to my actual feelings about the movie: IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS GRAND. IT WAS WONDERFUL. And I'm not being sarcastic. The Winter Solider isn't a "superhero movie". Marvel doesn't make movies in just the superhero genre. They make superhero movies in whatever genre makes sense to the story. The Incredible Hulk was a monster movie. The first Thor movie was a fantasy. Captain America one was a period piece, a war movie. The Winter Soldier is no different. It's a spy movie/political thriller... one that involves superheroes. That's the best kind of one. It ties into many topical themes/hot button issues: drone warfare, ubiquitous surveillance, preemptive strikes, a centralized superpower to police the world. All of those are huge in the movie and very present-day. Beneath that, though, the movie ties into several deeper, human themes: trust, righteousness, ethics, morality, authority. That's what the story is really about, and that's timeless. Oh, and on top of all of those things: a guy with a metal arm slapping people around and tearing apart cars. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is possibly misnamed. The main villain of the movie is _not_ the Winter Soldier. The man they call The Winter Soldier is really more like a weapon that the actual bad guy uses. The name sets up a mostly false expectation. I'm not going to say it's a _bad_ name, though. I think that Bucky Barnes' character is going to be big, and this movie will be known for his introduction just as much as it will be known for the disassembly of S.H.I.E.L.D. and, to an extent, HYDRA. In the long run, it was a good name choice. Also, naming it "Captain America: S.H.I.E.L.D. is No Longer" would probably have spoiled the movie for everyone.

  
I'm going to make an aside right here. Let me talk about spoilers for a couple of seconds:

  
I'm tired of spoilers. I was on Reddit reading about the TV show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." and some rouge commenter said "Quiksilver and the Scarlet Witch are in the post-credits scene of Captain America". I read it, and before I comprehended what it was, I was spoilerized. You can't un-read something. I was much less excited to see the two future Avengers on screen than I would have been if I hadn't known it was coming. 

  
Movie previews are giving away too much of the story. The preview I posted above shows an injured Nick Fury telling Cap that he's in charge. When I watched the movie, Nick Fury was injured. I thought "oh, this must be why he was hurt in the trailer". Then, when he "died", I thought "well he's obviously not dead, he hasn't told Captain America he's in charge yet. I would have enjoyed the movie better if I'd never seen the trailer.

  
The Amazing Spiderman 2 is the worst example of spoilers in the trailer that I've ever seen. There's 65 different trailers, all showing different parts of the movie. I sincerely hope that they've done some master craftmanship and that the trailers haven't given away the entire movie, but I feel like that's kind of a long shot at this point. I could recut their 66 different trailers and put together the whole movie.

  
(They made a new trailer while I was writing that paragraph. That's why the number went up.)

  
Anyway, back to the topic at hand: The Winter Soldier was a fantastic movie.

  
How does TWS affect the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe?

* S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded. Or, at least it's giving the impression of disbandment.
* HYDRA is alive! But then they were destroyed again. But then they weren't.
* Dr. Stephen Strange was mentioned off-handedly. Does this mean we should expect a Dr. Strange movie in Phase 3? I'd guess yes, but all it _really_ confirms is that he exists in the MCU.
* What's going to happen to the TV "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."? They've already got this planned out, but I'm _really_ curious to see how they deal with the show's namesake being relegated to the past tense.
* Future big bad, Baron Von Strucker was unveiled.
* HYDRA is shown to be in possession of Loki's scepter. Their references to how important it is makes me believe that the blue stone in the middle really _was_ the Mind Gem (one of the 6 Infinity Gems that will become all-important in The Avengers 3).
* The Future Avengers Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch were _also_ unveiled... and we possibly got an answer to the "how did they get superpowers" question that gets raised when you learn that they can't legally be mutants, thanks to Fox owning the right to all of Marvel's mutants (the X-Men).

When I write about things that I'm really excited about I tend to go on forever. So I'll just summarize my feelings about TWS in one picture and call it the picture to go out on:

Motto: Sugar, Replaced by Spice, is not quite as Nice

  
Melissa and I have been living the Paleo life for the past 5 days. Originally, we decided we were going to keep a few things in our diets:

  
 \- Milk  
 \- Potatoes  
 \- Rice  
 \- Altoids  
  
After reading "[The Paleo Solution](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paleo-Solution-Original-Human/dp/0982565844/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389066497&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Paleo+Solution)" and "[The Paleo Diet](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paleo-Diet-Revised-Designed/dp/0470913029/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389066516&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Paleo+Diet)", we've decided to nix out a few more things from the diet. No more milk. No more potatoes. We are including rice because Melissa got a really nice rice cooker for Christmas and it's basically not an option to leave it in the box for a month. We are including Altoids because I like Altoids.  
  
So now, we are _not_ eating (among other things):  
  
 \- Milk, Cheese, Butter, Ice Cream, or Yogurt  
 \- Bread, Tortillas, Chips, Cereal, Corn, Oats, or anything with Wheat  
 \- Open your fridge and point at something... I can't eat that  
  
We picked up those two books from our local library. The local library is an amazing resource and nobody utilizes it as much as they should. Go to your local library and get something.  
  
Anyway, while reading the books it definitely felt like it was a bit _much_. I'm not sure I agree with everything I read, but I think a LOT of what I read was great and the advice spelled out in those books has lead to some very positive real-world changes. I'm definitely eating heartier and healthier and I think that it will carry over some after this challenge is done.  
  
One thing that came up over and over again in our reading was CrossFit. CrossFit is a workout/gym/business that has grown a lot in recent years. The exercise focuses on overall athleticism and general health (as compared to power lifting's focus on power and distance training's focus on the cardiovascular system). I like most of what I've seen/read about when it comes to CrossFit.  
  
Anyway, CrossFit and Paleo seem to be related. So Melissa suggests "let's try CrossFit for a month!" and promptly finds a really good deal on Groupon. Long story short, I just CrossFitted for the first time in my life. Melissa did too.

I know about as much about CrossFit as I do about Paleo, which is to say I don't know much; but I'm trying them out... if just for 30 days.  
  
This year is going to be interesting.

  
Top 5: 30 Day Challenges I've Decided to Do at Some Point

5\. Read 5 books  
4\. No screens after 9  
3\. Draw something every day  
2\. Work out every day (rotating through heavy lifts, cardio, yoga, sports, etc)  
1\. CrossFit should have been one, but Melissa decided we should tack it onto Paleo, because Paleo wasn't hard enough.

Motto: I Will Never Understand You. When Will I Stop Trying?  
  
311 is Melissa's favorite number because she likes (or liked?) the band "311". \#FunFactRightOutTheGate \#MisplacedHashtags  
  
It's rare that you know you're making a mistake while you're making it.   
  
Often times it takes _years_ to realize you probably shouldn't have done X or Y. You make a choice and take an action, see the consequence and immediately write it off as the only possible eventuality that could have occurred. You're a rational person. You made the choice. So it had to be a rational choice, right?  
  
You aren't perfect. You learn that growing up, time and time again. You look back at the choice you made and see where the path could have diverted. You could have gotten from there to here with less pain. You could have gotten to some other place that you'd rather be.   
  
It happens as you get older.  
First, you look back at yourself in elementary school or middle school and think "WHY!?"   
  
_Why were you so scared?_  
_Why didn't you make more friends?_  
  
Then, you look back on yourself in high school and think "DUDE!? WHY?!"  
  
_Why didn't you think about what you wanted to do when you grew up?_  
_Why did you hate how skinny you were, but do nothing to change it?_  
_Why didn't you go out and do more things with more people more often?_  
  
Later, you look back on yourself in college and think "IF ONLY".   
  
_If only I had been more outgoing._  
_If only I had studied something I enjoy doing in my free time._  
It's when you get to the next phase of your life that you can properly look at the rear view mirror and say "how did I get here anyway?". Then you look at all the things you've learned in that rear view and you use them to tell yourself "Now I've learned. Way back then I was a moronic kid. I'm older now. Now I know more. Now I'll won't make silly mistakes."  
  
What if you're in the longest phase of your life there will ever be? When do you look back? Surely you can't wait until retirement to realize what you should have been doing all along. I think that's what midlife crises are about.  
  
Lucky for me - I'm doing it faster. I'm doing it more often.  
  
I ordered too much pizza tonight. There's literally an entire large pizza sitting on the counter that I haven't even laid eyes on yet... and I'm full. I don't want it. I'd rather have my $7.99+tax back. But now I have to decide, do I eat more pizza than I really want to (a decision many people make wrong all the time), or do I put an entire large pizza in the fridge for leftovers? I'm on a plane tomorrow. Is there any chance I will eat an entire large pizza before I get on the plane? Is there any chance that eating a day-old, entire large pizza before getting on the plane is a good idea? No. So **why in the world did Aaron from an hour ago decide we needed it?**  
  
He was a moronic kid.   
I'm older now.  
Now I know more.  
Now I'll never make that silly mistake again.  
  
Lately I've noticed the cycle between "choice" and "regret" has shortened immensely. It is humbling to realize I am not, nor will I ever be, infallible.  
  
I'm still self-analyzing after 28 years... and don't reckon I'll ever stop. My tattoo means many things to me, I change the meaning depending on who's asking. It has roots in mathematics, religion, and history. It is an eye, which has a symbolism of its own, removed from the specific instance I have on me. I think, to me, most of all, it means "look into yourself."  
  
I'm struggling with one thing. that will be the thought I'll leave with, but first I want to wrap up the above.   
  
I haven't been perfect. I continue to fail on an almost daily basis. But overall, I've think I've done it. I haven't lived life free of regrets, surely; but for most of the things I expected I would regret, I really don't.  
  
Do I regret pouring so much of my energy and time into girlfriends I had growing up?  
I could have had so much more fun.  
I could have been worried so much less of the time if I were more care-free.  
... but if I hadn't made those choices, I wouldn't know what I liked in a partner. I wouldn't know what I _don't_ like. I wouldn't have the wife I have today, and I wouldn't have the life I have today. For those two facts, I wouldn't change a thing. It sucks that I had to go through years of growing pains, but the benefits were more than worth it.  
  
Do I regret trying the skateboard maneuver that broke my arm, Thanksgiving Day, 2001?  
I wouldn't have suffered.  
I wouldn't have missed my first season of organized basketball.  
...but I wouldn't have been able to pick myself up. I wouldn't have been able to push myself to go conquer the trick that put me in the hospital. I would not know what it's like to experience that level of acute pain.   
  
Do I regret developing some sort of autoimmune disorder? It's not a choice I made, but the same basic realizations hold true. I wasn't taking care of myself. I wasn't making good life choices with respect to food, sleep, and exercise. Obviously, given the pizza from before I'm still not perfect (the right amount of pizza is "none"). I struggle daily with symptoms... but the days without them are all the sweeter for it.  
  
That's not the struggle I wanted to leave off with. It's something I've thought about writing many times over, but I'm going to elect again today to not address that struggle.  
  
I struggle with the fact that some small choices, ones you've made hundreds of times over in the past with zero consequence, can be the ones that you come to truly regret.  
  
Who knew playing basketball in those shoes would cause me to lose a toenail? I've played basketball in new shoes before without problems. Who know that toenail would grow back with a mind of its own? Who knew I'd still have problems 290 days after making such an inconsequential-seeming decision?  
  
Who knew that trying to deadlift 345 would cause me to pull a muscle? I've pushed myself and set new PRs before. Who knew that the resting period from pulling that muscle would cause my back to flare up? Who knew that the return of constant pain after a long period free of symptoms would cause me to be so down? Who knew I'd still have problems 127 days later?   
  
What did I learn from those things? How do I know which of my next seemingly inconsequential decisions will be the one that does me meaningless harm?   
  
I'm struggling with the fact that big things have little beginnings.  
  
Writing accomplished. Now I'm contractually obligated with myself to have a picture in each post, so this is whatever photo I find that's convenient:

Motto: **"Motion Pictures" Don't Promise You Audio**  

  
Melissa was in Rhode Island last week. Last time she was gone [I wrote about how disappointed I was with my use of time](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2015/06/247-im-annoying.html). This time, I'm happy to report I did better. Get ready, I'm about to give you a listicle.  
  
**10 Things _You Won't Believe_ I Accomplished While Melissa was Out!:**  
  
I didn't shave. My facial hair was long before Melissa left, I decide to just let it keep going. It went pretty much as expected:

I worked out.  
  
  
I rewatched BoJack Horseman, season 1.

I got my 3rd Second-a-Day video caught up. I've only got 2 weeks left!

I rewatched Daredevil. Yes that's two whole seasons of shows in 2 weeks, but I was multitasking.

I hung out with the cats.  
  
  
I went and saw my sisters & nephews:

I missed Melissa - and dealt with being alone in very healthy ways!  
  
  
And, yes, worked on the Life Tracker. I've resolved to stop talking about it so much. So I'll compartmentalize this to the Top 5\. Feel free to skip that, if you want (and you may want to, it's filled with jargon).

Top 5: **Recent New Features to the Life Tracker**  
5\. Refactored the entire script to key off a single, awesome JavaScript Object instead of the two or three smaller Objects I was using.  
4\. As a consequence of #5, I have made it dead simple to add, remove, and rearrange Tracking Points. In less than a minute I was able to add a "day of week integer" (e.g. Monday = 1), useful for chart-building. Previously that would have been a massive, massive pain.  
3\. Simplified the custom views. Editing them is now possible entirely on spreadsheet instead of requiring code-level changes.  
2\. Sanitized user inputs & added API error handling. Necessary steps for eventual distribution.  
1\. Investigated (and likely discovered) methods for distributing The Life Tracker to other users in the future. This is my next "big" goal. I want to be able to link to a blank version of the Life Tracker and for people to be able to pick it up and run.

Motto: I don't know why she swallowed the fly  
  
I'm literally not talking about the widely-recognized abuse of words like "literally". This is less of a Buzzfeed Listical and more of a series of topics about which I have been contemplating (in the near past) that can be presented under a common theme.  
  
"Healthy" - without disease; promoting well-being  
That's the best definition I know. That is, notionally, what "healthy" is supposed to mean. Sometimes it gets used that way. I think, though, that a majority of cases in which I come across the word it means "please buy my product - don't fee guilty!" or "please buy in to my way of thinking about this". To me, healthy is having the physical and emotional capability to do the things you want to do, to accomplish things that are important to you - that which makes you fulfilled, and continue that capacity in the face of reasonable obstructions introduced by the world and the realities of everyday life. My definition of health underscores the importance of listening in the skillset of medical, therapeutic, and coaching professions. Now that I've written all this, I realize I'm just borrowing an idea from the "Toxic Rick" episode of Rick and Morty.  
  
"Addiction" - performing an action to avoid the negative effects of not doing so.  
The common connotation of "Addiction" is tin the realm of substance abuse. "Addiction" evokes an mage of chronic desperation to achieve a fix to the detriment of everything else in life. It seems to me that this is a perfectly valid definition in and of itself, but a strict interpretation of the definition would make the term applicable to a wide array of less desperate situations and circumstances. AN easy jump to make is to rewarming your morning coffee in a microwave after you failed to enjoy it while it was still warm and fresh. Nuked coffee blows. It's a well-known fact. It's not enjoyable, it's just tolerable; but you drink it anyway, even though you don't really actively want to, because you don't want to deal with the lack of your usual supply of caffeine. I think it further extends into the realm of falling back into some default behavior patterns long after they stopped providing fulfillment. There should be a word for more mild forms of addiction. I'm addicted to "Every Day Carry" culture, in this mild sense. In order to truly satiate the desire I'd need to spend a lot of money - so instead I partake of staving behaviors. I just read about various bags and watch review videos. I mildly enjoy the process, by it brings me no lasting fulfillment. That should have it's own word. It's not addiction. It's non-positive-propensity (work in progress).  
  
"Intelligence" - ......smarts?  
Honestly I'm not capable of coming up with a coherent and concise definition of "Intelligence" that isn't just a synonym. I'm not intelligent enough to be a dictionary - only enough to be a thesaurus. It's a common cliche to break the general term "Intelligence" into the more granular "book smarts" and "street smarts". While I generally agree this is a good direction to go, I hardly think splitting intelligence into two categories goes far enough to paint a full picture of an individual's level of intelligence. "Book smarts" breaks down further down into education, capability to understand complex systems or fields, and ability to absorb information through text/lecture. "Street smarts" breaks down further into experience, common sense, wit, and ability to absorb information through observation and by doing. The common threads of intelligence that don't fall neatly into exactly one of those two broad categories would include, aptitude, recall, ability to identify patterns, ability to identify trends, ability to make cross-cutting ties, critical thinking/reasoning, logic, bandwidth, ability to maintain focus/concentration, the ability to self-assess, imagination, capability of using tools/resources, ability to empathize, communication skills, and artistic ability. That list is not exhaustive nor are each of those concepts mutually orthogonal to all the others. They aren't separate dimensions. One aspect of intelligence I value highly (despite omitting it from my list) is the ability to problem solve, coupled with a natural desire to perform root cause analysis. Truthfully I could write for a LONG time about each of these concepts - but that's not a smart use of time.

Motto: "Miles Stone" would be a sweet secret agent name.

  
This is Column \#200\*. Because 200 is a round number in our base 10 counting system, this particular post number marks some sort of milestone. Note that if we were counting in base 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 this post would not be cause for celebration.

  
\*200 isn't the real "Column" count. It's the count since I started writing Columns again at the end of college. 

Some statistics:

  
\# of Columns: 200

\# of Days since Column #1: 906

\# Days/Column: 4.53

\# Columns/Day: 0.22075

\# Page Views (as of right now): 19,945

\# Page Views/Column: 99.725

\# Post Views on Most Popular Post: 761

\# Post Views on Second Most Popular Post: 149

\# More Views My Most Popular and got Over My Second Most Popular Post: 612  
  
The title of my Most Popular Post: [Feature: The Marvel Cinematic Universe](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2013/11/130-feature-marvel-cinematic-universe.html)  
  
What's going on there? That's weird.  

Why do I write the Column? To answer that question I'm going to call upon a bit of "well duh" wisdom I once heard - "People don't do something over and over again unless they enjoy doing it." I enjoy writing. It helps me process things. My mind tends to wander, this helps keep me focused. I focus on a topic or series of topics, I let it wander like crazy for 10 minutes to an hour while I write, then I go back to the rest of life. This is to prevent me diverting 20% of my brainpower to whatever it is I'd write about for the entire day. I write because I'm a fan of the process. I'm a fan of the result. I'm NOT a fan of editing, which is pretty obvious most of the thyme. Maybe someday I'll get super interested in design. If I DO get super interested in design, the first thing I'll do is leave Blogger for greener pastures. I want something more closely resembling a website than a blog. Of course, doing so would mean that I'd have to migrate all my old content over... and if I'm doing that with my hypothetically improved standards, I'd have to go back and reread all my old posts... correcting grammatical mistakes, formatting mistakes, spelling misteaks, and the occasional missing picture file.

  
And finally, I guess I should mention that this is all step 7 of my 102-step plan to take over the world.

So, in short, horray 200!

  
**Top 200: Columns** (see previous 199 Columns - and this one - not necessarily in that order) **Top 10: Quote Groups** 10\. XCKD - 7 9\. Family - 9 8\. Myself - 9 7\. Comedians - 10 6\. Random Strangers on the Internet - 11 5\. Hypothetical Quotes (like last Column) - 14 4\. Random Strangers in Person - 15 3\. Friends I Don't Talk to Every Week - 18 2\. Melissa - 18 (she's not in "family" or "friends", she's her own category) 1\. Friends - 55 **Top 5: Individual Quoters** 5\. Myself - 9 (this is a shameful practice) 4\. Danielle - 9 3\. Jon - 17 2\. Melissa - 18 1\. Josh - 23

Motto: No Half Measures

  
Let's take a quick look back at [Column #175 - "List of Projects"](http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/06/175-list-of-projects.html). These projects fall into two groups: **Things I have done since I wrote that post:**"My 25th Year" The Life Tracker Leave Windows Home Media Server/digital library 30 Day Challenges Android Development **Things I have not done since I wrote that post:**Comprehensive Review of Education Document aarongilly.com/wvz7x7.com Build a Computer Learn to Music - although I'm picking up Melissa's guitar a little more often than I used to Graduate School - I've done actual research. I know what steps I will be taking, but I haven't taken them yet. The "build a computer" thing I could do this weekend if I wanted to blow the money. That one got pushed back when I elected to build out my home media server using my laptop. Transitioning the Column from a blog to a website is something I could also do over a weekend, but hasn't happened yet. The other 3 things will take years to do, even if I started now. What's surprising to me is how many things I've done since that post. Seriously. I've kind of killed it, if I do say so myself. I want to speak a quick word on each project that has come to fruition:   

[![](assets/191-1.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qt3Ql9dPUoI/U-V8sQbC9-I/AAAAAAABbCo/wD5Gkrm3%5FSE/s1600/Screenshot%5F2014-08-08-20-42-44.png)

**My 25th Year**The whole "My Nth Year" project is easily one of my favorite things I've ever done. It's not a "surprise" that I finished "My 25th Year", considering where I was when I wrote that goal. It might be surprising that I finished the video on time given the next thing.  
  
Please ignore the "17 views" thing.

**Leave Windows**As I wrote about before, I made a simple and dumb mistake when trying to make my laptop into a dual-boot machine. I accidentally made the full, irreversible switch to Linux on a day that I originally chalked up to a lazy day watching TV on the couch. There have definitely been growing pains, but I've officially got my Linux laptop doing 99% of the things I want it to do... and I did it all legally, while spending zero dollars. When native Google Drive sync support comes to Linux my computer will do 100% of what I want it to do.

**Home Media Server/Digital Library**This is a goal that kind of just kept getting bigger and bigger. Not only did I set up a mutual media library for Melissa and I, not only did I set up a Home Media Server to access that library, not only did I find a way to add media to that server from my physical media library, but I figured out how to do so with a "zero-click" solution. I got several Marvel blu-rays from Melissa for my birthday. I made legal digital backups of these blu-rays simply by putting them in my computer. They even eject when they're done. I'm proud of this one.

  
Most of these are on my phone, you'll notice. It just so happened to be already plugged into my computer. Made it easy.

**30 Day Challenges**These stemmed from a New Year's resolution. I'm still doing them. This month in particular I'm hitting it extra hard. I haven't been on Reddit in a week. I built a custom workout plan. I'm following it. I fixed an issue the Life Tracker was having with Money tracking. I've done some work to buying another vehicle.

**Android Development**This project is not "done" per-say... but as of yesterday it's going very well. I have tried doing this on a few occasions in the past and have always given up before I could even get a "Hello world!" app running. I not only got a "Hello world!" app running on my computer, I got one with a scrollable list of text strings running on my phone. I'm VERY excited about this one. Wish I could shut myself in a cave with a computer and a phone for a month and just learn and create. I'm taking a free class on Udacity in Android development. Just finished Lesson 1 - built a super simple app called "Sunshine". When I complete Lesson 6, Sunshine will be a full-blown weather app that pulls the forecast for wherever your phone is from the web.

Seriously, how cool is that?

Motto: Labor Day = _Don't_ Go to Work? What?  
  
Last Column was very... focused. This time the glasses are coming off. Things are going to be nice and out-of-focus. I'm going to hit up the many things I've made not to write about since the two Columns ago.  
  
Idea for a novel:  
There's a large facility for cryogenically freezing people with terminal illnesses that has a few hundred of people on ice, including the protagonist. One day, the facility loses power & these hundreds of terminally ill people are unfrozen. They find the facility empty, but in tact. The nearby town is much the same. No damage, just no people. The book tells the story of these few hundred people as they try to figure out what happened, if they are the only humans left, and if they can even repopulate the earth before each of them goes from their own terminal condition. I'm aiming for post-apocalyptic without the apocalypse. Sort of an "I Am Legend" without the vampires & where Will Smith is hundreds of terminally ill people mixed with "The Martian" without being on Mars.  
I'm not writing it. You write it.  
  
I really appreciate good speakers. I enjoy listening to people who show a unique command of the English language. I like to imitate people with particularly pleasing patterns of speech, interesting intonations, vivid vocabularies, fantastic phrases, and/or an expressive, exquisite, exotic or eclectic, ear-catching and enjoyable eloquence. It is my ambition to become an ever-better story-teller, clearer communicator, well-woven writer, and outstanding orator. I want a large toolbox, full of techniques to handle any situation.  
  
Speaking of large toolboxes - now that I'm a homeowner, I literally want a large toolbox. I've converted my very simple L desk into an L desk where the bottom part of the L is now cut out, with a shelf accessible from either side. My plan for today/tomorrow is to use the wood I cut from the back wall of the desk to create a drawer for the other side of the desk. Never before have I appreciated so much what my dad has built with his collection of tools. I was using a jigsaw to do things that I know a circular saw or a table saw would be more adept at doing. I have really enjoyed creating stuff from nothing. I think it will become a thing that I do. My first project went fairly well, I'd say.  
  
[![](assets/296-1.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cd6vm7nxPD0/V8w2nE8-rmI/AAAAAAACa74/zoJPDo8aM%5F4Dr5mbgpKKsn-qQgdTEaJMwCKgB/s1600/IMG%5F20160827%5F114453.jpg)

  
As part of my newfound appreciation for building crap (remember how I just said I appreciate good writing?), I have decided to _not_ cannibalize the garage workshop that I inherited when I bought this house, turning it into the home gym I've always dreamed of. Instead, I am pretty sure I will utilize the unfinished portion of my basement as the gym. This was suggested to me by many people, and for good reason. It makes a lot more sense. I'm sure I'll write more about the aspirational home gym in the near-ish future. Suffice it to say for now: matted flooring, adjustable bench, half-rack, Olympic bar, 4 45s, 2 35s, 2 25s, 4 10s, 2 5s, some Olympic rings (maybe?), and a way to accomplish cardio. The space is \~14x8 ft, air conditioned/heated, and can be upgraded.  
  
Grilling is like cheating. Melissa and I have used our new grill about 10 times so far. We've achieved a 100% deliciousness rate. To be fair, Melissa did 9 out of those 10 times, but hey - I nailed it on that one time I made porkchops. I'm a fan of any cooking technique that lets you mass-produce foods.  
  
For the past \~2 years I bought into the notion of the "PC Master Race". For those not familiar, the basic idea is that people who buy video game consoles are dumb and that the PC is the one true place to really play games. For a while, I would have fought you if you disagreed with me. Battlefield 4 was my prime, shining example. It was good on the PS3, but **great** on the PC.  
Times have changed, though. New PC games (like the new Hitman game) don't run so well on my now 1.5 year old PC. "No big deal! The best part about PC gaming is the ability to upgrade your rig in a piecemeal fashion, thereby saving you money in the long run!" Yeah, that's bologna. The cost of [the next-level-up graphics card](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GAMING-GTX-980-4G/dp/B00NOP53AA/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1473002925&sr=1-1&keywords=gtx+980) (which isn't even [the new-hotness](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-GeForce-STRIX-Graphics-STRIX-GTX1080-A8G-GAMING/dp/B01K5F8MJK/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1473002941&sr=1-1&keywords=gtx+1080) anymore) is FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. You know what **else** I could get for $450?  
A PlayStation 4, spare controller, and 2 games.  
\- or -  
An Xbox 1, spare controller, all the Halo games, and still 2 more games.  
\- or -  
A Wii U, Nintendo 3DS XL, and Super Smash Bros for both  
Any of which is guaranteed to continue being able to play games without further upgrade for the next few years. Although at this point, I'm probably going to wait until the next-generation (or the "0.5 generation") of new hardware comes out. That would be "[Project Scorpio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox%5FOne#.22Project%5FScorpio.22)", the [PlayStation 4.5 Neo](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/8/12403198/sony-playstation-4-4k-event-september-report), and the [Nintendo NX](http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-nx-news/).  
The _other_ benefit of going the way of the console is that it doesn't promote you sitting tucked away in a corner by yourself with headphones on. It's much easier (read: possible at all) to play local multiplayer.

# Motto: Yaaaaaaay Debt!

It's Sunday night. This is the second of the scheduled updates. It's a going to be a nice, short post.

For the past 10 years of my life I have been a member of the car driving community, but not of the car owning community. I've been issued hand-me-downs and even a car of my own by my ridiculously supportive parents... but I've never really owned one.

Or, I *hadn't*, until yesterday when I bought a 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid. 

The specs I cared about:

- I can fit in it
- It has four tires
- It has an engine
- It gets >30 miles per gallon
- It was in my price range
- Bonus: it has another engine
- Bonus: it has Bluetooth (which I love)
- Bonus: it's push-button start
- Bonus: it looks alright (IMHO)

Without further ado (I say that pretending you hadn't already noticed this picture)...

Mark IV

I struggled coming up with a subtitle for that photo because it was to be the name of the vehicle. I was going to do an anagram for "Sonata Hybrid", but the list of acronyms I came up with were pretty unflattering...

- Rash Antibody
- Abstain, Hydro
- A Handy Bistro
- Brandy is Oath
- Hi, Yon Bastard!

"Mark IV" is much better.

That's the column, folks.

To go out on, here's a picture of me in a Hulk mask:

I think my face is a bit larger than this mask's intended audience


# Top 5: Drawbacks of Having Your Own, New Car
5. The "I'm getting a new car soon anyway" safety net is gone from your driving
4. You actually want to keep it clean, which takes effort
3. People assume you're an adult when you own a car despite pictures on the internet of you wearing masks designed for 11-year-olds proving that you're in no way mature
2. Keeping up with paperwork and legalities
1. Paying for your own car

Motto: Feel the Love  
  
I'd like to start this post by saying wedding showers are awesome. I suggest you have one as soon as you can. I have access to all sorts of great pots and pans now. How _not_ sarcastic I'm being right there scares me. If you told a younger me that I'd be excited by pans or a Crock Pot I would have laughed at you. You wouldn't even have to go back very far to find that version of me. 2 years ago I would have laughed at the idea. Not today. I guess that means I'm officially old. On a more serious note, Melissa and I's wedding shower in Wichita was this weekend. The response from the community was amazing. I speak for both of us when I say that the support, love, and acceptance we both felt was overwhelming. I owe my most sincere thank you to everyone who thought of us. Also in Wichita: Krista's birthday. Also in Wichita: I almost lost to a 9 year old in a game of Horsh. Also in Wichita: For an hour I threw a ball up a flight of stairs and caught it as it bounced its way down. Here's a poem. No, wait... Here's what (I'm calling) poetry. Really, it would be better denoted by the term "wordplay", but the tag I set up is _poetry._ So I'm calling it _poetry_. Really it's just me taking an idea and seeing how far I can make it go:  
  
* Left & Right & Wrong
* Love & War & Peace & Harmony
* Volunteer & Give & Take & Bake
* Bob & Tom & Jerry & Elaine (that one kind of feels like cheating)
* Thunder & Lightning & Thunder & Lightning &... (that one is definitely cheating)
  
Anyone else who can come up with a longer daisy chain of words commonly paired together, separated by "&" wins. No infinite loops, cheaters!  
Here's another thing I'll call a poem: I Need Information This Instant, Act Like I'm Simple Minded  
  
That was a mnemonic for the word "initialism" which used an initialism.  
  
Here's the picture to go out on - for those of us who thought for sure KU was going to beat Stanford and make it into the Sweet Sixteen:

It's been a little bit. I've been incredibly focused. 

Something occurred to me yesterday: **[I'M AN ADUUUUULT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ)**.

I'm 31 years old. It's not interesting to say the age-focused definition of adult has applied for quite some time now... I'm not saying that. I'm saying I finally *feel* like an adult. I remember the day I first bought a couch. I thought, "I own a couch... that's so *weird*." Couches weren't things I had to buy, they were just always... around. It was the first in many, many tangible steps that took me from "feeling" like a kid to "feeling" like an adult.

## Adult Things

- I graduated college
- I have been working a career job for approaching 10 years
- I'm married
- I'm a father
- I'm a homeowner
- I own two vehicles (outright)
- I understand how taxes work, for the most part
- I read nonfiction books for fun
- I've installed multiple sinks and various appliances
- I drink black coffee
- I own a table saw
- I have political opinions
- I worry about insurance and the environment
- I no longer exercise with the goal of "getting huge"
- I haven't ever installed a game on this phone
- I stripped and sealed my deck
- I'm excited by grilling
- I've cooked enough to be good at it... more on this in a bit
- I built furniture
- I own *several* couches

Basically, Aaron's mental prototype of himself has changed.

![[387-2.png]]

That isn't to say I've become boring. On the contrary, I'm more at ease with myself than ever before. I know that guy on the left is still in there. I also know that there's a lot more going on. I'm full of those multicolored balls from the movie Inside Out. I like to do detailed analyses of complex problems, and I like to laugh at fart jokes. Like I said: **[I'M AN ADUUUUULT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ)**.

I never thought I'd write something like this. What follows is *mostly* a review of a cookbook.

![book cover](assets/387-1.png)

Calling "[Cook Once, Eat All Week](https://fedandfit.com/cook-once-eat-all-week/)" by Cassy Joy Garcia a *"cookbook"* is doing it a bit of a disservice. True, it's a book full of recipes for making various types of meals; but they aren't just a set of unrelated recipes for which you *might* have the ingredients. This book is a full-blown food game plan... and a good one, at that.

My wife and I just finished the 26th (and final) week of this book. It feels like the end of something cool and new. We've never been so "into" cooking. We've never produced such high-quality food so consistently. Meals that would have been phenomenal to us 2 years ago are now essentially *average*. More important than any single set of recipes, the *mindset* of our entire kitchen has changed. We no longer have a refrigerator full of unrelated ingredients in bags that we *hope* to be able to throw together into some sort of recipe. Instead, we've front-loaded the preparation efforts and keep a fridge stocked with mostly-ready-to-go meal components. The "what should we make, what *can* we make" dilemma is gone. THAT is probably the most gratifying bit of the whole thing.

That plus we make dynamite food every day now.

# Top 5: Other Things I've Been Doing

1. Practicing guitar decently often
2. Doing a workout routine that involves rolling dice (which I'm about to go do so I'm officially rushing this Top 5)
3. Writing code actually very pretty often
4. Working my way through [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org)'s core curricula.
5. Putting out [a podcast](https://wesceneamovie.com/) every two weeks

Motto: You Can Never Achieve Perfection, You Can Only Get Closer

  
Transitional periods are difficult. Nothing will mess up your daily routines like knowing they will be changing soon. Since Melissa and I signed a lease on a new place, we've up-ended the usual routine. I look forward to moving not only because our new place will be much nicer than our current one, but also because it means we're hitting the reset button on a lot of things. We're starting from scratch. Establishing new habits. I'm a huge proponent of setting up healthy habits when you first enter a new environment. I think location drives behavior moreso than any other factor.  
**A review of February's "30" day challenge:** No TV No Videogames _(except on Thursdays)_ We did a great job of abiding by this rule until about halfway though the month. Then we started taking additional cheat days. By the end, the goal may has well have said "slightly less TV and videogames". I'm disappointed with my performance on this challenge. It's not that it was particularly difficult, I think. It was more just that I had other things on my mind and didn't really consider the challenge. I didn't think much about it. I'm going to take the month of March off. I want to give myself a break so I can re-dedicate to the 30 Day Challenge project come April. I'm excited for the future. March brings a new apartment, and exciting basketball games. April brings warmer temperatures. May brings Melissa and I's 1-year anniversary, the Avengers, and the start of Melissa's summer break. June & July bring the true summer break - vacations, home projects, other fun stuff. Good stuff is coming. The picture to go out on - I tried out that new Timbuk2 bag at REI:

Motto: Okay Google... what's your goal here?  

## Intro

This post is going to be an expansion on something I wrote about in [Column #354](http://www.aarongilly.com/354). It will (hopefully) complete the series of posts I've written lately about productivity software, Google, Getting Things Done, and all that. Specifically today I'm writing about Google products, and my growing disillusionment with them. This post will be thorough, longer than most, and generally more well put together.  

## Setting the Googley Stage

I'll caveat this up front by saying they are great on the whole, most of my quibbles are just that, quibbles, and that I have them because I'm a power user. I am in _deep_ with Google.

## What Google is doing right

I could write an entire book about what Google is doing right (and I wouldn't be the first). For the purposes of this post, though, I wanted to include some things that _are_ good, even if they are obvious. This section is not the main point of this post, though.  
  
Google products & services are, on the whole, completely free of charge. Many of them aren't even ad-supported. They just exist so that you will want to stay in the Google ecosystem. You could argue they are all still 100% self-serving, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that most of Google's products are a net benefit to humanity. Look at Android in developing countries. Look at the millions of people learning how to fix their sink using YouTube, and the YouTube creators making money\* for that benefit. Look at the absolute delight that is rediscovering old photos on Google Photos. Look at this writing platform I'm using for free. Look at all the innovations they have made in the realm of self-driving cars, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I am a firm believer that the world is a better place because Google is a thing.  
  
\*sort of  

## The biggest problem with Google

Google is a huge ship, with nearly 100,000 employees capable of influencing its momentum. To extend the "Google is a ship" metaphor, there are dozens of tugboats manned by hundreds of employees each, pulling in whatever direction serves their individual interests best. Sometimes tugboats come unmoored and sail off into the sunset (Google Reader, Inbox), other times two tugboats are pulling in completely _opposite_ directions (Google Hangouts vs Google Allo and Duo, Google Keep vs Google Tasks). Google isn't committed to any obvious direction.  
  
This creates uncertainty in what direction Google is going. Combine that uncertainty with the fact that you can't do anything offline, you are entirely dependent on them to keep their services up if you want to maintain workflow continuity. If you learn how to use a really great email client that supports reminders, snoozing, and the creation of tasks on the fly, it might just _go away_ one day because somebody in California decided it wasn't worth the effort. For a company that wants to help you make your life easier, they really aren't doing a good job of reassuring you that you'll be in good hands in 2 years.  

### Some Case Examples

What is Google doing with Reminders? My memory isn't perfect, but... When Inbox came out, Google introduced us to reminders. Reminders could be used for tasks, or literally just to remind you of something. Reminders were common between Google Inbox/Gmail, Google Keep, and Google Assistant... Then Google introduced a revamped Tasks app. These tasks were more purpose-built for _tasks_ than reminders are... but they didn't chose to integrate the two. They chose to maintain reminders and tasks separately. If you go to Google Calendar right now and click the FAB. See what options you get.  
  
  
[![](assets/374-1.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PxzJk1eajDI/XR52NJxghVI/AAAAAAAD%5Ft0/gSpxvk8iAK0fud6B6XG-DaC9JRBIjXQVACLcBGAs/s1600/googlegtd.png)

...and this is how they look _in_ the calendar itself:  

[![](assets/374-2.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8PDn5sEF02U/XR54BWYUtUI/AAAAAAAD%5FuA/HP7O4Ph2IYMVn1V%5F83L-ZHKW7wg8ePE7wCLcBGAs/s1600/sketch1562277863088.png)

My Google Home used to work with Google Keep. I could add tasks to my task list. I could add groceries to my shopping list. I could share those lists easily with my wife. We could create reminders to surface those lists when we went to our preferred grocery store. Then Google decided it wanted to promote it's "Express" service, so they broke the shopping list connection... and for good measure they decided to just not support _any_ connection between Assistant and Keep. After user outrage, Google relented _forcing_ you into Express... and instead created yet another location for those lists to reside.  
  
Google Fiber was going to take over the world. Now I'm just holding my breath until I read an article that Google has decided to spin Fiber off into its own, independent company. Or, worse, sell it off to some pre-existing internet provider. They definitely aren't pushing it like they once were. They definitely aren't looking to become a true nation-wide competitor to the incumbents. They aren't trying to shake it up.  
  
Google Play Music is being (replaced? turned into? developed alongside of?) YouTube Music. I have no faith it will be around, thus I didn't have any motivation to convince my wife we shouldn't use Spotify.  
  
Messaging Apps. Google Chat. Google Voice. Google Hangouts. Google Allo. Google Duo. Andriod Messages. Hangouts _Chat_. Hangouts _Meet_.  
  
You get the idea. <https://killedbygoogle.com/> shouldn't have to exist.  

### Increasingly Attractive Alternative

I have not been a member of the Apple ecosystem for long. I have had an iPhone for less than a year. Upon making the switch, I didn't jump in with both feet. Some of the _first_ apps I installed were Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.  
  
But.  
  
The other day Apple had their WWDC announcements. They announced a lot of new features coming to their notes app. It didn't make their notes app a revolutionary new entry into the notetaking application namespace... but they made it _better_. They didn't put out something entirely different. I thought "man, wouldn't it be nice just to _know_ that an app you are trusting is going to be around and supported for the long-haul?" I realized I will _never_ really feel that way about anything Google does ever again. I think that Gmail and Google Drive/Docs are staying around. They will probably retain some core set of features, but anything beyond that... I don't want to come to rely on.  

### Conclusion

Google is a great and wonderful company. It is wildly successful, and for good reason. But if Google doesn't give its users a reason to believe that they can depend on their services long-term, they are going to have more power users like me looking for alternatives with staying power... and that's a shame to say about one of the top 20 biggest companies in the world.   
  
Only somewhat unrelated to the body of this post - I've been thinking about changing up the Column. Blogger is fine, but it feels like it could be better on some other platform.   
  
Hey I just found out I can type emoji in here. 💩  
  
Top 5: Changes Google could do to make me fully back on board  
5\. Settle on one messaging service. Make it available on Android, ios, and chrome. You know, like Hangouts. Just commit to Hangouts. JUST MAKE HANGOUTS YOUR STRATEGY GOING FORWARD! REBRAND IF YOU HAVE TO BUT MIGRATE THE SERVICE!  
4\. Keep building out Keep. If Google gets rid of Keep, I'm going to lose it. There are a lot of really obvious features they could add.  
3\. Google could just acknowledge their image publicly. Right now it seems like they are pretending this problem doesn't exist, when clearly it does. The first step before fixing a problem is admitting that you have one.  
2\. Supporting Markdown across their products. Don't make me use my mouse.  
1\. They come out with some sort of a statement giving a list of services they will support and integrate together for the next 10+ years.

Motto: ACTION  
  
Big things are brewing.  
  
I am watching Captain America: The First Avenger. I have made a playlist on my Plex server of all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the order in which they took place within their universe. This is the first of them. Age of Ultron comes out on bluray in a week. I am going to rewatch the entire MCU, ending with Age of Ultron after I get that.  
  
Captain America: Civil War premiers in 222 days. There's 4500 minutes worth of Marvel Content out right now. That's only one minute of Marvel content every 1 1/4 hours. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 3, Agent Carter season 2, and at least one new Netflix series will take place between now and then. I'M GOING TO WATCH IT ALL.  
  
I didn't actually want to write about the Life Tracker - but when I realized I was writing about tech stuff and Marvel stuff, I thought adding this paragraph would be funny:  
  
I was forced to rewrite a portion of the Life Tracker when my weather API provider decided to close down their service for users of their free tier. Thankfully, my 2nd rewrite of the Life Tracker was written with each of its functional piece parts nicely separated. All I had to do to fix it was find another free weather history API provider (the hard part) and change my API handler (the easy part). Whole thing took less than an afternoon to successfully implement.  
  
As promised - here's some tech stuff:

That's Melissa's new phone. It's a 64 GB, Rose Gold iPhone 6S Plus. It's ginormous... and awesome. I was hard on the Nexus 6 last year, partially for its size... but now I think I'd like something a little bigger than what I've got. Luckily this Tuesday is Google Nexus event. Soon I'll have the opportunity to get something a little bigger - and I'm looking forward to it now more than ever. More on that next time.  
  
Captain America is the best, by the way. He's a great superhero. This movie is great.   
  
Top 5: Things I Do That Make Me Say "WHY DON'T I DO THIS MORE OFTEN"  
5\. HIIT - or really any sustained max-effort exercise  
4\. Getting _way_ ahead on administrative stuff - cleaning, organizing, and preparing everything  
3\. Shopping at Costco  
2\. Using my GoPros, for anything  
1\. Seeing friends & family and doing things

Motto: Round and Round We Go

  
Routine.

  
Imagine life without it. It would be chaos. Everyone has routines they go through every day. You do the same things in the same ways. Try putting your pants on starting with your off-leg and you'll see what I mean. It feels weird. 

  
We have little routines. We have big ones. Our big routines are made up of little ones. Butting routines together forms a loop. These loops exist at different levels, too. You loop your mornings, your afternoons, your evenings. You loop your days. You loop your weeks. On a long enough timeline, your months and years take on similar characteristics. 

  
You wake up. You prep for work. You commute. You manage tasks and email until lunch. You eat. You manage tasks and email until it's time to leave. You commute. You do a hobby. You cook food. You eat. You entertain yourself. You sleep. Loop.

  
You work. You work. You work. You work. You work. You engage in social activities. You gather and organize and prepare for the week. Loop.

  
This is all necessary to be successful. If you didn't have established routines, you'd spend a lot of your day bumbling around trying to figure out why nothing is working. You know how to get things done because you know what works. You know what makes you happy. You do what breeds success and it makes you successful. You do what breeds happiness and it makes you happy. But as you do your successful, happy little loops _(as Bob Ross would call them)_, the flaws in them become more obvious. The gaps in what they accomplish grow as your body and brain adapt to better accomplish what's in the loops you run.

  
Let me wrap it into an example:

Mondays are leg days.

Tuesdays are chest and tris.

Wednesdays are break.

Thursdays are back and bis.

Fridays are burnout leg days.

Saturdays are burnout all upper body.

Sundays are break.

Loop.

  
Now you're strong. Now you're cut. 

But you can't run. You can't touch your toes or scratch your own back.

  
Now let me rap it into an example:

Yo.

You write down tasks.

Do what your boss asks.

Communicate effectively.

Collaborate selectively.

Master spreadsheets and lists.

Faster than life cheats, it's this

that will make you good employee.

That will take you, wait and see.

  
If you fail to consider bigger notions,

don't set sail to some broader oceans,

you will trail when it's time for promotions.

Dawg.

  
That whole thing was me talking about focusing on getting things done to further a project, in lieu of focusing on getting things done to further a career. Hopefully those two things overlap.

  
Anyway.

  
The challenge I'm facing now is addressing these shortcomings. Covering the gaps. Can you construct a loop that covers all the bases? I think that's what I have been trying with some of the projects I've been running for the past 4 or 5 years... but the longer a project goes, the more you revert back to base behavior. I set goals, do a great job with them at first, but after a bit I'm back to baseline Aaron. The goal is present, but the change in behavior is not. 

I set up my Life Tracker with 25 daily goals so that I'd try to accomplish them. 

I started filming a second a day so that I'd make sure each day had an interesting second. 

I started 30 Day Challenges to try out intentionally and selectively break routines. 

I've learned a lot from all of those things over the years. But what I've learned from them lately is that they aren't as motivating as they once were. The law of diminishing returns is in full effect. Just like how constantly doing the same happy loops will cause them to bring less and less joy.

  
I don't fault myself for doing any of those things I do. I've been intentionally trying to better myself. I won't rest on my laurels. Even if the things I try are 90% ineffective, I'll be 10% better off for it. At least that's the theory.

  
I'm going to sunset the Life Tracker in 6 months. I've been at it for 4.5 years. It's done what I wanted it to do. I've learned a lot from it... and I'm not sure I'll ever _really_ fully stop tracking things. But it's time for something new. I want to implement what I've learned to build something better of myself and for myself. I want my loops to contain more intentionally unintentional sections. Variety is the spice of life. 

  
Let the chips fall where they may.

Say Yes more.

Live more.

I'm ready for what's next.

With all that said, if your black X is co-located with your blue circle, by all means, take the red path.  
  
Top 5: Other Things I've Thought About Lately

5\. This one is stupid and obvious, but: 

Efficiency = (Effective Actions)/(Total Actions)  

If you're doing something that's not wholly effective, then your efficiency sucks.  
4\. Similarly, the effective thing to do is not always the easy thing to do. But the thing that's most effective winds up being easiest in the end. Through the Transitive Property of Equality, the easiest thing to do isn't the easy thing to do.  
3\. The great smartphone plateau started somewhere around 2015\. Once the iPhone got bigger, it stopped really getting better. My Nexus 6P is two years old, and it's still a phenomenal device. I don't think we'll see another "must-have" upgrade until our phones stop being little slates we carry around.  
2\. Rick and Morty is a great show... but it's the kind of great show that I wouldn't really recommend to most people. It's a great show to those who think it's a great show.  
1\. Allergies suck.

# Motto: These “numbers” have been wrong for about 10 years

So, this is the “new” column.

I use quotation marks because this is the 5th iteration of “the column”. This one will hopefully move its way from the 5th longest used version to the first - as I don’t anticipate moving it again. Blogger is a Google-backed product. So long as that’s true, I figure it’s pretty much here to stay. The point of these “Bloggers” is to write “Blogs”. Seems logical. That’s essentially what this is (except, instead of sticking to a central theme that’s relevant to society and somehow helpful, I’ll just write about whatever and be wildly unproductive).

I estimate that I’ve probably written between 300 and 400 of these things in the past. This exact template has been the used for most of them (save the Tumblrs) so it seems like a winning combination. I’ll stick with this. Quick Evaluation of Blogger: I can **Bold** *Italic* & Underline quite easily. (even ~~strikethrough~~) I can change the color of my text. I can insert links. I can insert YouTube videos easily (this might come in handy soon? (hint)

I can insert page breaks (there isn’t one here… but after the quote there is) I can center my text or even right-align it I can make my text seem more justifiable by justifying it. I did that, but if your browser is too wide you won’t be able to tell (and you have a HUGE monitor). insert numbered lists like this

or bullets like these Or quotes (this seems more like an indention than a quote) I can be a teenage girl and change the background of my text.

And change font.

I’m using “Trebuchet” by the way, because if I were a midevil war machine that’s what I’d be.

This should be fun. Sorry this was boring.
